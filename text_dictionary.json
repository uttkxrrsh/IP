Reddy, Governor,  Reserve Bank of India and Leader of the Indian Delegation  On behalf of  Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Sri Lanka      Statement by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Gov ernor, Reserve Bank of India and Leader of the Indian Delegation To the International Monetary and Financial Committee(IMFC), Washington, D.C., April 24, 2004 Representing the Constituency consisting of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Sri Lanka Mr. Chairman The Global Economy and Financial Ma rkets \u2013 Sustaining the Recovery 1. The global economic environment has imp roved significantly since we met last September in Dubai when the outlook for th e global economy was weighed down by some uncertainties and risks. The recent strengthening of the global recovery process has been led by  buoyant growth in emerging Asia, especial ly China and India and,  of course by a robust turnaround in the US.  Incipient recovery appear s to have set in in the Euro area while the economic activity in Japan has exceeded expectations. The resurgent growth in many emerging market economies (EMEs)  is now accompanied by significant resilience and EMEs are now positively contributing to the world growth. The determinants of global growth and the policy requirements for sustai ning the present momentum, both at regional and multilateral levels, need to be evaluated in the light of this beginning of a significant rebalancing of economic strengths and activity.  2. The improved global recovery has been accompanied by a strong acceleration in world merchandise trade, particularly from emerging Asia, Japan and Euro Area. With renewed improvement in sentiment, investment has also picked-up in most regions, which should in the normal course augur well for su staining the recovery process. Reflecting improved investment opport unities and receding systemic risk s, capital flows to emerging markets have also improved. At the same time, the risk of de flation in several industrial countries has begun to subside with growing recovery and rising commodity prices. Risks have been mitigated by improved liability management through readjustment of maturity structure of external debt, build up of foreig n exchange reserves, and improved credit quality. The domestic bond market has also received adde d fillip in many countries. International financial markets have remained orderly and buoyant. While resilience against shocks in EMEs has strengthened, it is still an open  question whether the anecdotal \u201cherding behaviour\u201d of investors is tempered by the \u201cm aturation process\u201d of the investing community  across the globe .  This factor continues to be a crit ical issue for policy-makers in EMEs. 3. Although overall global growth prospects have improved markedly, uncertainties still remain. Significant challenges and risks which still persist include possibilities of disruptive global currency adjustments, continued structural  problems and hardening of interest rates. The impact of currency and interest rate move ments needs to be carefully assessed on the balance sheets of households, corporates and fi nancial institutions. While the adjustment of the US dollar has been orderly so far, there is  a need to be vigilant about  inflation and interest rate  risks that could be generated in the pro cess of correction of the high order of current external  imbalances.   - 2 -  4. To sustain the recovery process and to correct the global imbalances in an orderly manner, there is an imperative need for a coordinated and cooper ative approach. Key elements of this coordinated approach should include different policy responses in different countries/regions. In the US, there is need to  curb household and government borrowings and strengthen national savings. However, US polic ies would need to delicately balance a gradual withdrawal of fiscal stimulus without hurting the recovery and, at the same time, without disruptive adjustment of the US dollar. The Eu ro area, which continues to depend largely on external demand, needs to pursue some structural  reforms, especially labour policies, to boost domestic demand and broa d-base the recovery. Japan need s to continue to take some concrete measures to strengthen its financia l system, restructure the corporate sector, and reduce large fiscal imbalances. There is a growing perception that  flexibility in exchange rate policies in emerging market economies in Asia is worth  considering on pragmatic grounds but as appropriate to each country\u2019s ci rcumstances.  As the recovery gains further momentum, interest rates which ar e at historically lows, may ha ve a tendency to firm up. The transition to higher interest rates would have to be managed carefully, particularly in countries with high household indebtedness and exposure to hous ing and mortgage markets.  5.  There is need for bold leadership in resolving some of the issues confronting the international community. Despite the fact that past episodes of crises  have exposed various deficiencies of the international financial system , progress towards developing a sound system has been slow. Accumulation of foreign exchange reserves by several Asian countries seems to be not only linked to the exchange rate policies and the related trade  as well as  employment implications but also,  to the  l ack of confidence of these countries in the existing architecture. Concrete steps need to be initiated in right earnest to redesign the international financial architecture. There is also a need to move swiftly in reviving trade talks. The protectionist postures by industrialised  countries need to be shed, particularly in agriculture and textiles sectors, especially when developing countries have  started, at last, to get out of their protectionist mindsets. Devel oping countries are increasingly realising that trade is, after all, not a zero sum game but a win-win proposition for both the trading partners. In this context,  as presented eloquently by most eminent policy-makers in industrialized countries,  the recent protectionist  measures by some countries against business process outsourcing misses out not only the effi ciency gains from such outsourcing but also the employment gains from resources save d in the process and deployed in other employment generating sectors.  6. Coming to countries in my constituency,  I would like to mention that their performance has been a matter of satisfaction . The Indian economy has moved on to a high growth path. The GDP growth of India during 2003-04 is expected to be over 8 percent. Following good monsoons, the agriculture grow th has rebounded and is expected to be over 10 per cent. Industrial sector continues to remain buoyant. The corporate restructuring undertaken in recent years and further opening up of the external sector have started to yield dividends through higher productivity and better balance sheet management. Various indicators suggest that the i nvestment climate during the ye ar has improved considerably. Infrastructure has been accorded renewed priority . India\u2019s external sector continues to be a source of strength. In particular, exports witn essed robust growth desp ite not so favourable an external environment. Growing export of services and remittances have helped maintain a  - 3 -  marginal surplus in the current account in sp ite of a growing trade deficit. Reflecting the improved fundamentals, capital in flows have been buoyant, but manageable for the conduct of monetary policy. The health of the financial sector has also been improving. Improved risk management measures have enabled an absolu te reduction in the non-performing assets of the public sector banks for the first time since the initiation of reforms. Financial markets in general and the equity markets in particul ar have demonstrated robust performance. Notwithstanding some pressure on prices at the beginning of the year, inflation continues to be under control. The main challenge of macr oeconomic management t oday continues to be fiscal consolidation. However, there are de finitive signs of progress towards deficit reduction. The fiscal deficit of the central government as a proportion of GDP has also declined considerably.  Revenues are buoyant, the disinves tment programme has picked up speed, and expenditure control and management measures are firmly in place. The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Acts, opera ting at the Centre and several States can be expected to deliver solid progre ss on the fiscal consolidation front.  7. Sri Lanka has made further progress in 2003 towards economic stability and recovery with the continuation of sound m acroeconomic policies and struct ural reforms in the context of the continuing ceasefire, and improvement s in the global economic environment. The international community has extended support for the govern ment\u2019s economic progress and peace process. Th ere were  elections in early April and a new government is in place. The Sri Lankan authorities are committed to making fu rther progress on the peace front, growth and poverty reduction and to sustain macroeconomic  stability.The new government will continue  discussions with the Fund on the  Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility/Extended Fund Facility (PRGF/EFF)  arrangement. 8. Bangladesh has continued steadfast imple mentation of reform measures under the PRGF program with a view to moving the econo my to a higher and sustainable growth path. Substantial progress has been made in imple menting an ambitious agenda of reform measures. A composite strategy is being pursued to mitigate the risks arising from the scheduled phasing out of MFA quotas at end-2004 . Some differences, which are inevitable in a democracy, should not make the interna tional community feel that the country\u2019s commitment to economic reforms is lagging. Bang ladesh values the financial and technical assistance from the international community. 9. Bhutan continues to experience strong ma croeconomic performance with a robust real GDP growth and subdued inflation. Keeping in vi ew the strategy to benefit from integration with the rest of the world and through member ship of multilateral bodies including the World Trade Organization (WTO), Bhutan is under taking important structural reforms and strengthening the institutional framework. Crisis Prevention and IMF Surveillance across the Membership: Priorities, Tools and  Modalities 10. We welcome the initiatives taken by the IM F to strengthen the overall framework of bilateral and mu ltilateral surveillance. The recent initiatives undertaken by the Fund including the proposal to integrate the \u2018bal ance sheet approach\u2019 into Fund operations,  the  - 4 -  proposal to redesign the framework for debt su stainability in low-income countries and the recent decision to further strengthen data provision under IMF\u2019s Article VIII Section 5, reflects the Fund\u2019s commitment towards adoptin g an effective framework for vulnerability assessment. While the above measures will he lp member countries to strengthen their statistical systems and for the Fund to enhan ce the value of country-specific information system, it is essential to emphasize that th e cooperative  and voluntary nature of data provisioning as laid down under the Article needs to be preserved.  11. For  strengthening surveillance, we welc ome the thorough analysis of its various dimensions proposed for the next biennial revi ew, including an impact analysis in select countries . We  welcome  a separate study on impact analysis . There is an increasing feeling that the framework of surveillance should be mo re focused in terms of its objectives and targets. While strengthening  vulnerability assessment is an important element of the surveillance process, the funda mental objective of surveillance is to review and analyse macroeconomic policies for ensuring the soundne ss and stability of the domestic as well as the international monetary and payment system. 12. The increasing complexity of financial markets have rendered  the existing instruments of surveillance such as  Article IV consultations , Financial Sector Assessment Program/Financial System Stability Assessment (FSAP/FSSA), and Reports on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSCs) le ss effective than what was assumed so far,  in identifying and preventing crises. In this context, ther e may be a need to reach an  appropriate framework of vulnerability assessment based on high frequency data, duly taking into account data availability a nd methodological details . Second, integrating the use of high frequency data into the IMF surveillance process would also require a successful identification of  more stable methodological apparatus as compared to the ones that are presently available. Third, the Fund may requi re rebalancing its obj ective of vulnerability assessments with respect to developed countries vis-\u00e0-vis  developing countries, given the increasing empirical evidence that the primary maladjustments that lead to crises have sometimes emanated from devel oped financial markets.  Fina lly and perhaps of paramount importance,  we would like to stress that increased transparency resulting from assessments of a member country\u2019s incipien t vulnerabilities may, in turn, ex acerbate a crisis  even when such a country does not face any liquidity problems and its macro economic conditions are stable. Thus, there is need to reconsider the issue of the optimal degree of transparency in such vulnerability assessments.  Enhancing IMF Support to Low-Income Members: Instruments and Financing; IMF \u2013 World Bank Collaboration; and Promoting Debt Sustainability 13. The official development assistance (ODA) by to de veloping countries falls significantly short of the committed target of  0.7 per cent of their gross national product (GNP). Further, a large part of the actual in crease has been directed not to financing the incremental cost of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) but enlarging the scope of debt forgiveness or aiding the war on terror, thus  crowding out development aid. Net official flows to developing countries ha ve in fact declined. There is also no clear picture emerging that donors have moved towards targeting aid better for countri es with better policies and  - 5 -  institutions, and away from imposing excessive transaction costs on recipients, thereby impairing efficiency. 14. The efforts put by the IMF together with the World Bank towards poverty reduction, debt sustainability and achieving Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are commendable. We appreciate th e emphasis on efficient use of available resources, providing cushions for exogenous shocks, expanding th e institutional capacity, managing additional resources, and chalking out pragmatic and e ffective debt restructuring mechanism. The recent studies on different aspects of financing should help to improve the flow of funds to Low Income Countries (LICs)  and  also strengthen their capacity to  withstand exogenous shocks and service their debt without  jeopardizing their economic growth.  We agree that the focus for future Fund engagement with LICs s hould include (a) an asse ssment of policies, (b) dealing with shocks, (c) technical assistance,  (d) donor support coordination, and (e) debt sustainability analysis for donors. 15. Given the likely scenario of reduced annual  lending capacity under the self-sustained PRGF programme from 2006, there exists a need for additional resources. To ensure efficient use of available resources, concessional arrang ements should be made more effective without going for substantial changes in existing arrang ements. We support greater selectivity in use of PRGF resources and tapering of access norms for successive arrangements. On the proposed amendments in instrume nts and financing for PRGF, the efforts for clarifying blend criteria, formalizing the low access PRGF arrangements are welcome. Greater clarity in the principles of PRGF augmentation for addressi ng exogenous shocks and the need for Fund engagement with emergency pos t-conflict countries are also necessary.We are not in favour of duplicating surveillance in the form of Enhanced Monitoring Policy (EMP). The drawing up of an explicit exit strategy and introduction of diffe rentiated rate of charge for prolonged users as a signaling device appear necessa ry. Moreover, a staff monitored programme, preferably after the second/third PRGF a rrangement, may ensure improved ownership. Considering the required efforts to be put up by the LICs in balancing their needs for resources and ability to service their debt, we  are in favour of deve loping an operational framework for debt sustainability and promoting  LICs\u2019 economic growth. 16. While it is widely recognised that rising exports could effectively reduce debt service burden, for the LICs the quantum of exports has fallen short of the desired target. In this context, there is a need to focus on remittances  as a supplementary source of resources to mitigate debt service burden. However, while trade in commodities has expanded over the years, and cross border capital flows exploded, growth in mobility of labour has not been  encouraging. Moreover, the demographic trans ition in advanced economies with a declining proportion of the population in the working-age adds urgency to the consideration of the issue of cross border mobility of labor. The International Financial Institutions (IFIs)  can play a crucial role in developing a harmonise d framework for enhancing cross-border  labour movement  and channeling of remittances.   - 6 -  Progress with crisis resolution initiatives 17. Designing a globally accepted institutional framework has been the core issue for achieving \u201cprivate sector invol vement\u201d in crises resolution. The introduction of \u2018Collective Action Clauses (CACs)\u2019 in sovereign bonds is in creasingly being recognized as a tool that would help mitigate the problems associated  with the free rider and holdout litigation involved in debt restructuring exercises. In th is context, we welcome the recent inclusion of CACs in many of the sovereign debt issu es which has not resulted in any additional premium. The role of the IMF and other for a such as the G-10 in popularising the concept has been commendable. The efforts to devel op a 'Code of Conduct\u2019 by initiatives from G-20, in addressing the coordination pr oblems that arise in a restructuring exercise is valuable and proactive. However, a prescriptive or standard ized approach should not be followed in the formulation of the Code and the role of the IFIs should be limited to providing overall support to the development of such a code. Fi nally, we welcome the adoption of the Evian Approach by the Paris Club for redressing de bt sustainability concerns of the non-HIPC countries.  Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism 18. We reiterate that  India  vehemently oppos es all forms of terrorism. We also restate our commitment to fight against the abuses of the financial system, including money laundering and terrorism financing. In I ndia, a comprehensive Prevention of Money Laundering Act has been passed to deal with money laundering and financing of terrorism. 19. We commend the Fund/Bank staff on the ove rall success of the pilot program and also welcome the participation by the  Financ ial Action Task Force (FATF)  and the FATF Style Regional Bodies  (FSRB) in the pilo t progrm. The primary objective of the Pilot program has been achieved through the deepenin g of international atte ntion to  Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Te rrorism (AML/CFT)  issues. However, on AML/CFT issues, the Fund should remain within its mandate as laid out  in its Articles of Agreement, without getting involved in la w enforcement or non-macroeconomic issues. Proliferation of areas beyond its core competence may dilute the Fund\u2019s efficiency in its core area of functioning. Such an involvement ma y also not augur well for the co-operative principles that must underpin IFIs\u2019 engagement in this area . It may be desirable to maintain the current policy of limiting the IMF/Bank invol vement to responsib ilities for assessment. For rest of the work, the independent AML experts should be fina nced from external resources. IMF Quotas, Voice a nd Representation 20. The problem of a  democratic deficit and transparency in IMF\u2019s governance is well-recognized. The public discussion about the pro cess of appointing a new Managing Director has again brought this issue into sharp focus. A number of measures have been suggested  to strengthen voice and representation of the deve loping countries. We are supportive of the proposals to provide increased administrativ e and technological support to multi member constituencies to increase their effectiveness. We are also open to considering additional  - 7 -  chairs to make the two very large African constituencies more manageable. However, we have concerns that the Boards may become unwieldy, unless immediate consideration is given to merging or reducing the number of chai rs allotted to countries that are one monetary union and/or one trading bloc.  21. We reiterate  that these measures are not a subs titute to real reforms,   i.e.,  structural changes in the Board and reform of quota form ulas and voting rights. It is worthwhile recalling that similar discussions last year culminated merely in some additional posts being created in the two largest constituencies. For real and substantive reform, a package of measures must be adopted simu ltaneously, and the central issue,  namely distribution of voting rights and representation of member countries on the Executive Board,  addressed squarely. We appreciate the enormous complex ities involved in such an exercise, but the current state of impasse on this owes a great deal to the reluctance of the major shareholders to give up their present disproportionate strengths.   22. The present quotas, based on a flawed formul a with variables and weights chosen to produce a pre-determined result, do not reflect pos itions that are truly representative of many countries\u2019 profile in the world economy. A ne w formula based on a transparent and objective set of  criteria is needed.  In order to be truly representative of the size of economy and capacity to contribute to Fund resources, th e chosen formula should assign maximum weights to GDP and reserves, and GDP should be computed on  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms. This could be accompanied by increasing the share of basic votes which have declined from 12.1 percent of the total at the time of Fund\u2019s inception, to just 2.1 percent.  It may also be worthwhile to review the require ment of supermajority for important decisions. In conclusion, we would like to emphasize th e need for a comprehensive approach, as piecemeal measures implemented singly will have only a marginal overall impact for developing countries as a whole.  Activities of the Independent Evaluation Office (IEO)  23. The Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) set up in July 2001 continues to play an important role. The IEO has come out with final reports on three topics and are in the process of completing another three studies. All the th ree reports released so far have been well received. They have provided an objective assessment of arguably some of the most controversial and contentious i ssues relating to the functioning of the Fund.  The IEO has lived up to the expectation. Thank you.   ", "12 Feb 05 MP.pdf": "Monetary Policy: An Outline*Respected Vice-Chancellor Professor Simhadri, Professor Bhanoji Rao,Professor K.C. Reddy, and fellow-members of Andhra Pradesh Economic Association.I am thankful to the organisers for inviting me to be the President and deliver thePresidential Address.  There are several reasons for my being keen to be inVisakhapatnam to deliver the Presidential Address. I commenced my career inGovernment of Andhra Pradesh in Visakhapatnam as Assistant Collector UnderTraining over forty years ago - in 1965.  I had the benefit of professional guidancefrom eminent scholars and economists in Andhra University such as ProfessorsSarveswara Rao garu, D.V. Ramana garu, G. Parthasarathy garu, K.V. Ramana garuand S. Chandrasekhar garu. Subsequently, I acquired many friends with strong linkshere, such as Professors Krishnamurthy garu and R. Radhakrishna garu.  ProfessorBhanoji Rao garu has been a valued friend, whether he was in the World Bank withme, or in Singapore or in the Administrative Staff College in Hyderabad.  ProfessorK.C. Reddy garu worked alongside me when I was the Secretary in Planning andFinance Department of the Government of Andhra Pradesh.  With all theseattractions, I regret to say that I am not able to be physically present inVisakhapatnam to deliver the Presidential Address at the 23rd Annual Conference dueto unavoidable official commitments.The Andhra Pradesh Economic Association has been one of the pioneeringefforts in our country in organising a sub-national level professional body ofeconomists.  I have no doubt that it is a wise initiative and needs to be carried forward.As the economic reform in India progresses, the relative balance in public policy wouldshift in favour of the states relative to the centre.  The important areas earmarked forthe centre, such as external sector and financial sector, tend to be subjected toglobalisation while in areas such as education, health, sanitation, roads, water works,power, etc. which are localized in nature, states could have a greater role.  Greatermarketisation of economies and private capital flows tend to look for conducivegovernance at the state-level where economic activities are located. Hence, the stategovernments are well advised to take dynamic policy-initiatives and it is in thisbackground that the economists engaged at the state level have to play a crucial rolein the reform-process.  In fact, there is some evidence of a positive link between                                                                * Presidential Address by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India circulated in the Annual Conferenceof Andhra Pradesh Economic Association, on February 12, 2005 at Visakhapatnam.2education health and other public services and economic growth.  Interestingly, moststates which have done well in terms of investment and growth also have researchinstitutes of repute in the area of social and economic sciences.Needless to say that, in this background, I am delighted to deliver thePresidential Address at the Annual Conference of Andhra Pradesh EconomicAssociation.  In a conference of economists, it is appropriate to go by the principle ofcomparative advantage, and accordingly I decided to focus my comments on the coreof my current professional as well as official preoccupation and talk on the monetarypolicy.In its conduct of monetary policy, the central bank responds to the evolvingeconomic activity within an articulated monetary policy framework. This frameworkwould normally have three basic constituents, viz.,\u2022 the objectives of monetary policy;\u2022 the analytics of monetary policy focusing on the transmissionmechanism; and\u2022 the operating procedure focusing on operating targets and instruments.For convenience, each of these issues has been dealt with separately and inthis light, the Indian experience has been touched upon briefly.ObjectivesTraditionally, central banks have pursued the twin objectives of price stabilityand growth. Central banks have to keep in view the considerations of exchange ratestability and financial stability also in pursuing the basic objectives. Can we achievethese objectives all at a time?  As in most aspects of life, the objectives of monetarypolicy are interrelated, and there are trade- offs as well. Illustratively, economists oftentalk of the Phillips curve according to which there is a short-run negative relationbetween inflation and unemployment. While there are various viewpoints on Phillipscurve, in a world where the Phillips curve is valid, a central bank can reduce inflationonly at the cost of having more unemployment. Similar trade- offs exist among otherobjectives as well.Faced with multiple objectives that are equally desirable, there remains theproblem of assigning to each policy instrument the most appropriate objective.Accordingly, there is a broad consensus, both in academic and policy circles, that3monetary policy is useful as an instrument to achieving the goal of price stability.The adoption of price stability as the only objective of monetary policy is,however, by no means universal. While a number of prominent central banks includingthe European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan have adopted pricestability as the single objective of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve of the UScontinues to pursue multiple objectives of monetary policy, viz., a) maximumemployment, b) stable prices, and c) moderate long-term interest rates. Central banksin several developing countries have placed exchange rate management as anotherimportant policy objective. In recent years, particularly after the financial crises of1990s, the concern for financial stability is an integral part of the central bank\u2019sactivism.Analytics of Monetary PolicyThe process through which changes in the monetary policy get transmitted tothe ultimate objectives like inflation or growth has come to be known as \u201cmonetarytransmission mechanism\u201d. Interestingly, economists often refer to the channels of\u201cmonetary transmission\u201d as a black box \u2013 implying that we know that monetary policydoes influence output and inflation but we do not know for certain how precisely itdoes so. Nevertheless, in the literature, a number of transmission channels have beenidentified: (a) the quantum channel (e.g., relating to money supply and credit); (b) theinterest rate channel; (c) the exchange rate channel; and (d) the asset price channel.How these channels function in a given economy depends on the stage ofdevelopment of the economy and its underlying financial structure.  Illustratively, in anopen economy one would expect the exchange rate channel to be important; similarly,in an economy where banks are the major source of finance (as against the capitalmarket), credit channel seems to be a major conduit for monetary transmission.Besides, it needs to be noted that these channels are not mutually exclusive \u2013 in fact,there could be considerable feedbacks and interactions among them.Central banks may not be in a position to directly achieve their ultimateobjectives and hence, monetary policy is often formulated in terms of an intermediatetarget. For example, in a monetary targeting framework, a suitable monetaryaggregate is considered as an intermediate target based on the basic relationshipbetween money, output and prices. Exchange rate as an intermediate target can besuitable for small open economies, setting the exchange rate against a low-inflation4anchor country. This may, however, entail loss of independence in steering domesticinterest rates.In this context, it is necessary to touch upon what is known as the \u2018impossibletrinity\u2019, or \u2018 trilemma\u2019 of monetary policy. This refers to the incompatibility among threepolicy choices, viz., (a) fixed exchange rate, (b) open capital account, and (c)independent monetary policy. The basic message of the \u2018 trilemma\u2019 is that a centralbank can achieve any two of the above-mentioned parameters, but not all the three.Illustratively, if a country wants to have fixed exchange rate and independentmonetary policy then it is difficult to maintain an open capital account.Another important issue in monetary policy is the extent of transparency.Central bankers all over the world are not exactly known for clarity in their language.Nevertheless, the rational expectations school in macroeconomics holds that no policycan be successful over a period by \u201cfooling\u201d the economic agents. In this context, onemay differentiate between genuine uncertainties about the future vis-\u00e0-vis notrevealing the expected outcome of the policy.  In fact, since the 1990s, there has beena preference all over the world to improve the transparency of monetary policy.In the context of improving transparency, the recent trend has been towardsdirect inflation targeting. Adoption of explicit inflation targeting as the final goal ofmonetary policy involves the preparation of an inflation forecast, which, in a way,serves the purpose of both an intermediate target and final objective. The pre-requisites for inflation targeting include a considerable degree of operationalautonomy or independence for central bank, flexible exchange rate conditions, well-developed financial markets and absence of fiscal dominance.In view of the growing complexities of macroeconomic management, severalcentral banks including the European Central Bank have placed reliance on a broadset of economic and leading indicators rather than focusing exclusively on anintermediate target or a direct inflation target. The Federal Reserve has traditionallybeen following a more broad based approach to the conduct of monetary policy in theUS.Operating Procedures: Instruments and TargetsOperating procedures refer to the day-to-day implementation of monetarypolicy by central banks through various instruments. These instruments can be5broadly classified into direct and indirect instruments. Typically, direct instrumentsinclude required cash and/ or liquidity reserve ratios, directed credit and administeredinterest rates. Cash reserve ratio (CRR) determines the level of reserves (central bankmoney or cash) banks need to hold against their liabilities. Similarly, liquidity reserveratio requires banks to maintain a part of their liabilities in the form of liquid assets(e.g., government securities). Credit and interest rate directives take the form ofprescribed targets for allocation of credit to preferred sectors/industries andprescription of deposit and lending rates.The indirect instruments generally operate through price channel which coverrepurchase ( repos) and outright transactions in securities (open market operations),standing facilities (refinance) and market-based discount window.  For example, if thecentral bank desires to inject liquidity for a short period, it could do so by providingfunds to the banks in exchange of securities at a desired interest rate, reversing thetransaction at a pre-determined time. Similarly, if the central bank desires to influenceliquidity on an enduring basis, it could resort to open market operations (OMO),involving outright purchase (or sale) of securities.While OMO including repo transactions operate at the discretion of the centralbank, standing facilities provide limited liquidity which could be accessed by theeligible market participants (generally banks) at their discretion. Market-baseddiscount window makes available reserves either through direct lending or throughrediscounting or purchase of financial assets held by banks.In practice, the choice between direct and indirect instruments is not easy.While direct instruments are effective, they are considered inefficient in terms of theirimpact on the financial market. On the other hand, the use and efficacy of indirectinstruments depends on the extent of development of the supporting financial marketsand institutions. These instruments are usually directed at attaining a prescribed valueof the operating target. Central banks typically adopt either (a) bank reserves or (b) avery short-term interest rate (usually the overnight inter-bank rate) as the operatingtarget.The optimal choice between price and quantity targets would depend on thesources of disturbances in the goods and money markets. In reality, it often becomesdifficult to trace out the sources of instability. Hence, monetary policy is implementedby fixing, at least over some short time interval, the value of an operating target. In a6single-period context, the choice of the level of the target amounts to setting a rule formonetary policy. However, in a dynamic context, their connection is lessstraightforward.  Indeed, a deviation from a target could occur, either intended orunintended, which may impart an inflationary bias when monetary policy is conductedwith discretion. In order to address such problems of dynamic inconsistency, rule-based solutions are emphasized in literature, e.g., monetary rule (changes in moneysupply at a pre-determined rate) and Taylor-type rule (changes in interest rate basedon deviation of growth and inflation from their potential/desired levels). While a rule-based system imparts transparency, providing certainty about future policy response,it becomes ineffective in its response to unanticipated shocks given its inflexibility. Inpractice, therefore, central banks follow an approach of what has been best describedas constrained discretion.The operating procedures of monetary policy of most central banks havelargely converged to one of the following three variants: ( i) estimate the demand forbank reserves and then carry out open market operations to target short-term interestrates; (ii) estimate market liquidity and carry out open market operations to target thebank reserves, while allowing interest rates to adjust; and (iii) modulate monetaryconditions in terms of both the quantum and price of liquidity, through a mix of openmarket operations, standing facilities and minimum reserve requirement and changesin the policy rate with the objective of containing overnight market interest rate within anarrow corridor of interest rate targets.Indian SpecificsIn this backdrop, let me now turn to the conduct of monetary policy in India.What has been the objective of Indian monetary policy? The preamble to theReserve Bank of India Act, 1934 sets out the objectives of the Bank as \u201cto regulate theissue of Bank notes and the keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetarystability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the countryto its advantage\u201d. Although there is no explicit mandate for price stability, as is thecurrent trend in many countries, the objectives of monetary policy in India haveevolved as those of maintaining price stability and ensuring adequate flow of credit tothe productive sectors of the economy. In essence, monetary policy aims to maintaina judicious balance between price stability and economic growth. The relativeemphasis between price stability and economic growth is governed by the prevailing7circumstances in a particular time and is spelt out from time to time in the policyannouncements of the Reserve Bank.Of late, considerations of financial stability have assumed greater importance inview of increasing openness of the Indian economy and financial reforms. In theIndian context, financial stability could be interpreted to embrace three aspects, viz.,(a) ensuring uninterrupted financial transactions, (b) maintenance of a level ofconfidence in the financial system amongst all the participants and stakeholders, and(c) absence of excess volatility that unduly and adversely affects real economicactivity. It is the endeavour of the Reserve Bank to ensure all these aspects offinancial stability.As far as the conduct of monetary policy is concerned, it may be noted thatmonetary policy in India used to be conducted till 1997-98 with broad money (M 3) asan intermediate target. The aim was to regulate money supply consistent with twoparameters, viz., (a) the expected growth in real income, and (b) a projected level ofinflation. On the basis of estimates of these two crucial parameters, the targetedmonetary expansion could be set.  In practice, the monetary targeting framework wasused in a flexible manner with feedback from developments in the real sector.However, questions were raised about the appropriateness of such a framework withthe changing inter-relationship between money, output and prices in the wake offinancial sector reforms and opening up of the economy. The Working Group onMoney Supply (1998) sought to address some of these issues. The most significantobservation of the Group was regarding the changing nature of transmissionmechanism as it highlighted that the interest rate channel was gaining in importance.In line with this thinking, since 1998-99, the Reserve Bank has  switched overto a multiple indicator approach. As per this approach, interest rates or rates of returnin different markets (money, capital and government securities markets), along withdata such as on currency, credit extended by banks and financial institutions, fiscalposition, trade, capital flows, inflation rate, exchange rate, refinancing andtransactions in foreign exchange available on high-frequency basis, are juxtaposedwith output for drawing policy perspectives.What is the operating procedure of monetary policy in India? In the currentmonetary policy framework, with growing inter-linkages in the financial market,reliance on direct instruments has been reduced and liquidity management in the8system is carried out through OMO in the form of outright purchases/sales ofgovernment securities and daily reverse repo and repo operations under LiquidityAdjustment Facility (LAF). The LAF has enabled the Reserve Bank to modulate short-term liquidity under varied financial market conditions, including large capital inflowsfrom abroad. In addition, it has enabled the Reserve Bank to set a corridor for theshort-term interest rates consistent with the policy objectives. This has also facilitatedbringing down the CRR of banks without engendering liquidity pressure. Theseoperations are supplemented by access to the Reserve Bank\u2019s standing facilities. Inthis new operating environment, changes in reverse repo and/or the Bank Rate haveemerged as interest rate signals.There is no explicit interest rate target envisaged in India. Nevertheless, a greatdeal of reliance has been placed in recent years on interest rates and exchange ratesin the day-to-day conduct of monetary policy. In the context of increasing openness ofthe economy and a market-determined exchange rate, the large capital inflowswitnessed in recent years have posed major challenges to the conduct of monetaryand exchange rate management. A critical issue in this regard is a view on whetherthe capital flows are temporary or permanent in nature.  The recent episode of largecapital flows prompted a debate in India on the need for exchange rate adjustment. Ina scenario of uncertainty facing the monetary authorities in determining temporary orpermanent nature of inflows, it is prudent to presume that such flows are temporary tillthey are firmly established to be of permanent nature. The liquidity impact of large inflows was managed till the year 2003-04, largelythrough the day-to-day LAF and OMO. In the process, the stock of governmentsecurities available with the Reserve Bank declined progressively and the burden ofsterilization increasingly fell on LAF operations. In order to address these issues, theReserve Bank signed in March 2004, a memorandum of understanding ( MoU) with theGovernment of India for issuance of Treasury Bills and dated government securitiesunder the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS). The intention of MSS is essentially todifferentiate the liquidity absorption of a more enduring nature by way of sterilisationfrom the day-to-day normal liquidity management operations. The ceiling on theoutstanding obligations of the Government under MSS has been initially indicated butis subject to revision through mutual consultation. The issuances  under MSS arematched by an equivalent cash balance held by the Government in a separateidentifiable cash account maintained and operated by the Reserve Bank. The9operationalisation of MSS to absorb liquidity of more enduring nature has considerablyreduced the burden of sterilisation on the LAF window.In its monetary operations, the Reserve Bank uses multiple instruments toensure that appropriate liquidity is maintained in the system so that all legitimaterequirements of credit are met, consistent with the objective of price stability. Towardsthis end, the Bank pursues a policy of active management of liquidity through OMOincluding LAF, MSS and CRR, and using the policy instruments at its disposal flexibly,as and when the situation warrants.Way AheadConduct of monetary policy is complex. It has not only to be forward looking butalso to grapple with uncertain future. Additional complexities arise in the case of anemerging market like India, which is transiting from a relatively closed to aprogressively open economy.  In an environment of increasing capital flows, narrowingcross-border interest rate differentials and surplus liquidity conditions, exchange ratemovement tends to have linkages with interest rate movements. The challenge of amonetary authority is to balance the various choices into a coherent whole and toformulate a policy as an art of the possible.Let me now conclude by wishing this Conference all success.", "08 Jan 05 MP.pdf": "Investing in India: Challenges and Opportunities* SHYAMALA GOPINATH I am extremely happy to be here at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas  2005. Whether in the spirit of the traditional Ind ian culture of Vasudaiva Kutumbakam , or in the context of a globalised world, I would not like to treat the Pravasi Bharatiyas as \u2018distant\u2019, but close to both our hearts and the economy. We are, of course, very proud of the achie vements of the Indians settled abroad. It is, therefore, only befi tting that the great Indian family should meet once  a year. The topic chosen for today\u2019s discussion, viz ., finance and growth, is indeed apposite. I propos e to cover in my address the role of the RBI in maintaining an environment c onducive to investment and growth. These essentiall y relate to maintaining monetary and financial stability which can be achieved through an appropriate monetary pol icy framework, sound financial sector policies and strong external  sector. MONETARY POLICY Structural reforms in the Indian economy since the early 1990s impacted upon the various aspects of mo netary policy - its objectives, strategies and tactics. Price stabi lity and ensuring adequate credit to productive sec tors of the economy have been the twin objectives of monetary policy since I ndependence. The relative emphasis between these tw o objectives depends on the underlying economic conditions and i s spelt out from time to time. Although with the in troduction of the structural reforms, there has been a shift in the p olicy from a planned and administered interest rate  regime to a market- oriented financial system, credit availability rema ins an important objective of monetary policy in In dia. At the same time, with the opening up of the econom y since the early 1990s, financial stability has no w emerged as a key consideration in the conduct of monetary policy . Monetary management has now to contend with vicis situdes of capital flows and the resultant volatility in exchange rate s. A related difficulty is that whereas the distinc tion between short term and long term flows is conceptually clear, in pract ice, however, it is not always easy to distinguish between the two for operational purposes. Moreover, at any given time, some flows could be of an enduring nature whereas o thers could be temporary and, hence, reversible. More importantly,  what appears to be short-term could tend to last l onger and vice versa ,imparting a dynamic dimension to judgment about the ir relative composition? In a scenario of uncertain ty facing the authorities in determining temporary or permanent n ature of inflows, it is prudent to presume that suc h flows are temporary till such time that they are firmly established to be of a permanent nature. The instruments and opera ting procedures of monetary policy have, therefore, to be constantly r efined to meet the challenges thrown up by such cap ital flows and a market-determined exchange rate. This necessitated a complete recast of the monetary policy operating procedure by moving away from statutory preemptions and direct c ontrols to an array of indirect instruments to modu late liquidity conditions in tune with the process of price discov ery. The Reserve Bank is now able to influence the quantum of liquidity through a policy mix of open market (including repo ) operations alongside changes in reserve requireme nts and standing facilities, reinforced by interest rate signals, th rough changes in the policy rates which impact the price of primary liquidity. Illustratively, in India, existing arrangements to modulate liquidity had to be supplemented with inno vations such as the Market Stabilisation Scheme. BANKING SECTOR REFORMS As the economy grows and becomes more sophisticated , the banking sector has to develop pari passu in a manner so that it supports and stimulates such growth. With i ncreasing global integration, the Indian banking sy stem and financial system as a whole had to be strengthened so as to b e able to compete. Until the beginning of the 1990s, the state of the financial sector in India could be described as a c lassic example of \u201cfinancial repression\u201d, a la  MacKinnon and Shaw. While the true health of finan cial intermediaries, most of them public sector entities, was masked by relatively opaque ac counting norms and limited disclosure, there were g eneral concerns about their viability. Scant attention was placed o n the financial health of the intermediaries. Their  capitalisation levels were low. The lack of commercial considerations in credi t planning and weak recovery culture resulted in a large accumulation of non-performing loans. Starting from such a position, it is widely recogni sed that the Indian financial sector over the last decade has been transformed into a reasonably sophisticated, divers e and resilient system. However, this transformatio n has been the culmination of extensive, well-sequenced and coordi nated policy measures aimed at making the Indian fi nancial sector efficient, competitive and stable. These measures c overed prudential, competition enhancing institutio nal and legal and supervisory measures. An important feature of the move towards globalisat ion of the Indian financial system has been the int ent of the authorities to move towards international best prac tices. This is illustrated by the appointment of se veral advisory groups designed to benchmark Indian practices with interna tional standards in several crucial areas of import ance like monetary policy, banking supervision, data dissemination, co rporate governance and the like. Towards this end, a Standing Committee on International Financial Standards and Codes (Chairman: Dr. Y. V. Reddy) was constituted a nd the recommendations contained therein have either been implemented or are in the process of implementation . The RBI has recently prepared a Report that reviews the progres s, provides the current status on the implementatio n and captures new developments in the field of international financia l standards and codes. EXTERNAL SECTOR MANAGEMENT The overall objective of external sector reforms wa s to achieve higher growth and efficiency without e xposing the system to greater vulnerability. The position of th e external sector today is in marked contrast to th e balance of payments crisis of 1991, when default was perceived as a rea l threat. As is well known even in these circumstan ces India did not default on any of its obligations and maintained it s excellent track record of debt service. At that t ime reserves were down to less than US$ 1 billion and external debt was ar ound US$ 85 billion as against the current position  where reserves are more than external debt. We Indians can be proud of  the fact that even during the worst currency crisi s India did not reschedule, roll over or default on its obligations  which is unparalleled. The process of opening up the Indian economy has pr oceeded in steady steps. \uf06c/uniF020First, the exchange rate regime was allowed to be determined by market forces as agains t the fixed exchange rate linked to a basket of cur rencies. \uf06c/uniF020Second, this was followed by the convertibility of the Indi an rupee for current account transactions with Indi a accepting the obligations under Article VIII of the IMF in August  1994. \uf06c/uniF020Third, capital account convertibility has proceeded  at a steady pace. We view it as a process rather than as an eve nt. At present, the de facto  full capital account convertibility for non- residents is supported by the calibrated liberalisa tion of transactions undertaken for capital account  purposes in the case of residents. \uf06c/uniF020Fourth, the distinct improvement in the external se ctor has enabled a progressive liberalisation of th e exchange and payments regime in India. Reflecting the change d approach to foreign exchange restrictions, the re strictive Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA), 1973 has been repla ced by the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999. It may not be entirely an issue of semantics that the \u2018Exchange Control Department\u2019 of the RBI has been r echristened as \u2018Foreign Exchange Department\u2019. WHAT HAVE WE ACHIEVED? How did these measures get translated into tangible  economic results? While assessing the conduct of p olicies in recent years, one needs to take cognisance of the f act that the Indian economy witnessed a large numbe r of shocks, both global and domestic. These shocks included a series  of financial crises in Asia, Brazil and Russia bes ides September 11 terrorist attacks in the US, border tensions, sanct ions imposed in the aftermath of nuclear tests and political uncertainties. From the vantage point of 2005, it seems that our s trategy worked and worked reasonably well. There was a sharp fall in the average inflation rat e to 5.8 per cent during 1994-95 to 2003-04, which is far below the long-run average of about 8.0 per cent during the 1 970s-90s. While year-to-year inflation may vary dep ending upon the intensity of supply shocks, monetary policy can sta bilise inflation expectations at low levels. It is necessary to underscore that the moderation in inflation has been wrought i n an atmosphere of multiple challenges. \u2022 First of all, there have been a number of supply s hocks, including the major drought of 2002-03. It i s a measure of the improvement in supply management over the years tha t the inflation rate, at 3.4 per cent during 2002-0 3, was far lower than 8.1 per cent in 1987-88, the last drought year . Food article prices were, in fact, only marginall y higher at 1.8 per cent than 9.0 per cent of 1987-88. \u2022 Secondly, it must be understood that large capital  flows, although an indicator of investor confidenc e, also pose challenges for price stability. The Reserve Bank ha s been able to put in a carefully crafted monetary policy strategy to maintain orderly conditions in the financial market s, on the one hand and to ensure price stability on  the other. \u2022 Finally, it is necessary to appreciate that inflat ionary expectations in the economy are also coming down. What had been the impact on the banking sector? The  banking sector had been able to withstand various shocks and provided the foundation for a safe and sound financ ial infrastructure. Among various indicators, let m e highlight three basic indicators: \u2022 There has been a significant improvement in the ca pital position of the banking system. As at end-Mar ch 2004 scheduled commercial banks had a capital to risk-we ighted asset ratio (CRAR) of 12.9 percent. \u2022 Net non-performing assets of the banking system ha ve come down (as percentage of net advances) to 2.9  per cent by March 2004 from 8.1 per cent in 1996-97. \u2022 Despite the fact that banks were required to follo w income recognition and provisioning norms and tha t there was intensification of competition, the profitability o f the banking system has improved to over 1.0 per c ent of total assets since March 2003 from 0.2 per cent as at end-March 1996. No discussion on the achievement of financial secto r reforms is complete without a discussion on finan cial stability in Indian context. Following Governor Reddy, financial  stability in the Indian context could be interpret ed to embrace: (a) ensuring uninterrupted financial transactions, (b) maintenance of a level of confidence in the financi al system amongst all the participants and stakeholders, and (c) absence of excess volatility that unduly and adversely affe cts real economic activity. 1 The stability of the Indian financial system has b een tested on certain occasions and the financial s ystem has proved its resilience. The management of the external sector is seen as an other success story. Before I delve into the detail s of the impact of reform in external sector, consider the followin g broad indicators: \u2022 The current account deficit contracted to an avera ge of only 0.6 per cent of GDP during 1994-95 to 20 03-04 from 1.8 per cent in the 1980s. It, in fact, recorded a surp lus since 2001-02 after a period of 23 years. \u2022 Key indicators of debt sustainability point to the  continuing consolidation and improved solvency in the 1990s. The external debt to GDP ratio declined sharply from 38 .7 per cent at end-March 1992 to 17.6 per cent at e nd-March 2004. \u2022 The present Indian regime of market determined exc hange rate and focusing on managing volatility with out any fixed target has served India well. In line with the poli cy preference, we have emphasised the need for non- debt flows rather than debt flows in our capital account during the 1 990s. \u2022 We now have foreign exchange reserves of over US$ 130 billion, which is the sixth largest in the worl d, which is a far cry from the situation of August 1991 when foreign exchange reserves dwindled to US$ 0.8 billion. Our foreign exchange reserves are, in fact, larger than our ext ernal debt. It is now well recognised that the Indian approach to exchange rate management with a focus on managin g volatility has stood the test of time. The Indian approach to exchange rate management has been even described as  an ideal for Asia. 1Reddy, Y. V (2004): \u201cFinancial Stability: Indian Ex perience\u201d, Lecture at Zurich University, Zurich, Sw itzerland,RBI Bulletin , July.The merits of our cautious approach to capital acco unt convertibility are now well appreciated. Gradua lism in liberalisation implies that the mix between control led, regulated and liberalised capital transactions  keeps changing gradually in favour of the latter. We did not have to reverse policies towards the capital account as was the case with some emerging market economies that had followed a relat ively rapid liberalisation without entrenching the necessary preconditions. We have repeatedly emphasised that o ur approach to capital account convertibility is a process rather than an event, contingent on achieving certain precondit ions related to health and strength of the financia l sector, sustainability in the fiscal sector and containment of inflation. Over the years, the policy regime in regard to capi tal account inflows and outflows in India has witnessed a significant liber alisation. There are, however, two areas where extr eme caution continues to be exercised, viz ., (i) unlimited access to short-term external comm ercial borrowing; and (ii) providing unrestricted freedom to domestic residents to convert their dome stic bank deposits and idle assets (such as, real e state). AVENUES FOR INVESTMENT IN INDIA Having talked of the success story of reforms let m e now turn to the avenues of investment in India. S everal such options are available, depending on the risk and re turn profile of the investment in mind. Instead of providing a shopping list, let me give a quick rundown of the menu avail able. One of the oldest avenues is the NRI deposit.  Since the early 1970s, when the Non-Resident (Exter nal) Deposit Scheme was introduced, the Reserve Bank has offered  various facilities for non-resident Indians in the  form of deposit schemes. Since the 1990s, the Reserve Bank\u2019s policy  in this regard has been aimed at attracting a stab le pool of NRI deposits for providing a support to balance of paym ents. NRI deposits, at US$ 33.3 billion as at end-M arch 2004, emerged as a major source of capital inflows during the 199 0s. Apart from the size, the success of the policy is also reflected in an increase in the proportion of local currency denomi nated deposits from around one-fourth in 1991 to al most two-third by 2002. This has been accompanied by a rationalisatio n of interest rates on rupee-denominated NRI deposi ts. This apart, we are now linking interest rates on foreign currency denominated deposits to LIBOR. The Reserve Bank has  been de- emphasising short-term (up to 12 months) foreign cu rrency denominated deposits in view of its attendan t implications. These measures have been counterbalanced by several  incentives to accord NRIs operational flexibility.  Funds of US$ one million can be remitted through authorised dealers after payment of taxes subject to certain limits in  case of property. Authorised dealers (ADs) are now permitted to grant  rupee loans to NRIs. Earlier, housing loans availe d by NRIs/Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) could be repaid by borrower s either by way of inward remittances through norma l banking channels or by debit to NRE/ FCNR(B)/NRO/NRNR/NRSR accounts or out of rental incomes derived from the property.  Since May 2004, borrowers\u2019 close relatives in India are allow ed to repay the instalment of such loans, interest and other charges directly to the concerned ADs/ housing finance inst itutions through their bank accounts. A second avenue is foreign portfolio investment. We  now provide an operating environment which is now much more congenial because of procedural changes for investm ent and facilities for investment in equity securit ies as well as in debt securities. NRIs and PIOs are also permitted to inv est in shares and debentures of Indian companies, g overnment securities, commercial papers, company deposits and  mutual funds. An NRI is permitted to purchase/sell  shares and/or convertible debentures of an Indian company through  a registered broker on a recognised stock exchange  provided his/her transactions are routed through designated branch o f an AD in India subject to prescribed limits. Alth ough the aggregate paid-up value of shares of the company purchased by  NRIs should not exceed 10 per cent of the total pa id-up capital and convertible debentures, respectively, the ceiling c an be raised to 24 per cent if a Special Resolution  to that effect is passed by the concerned company. NRIs are allowed to inves t in exchange traded derivative contracts approved by the SEBI out of rupee funds held in India on a non-repatriable b asis. Yet another avenue is foreign direct investment. It  will be recalled that a major policy thrust toward s attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) was outlined in the New Ind ustrial Policy Statement of 1991. Since then, conti nuous efforts have been made to liberalise and simplify the norms and procedures pertaining to FDI. At present, FDI is pe rmitted under the automatic route subject to specific guidelines exce pt for a small negative list. To put this in perspe ctive, let me mention the so-called negative list: \uf06c/uniF020There are just six 2 sectors where investments are prohibited. There ar e twelve 3 sectors where investments require prior approval of the Governmen t. \uf06c/uniF020Further, under the automatic route, investments onl y in six 4sectors are subject to sectoral caps. Until recently, acquisition of shares from resident s by non-residents through private arrangement requ ired Government approval. Such acquisition of shares, except in fin ancial services sector, by private arrangement no l onger requires Government approval. This implies that FDI is virtu ally welcome in a number of sectors without any pri or approval. Non- residents are permitted to enter into forward sale contracts with ADs in India to hedge the currency r isk arising out of their proposed FDI in India. Non-resident shareholders we re allowed to apply for issue of additional equity shares or preference shares or convertible debentures over and above the ir rights entitlements. Allotment is subject to the  condition that the overall issue of shares to non-residents in the tot al paid-up capital of the company does not exceed t he sectoral cap. FDI by NRIs, however, continues to be negligible. So far I have not mentioned about the role of remit tances. During 2003-04, remittances amounted to aro und US$ 22.8 billion. In fact, of the Asian countries, apart fro m India it is only the Philippines that is receivin g remittances in excess of 3 per cent of GDP. I compliment the Indian Diaspora f or being such a source of resilience to the Indian economy. This apart, in view of demographic challenge facing the Western  countries, remittances have an additional dimensio n. To the extent that they are essentially in the nature of family m aintenance transfers they are surely funding a non- trivial population of the aged. For the recipient countries, remittances have  the potential of reducing the pressure of dependen cy ratios and increasing growth. It is also good for the remittin g countries, facing the old-age challenge, through augmentation of their work force. CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS India has come a long way from the days of crisis o f the early 1990s. Our pragmatic and gradual approa ch to reform seemed to have paid reasonably well. We emerged alm ost unscathed from various crises like East Asian c risis, drought or sanction-like situation. While I am not being compl acent, there are reasons to believe that India woul d be on a higher growth trajectory in the coming decades. This is ec hoed in the assessment of international agencies as  well. What are the opportunities and challenges? There ar e business opportunities in the traditional sector \u2013 such as power generation and roadways \u2013 as well as in the sunrise  sector \u2013 such as information technology. The Tenth  Five Year Plan targets, among others, agriculture, and constructio n for high growth in view of their potential for em ployment generation with relatively low capital intensity. It also plan s to fill the existing shortfalls in investment in power generation and communication by a significant improvement in priva te investment, and by removing fiscal constraints a s well as generation of internal resources by the public sector. There i s a particular accent on developing infrastructure which is often recognised as a major constraint on growth. Power s ector reforms are energising power generation to me et the rising demand for electricity. The aggregate of remittances and non-resident depos its is quite significant. We now look for greater c ontribution in this national metamorphosis for mutual benefit. There is  no doubt that the emergence of the Indian economy on a high growth path provides ample scope for the entrepreneurial a bilities of the NRIs. It is only appropriate to con clude that this session will be very fruitful in discussing investment oppo rtunities available in the Indian economy. 2These are: Retail trading, atomic energy, lottery b usiness, gambling and betting, housing and real est ate business and agriculture (excluding floriculture, h orticulture, development of seeds, animal husbandry ,pisiculture and cultivation of vegetables) and plan tations (excluding tea plantations).3These are: Domestic airlines, petroleum sector, inv esting companies in infrastructure and services sec tor,defence and strategic industries, atomic minerals, print media, broadcasting, postal services, courier  services,establishment and operation of satellite, developme nt of integrated township and tea sector.4These are: Private sector banking, insurance, telec ommunications, trading, exploration and mining of d iamonds and precious stones and airports.* Keynote Address by Smt.

My presentation will initially provide a broad overview of the global developments and then move on to briefly list the aspects of market and regulatory failures which characterised the recent developments. I will then lay down the broad contours of the financial sector policies in India,  with the details of a few specific initiatives relevant to financial stability. The concluding remarks will be in the nature of a few broad issues for further debate.   I. Global Financial Markets Recent Developments While the trigger for the global developments in the financial markets during the recent past was the rising default rates on sub-prime mortgages in the US, the source of the problem was perhaps not the macro-global imbalances but significant mispricing of risks in the financial system. Easy monetary pol icy in major financial centres, globalisation of liquidity flows, wide-spread use of highly complex structured debt instruments and the inadequacy of banking supervision in coping with financial innovations, contributed to the severity of the crisis. The persistent under pricing of risks was suspected by several central banks for quite some time, but it was felt by many that these risks were widely dispersed through financial innovation and that they would not pose any serious problems to the banking system. When the sub-prime crisis  did occur, however, it triggered a wide contagion affecting many of the large global financial institutions. Banks, in particular, appear to have ceased to trust each other\u2019s creditworthiness leading to difficulties in the money markets in the US, Europe and the UK resulting in drying up of liquidity, since each financial institution attempted to shore up its own liquidity to meet its obligations. The problems of maturity mismatch in the c onduits or structured investment vehicles (SIVs) created by the banks for purposes of securitisation manifested themselves in a                                              1  Address by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India, at the Meeting of the Task Force on Financial Markets Regulation organized by the Initiative for Policy Dialogue at Manchester, United Kingdom, on July 1, 2008.  2sudden spurt in demand for liquidity from banks to meet their liquidity support obligations to the SIVs or to fund the assets of the SIVs that were taken on to their balance sheets. It is now realised that the relevant banks have leveraged excessively and had not fully recognised the risks or had seriously underpriced them, thus warranting large capital infusion. Uncertainty about the possible losses yet to be disclosed by several of them has not yet ceased.   These developments have brought forward several new realities that pose severe challenges to macro-economic management, in particular to monetary and regulatory policies globally. First, concerns relating to the US slowdown and its intensity have mounted in view of the potential spill over on to the global economy. Second, threats to the global economy are emanating from advanc ed economies in sharp contrast to earlier crises which stemmed from the emerging wo rld. Third, there are indications that protectionist tendencies have increased around the world in anticipation of the growing possibilities of slower growth in advanced economies. Fourth, linkages between financial sector developments and the real sector have become more worrisome than before, with apprehensions that financial turmoil may spill over to the real sector with adverse implications for employment and growth. With tightening in lending standards, deterioration in asset quality and deceleration in consumer loan demand, there are indications that events in the financial markets are beginning to have a persisting impact on the real economy as well. Fifth, higher and more volatile prices of food, energy and other commodities have compounded the problem , causing a significant upside bias to inflation and inflation expectations across the world, complicating the conduct of monetary policy at a time of severe financial stress. Further, while rising energy prices may be an exogenous shock for several countries, for the global economy as a whole it is endogenous. Sixth, terms-of-trade losses due to soaring commodity prices not only reduce the capacity of a re-balancing of the world economy but also impact several countries in different ways but essentially in an adverse fashion. In fact, it is possible that new global economic imbalances are emerging on account of large movements in commodity prices, especially oil. Sevent h, Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) are exhibiting resilience until now in the face of t he global financial turmoil reflecting relatively stronger macroeconomic framework and sustainable macroeconomic balances. However, until how long and to what extent it will persist is uncertain. On the other hand, inflationary pressures appear to be common to mature economies and EMEs but the latter are under greater stress.    3The central banks in major countries have had to take recourse, in appropriate mix, to three instruments to avoid serious spill-over of these issues in money or credit markets into the wider economy: (i) adjustment of interest rates for borrowing and lending; (ii) money market operations designed to inject special liquidity in order to avoid a break-down in payment systems among banks, and (iii) to put in mechanisms for financial transactions among the largest of the financial intermediaries which automatically impact the second and third rung intermediaries. Central banks in major industrialised economies, by and large, responded with injection of liquidity for a longer period than is usually done; they also resorted to dilution in the quality of collateral required for liquidity support. Most of these operations have not been conducted at the penal rates expected in such situations. This is an unprecedented package which, some observers believe, is indicative of the seriousness of the underlying problems. In addition, there were some specific-institution oriented operations, namely, in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. While there have been inflationary pressures in most economies, the USA has been faced with a th reat of serious slowdown in growth warranting a series of cuts in policy rates in recent months.  In recent weeks, concerns over inflationary pressures globally have taken the centre-stage even while there are no indications as to whether threats to financial stability have been fully resolved and whether persistent threats of recession in USA have abated. Consequently, the policy dilemmas have become more acute at the current juncture. The most urgent and short-term priority for central bankers at the current juncture seems to be to calm the nerves about inflation or to anc hor inflation expectations, with an implicit recognition that a somewhat elevated headline inflation in the short-term may be difficult to avoid. Further, high inflation rates when acco mpanied by higher variability of inflation, raises greater uncertainties. These acute policy dilemmas at the current juncture between growth and inflation have to be faced in the background of financial turbulence which is yet to calm down. There are also calls for fundamental re-think on macro-economic, monetary and financial sector policies to meet  the new challenges and realities, which perhaps represent a structural shift in the international financial architecture demanding potentially enhanced degree of coordination among monetary authorities and regulators. A review of the policies relating to financial regulation, in a way, needs to address both the acute policy dilemmas in the short run and a fundamental re-think on broader frameworks of financial and economic policies over the medium-term.     4Market Failures What are some of the identifiable sources of market failures that led to the current financial turbulence?  First, the prolonged benign macroeconomic conditions gave rise to complacency among many market participants and led to an erosion of sound practices, resulting in adoption of poor credit risk appraisal standards.  Second, some of the standard risk management tools and models used by market participants were not equipped to estimate th e potential impact of adverse events for structured credit products and high uncerta inty around model estimates that largely missed the underlying combination of risks. Fu rther, these risk models, generally tended to induce the market participants to adopt a unidirectional approach.  Third, many investors, including institutional ones, with the capacity to undertake their own credit analysis, did not undertake sufficient in-house examination of the risks in the assets underlying structured investments.  Fourth , the role of credit rating agencies (CRAs) in the recent market developments has attracted attention.  Fifth, the distortions in incentive structures can be seen from various perspectives namely  incentives for originators, arranger s, distributors and managers in the originate-to-distribute model; the compensation schemes in financial institutions not distinguishing between realised and unrealised profits; encouraging financial structures tailored to obtaining high ratings etc. Sixth, weaknesses in public disclosures by financial institutions on the type and magnitude of risks associated with their on- and off-balance sheet exposures are noticeable.   Seventh, large commercial banks and investment banks have assumed increasingly similar risk profiles, use sim ilar models to assess and are subject to the same risk-management challenges under the given circumstances.  Eighth, there is a new dimension to bank liquidity, with the shifting emphasis to a market based wholesale or purchased liabilities. This makes banks increasingly dependent on the market for raising liquidity, while markets may have a tendency to shy away from providing liquidity  when they are most needed.   Regulatory Shortcomings While the foregoing brings out the failures of the markets and of the market participants, some of the regulatory shor tcomings identified are as follows.    5First, the regulators recognised some of  the underlying vulnerabilities in the financial sector but failed to take effective action, partly because they may have overestimated the strength and resilience of the financial system or they assumed that the risks were well distributed among entities outside the banking system. Many analysts and policymakers had raised concerns about ex cessive risk taking, loose underwriting standards, and asset overvaluations, all of which have in the absence of timely effective actions laid the seeds for crises.  Second, the limitations in regulatory ar rangements, including the capital adequacy framework, contributed to the growth of unregulated exposures, excessive risk-taking and weak liquidity risk management.  Third, weaknesses in the application of accounting standards and the shortcomings associated with the valuati on and financial reporting of structured products played a significant role in the current tur bulence through pro-cyclical valuations and lack of full disclosure of banks\u2019 true risk profile through the cycle.  Fourth, the crisis revealed the need to adapt some of the tools and practices of central banks to manage system liquidity in the light of banks\u2019 cross-border operations. The recent experiences have highlighted the differences in emergency liquidity frameworks of central banks, on aspects such as range of collateral, range of eligible counterparties; and the differences in central bank practices.  Fifth, supervisors did not adequately address deterioration in risk management standards in the regulated entities, which did not fully reckon the risks associated with new financial instruments, and there were s hortcomings in consolidated supervision.  Sixth, deficiencies in crisis management and bank resolution frameworks, including deposit insurance,  have been observed, especially where central banks do not have a central supervisory role.  Seventh, the complex inter-relationship between regulation, the inappropriate accounting practices, and regulators\u2019 excessive dependence on external ratings may have exacerbated the market turbulence.   Menu of Solutions The above underlying factors clearly demonstrate a need to enhance the resilience of the global system and consider some of the prescriptions that have been proffered for the consideration of the policy makers. The recent developments in the global financial markets have been closely followed by many. These include market  6participants, central bankers, supervisors, multilateral institutions, political leaders, analysts, academicians, and also the layman. With so much attention being focused on the ongoing turbulence, by so many stakeholders, we have a wide menu of solutions and prescriptions. I will quickly run-through some of these.  First, risk management framew orks including the gover nance arrangements in banks and financial institutions need to be reviewed by the managements in the light of the recent experiences.  Second, supervisors need to play a more active role in scrutinizing the risk management practices, including stress testing and governance arrangements, off balance sheet entities and structured products.. At the same time, it is crucial to recognize that risk management cannot be achieved solely by regulation.  Consolidated supervision and prudential reporting should be applied to off balance sheet entities associated with financial institutions and to loans sold with implicit or explicit recourse. There is a need to review the prudential norms linked to external ratings assigned by the CRAs.  Third, supervisors should encourage institutions to develop more robust models which use more prudent and reliable assumptions and stress testing methodologies; and monitor more closely the internal processes, and controls for managing risk.  Fourth, there is a need to rationalise the regulatory and supervisory prescriptions with a view to reducing the scope for arbitraging.  This also calls for closer coordination of the relevant supervisors/ supervisory arms.  Fifth, it is necessary to correct the imbalances in the incentive mechanisms at various levels.  Sixth, greater transparency is not only necessary to make the markets more efficient and to optimise the allocation of capital, but it is also considered to be the best insurance policy against irrational herd behaviour and unjustified contagion in times of stress.  Seventh, there is a need to collectively review and resolve the element of pro-cyclicality in prudential regulations, accounting rules, and the attitude of the authorities that tend to apply these.  Eighth, it is necessary for the CRAs to improve their governance and rating methodologies.   7Ninth, arguably it is useful to re-visit the relevant accounting standards and explore the scope for applying fair value accounting through the cycle so as to mitigate pro-cyclicality.  Tenth, supervisors should have clear authority to intervene at the first sign of weakness, preferably much before the institution\u2019s net worth turns negative.  Finally, deposit insurance systems should aim to limit the likelihood of retail depositor runs in troubled banks through adequate coverage, and have the capacity to pay depositors quickly.  II. Indian Experience Ensuring Financial Stability In contrast to the above global scenario, India has by-and-large been spared of global financial contagion due to the sub-prime turmoil for a variety of reasons. The credit derivatives market is in an embryonic stage; t he originate-to-distribute model in India is not comparable to the ones prevailing in advanced markets; there are restrictions on investments by resident in such products issued abroad; and regulatory guidelines on securitisation do not permit immediate profit  recognition. Financial stability in India has been achieved through perseverance of prudential policies which prevent institutions from excessive risk taking, and financial market s from becoming extremely volatile and turbulent. As a result, while there are orderly conditions in financial markets, the financial institutions, especially banks, reflect strength and resilience. While supervision is exercised by a quasi-independent Board carved out of the RBI Board, the interface between regulation and supervision is close in respect of banks and financial institutions, and on market regulation, a close coordination with other regulators exists. Let me recount this experience which, in some ways, reflects a policy that aimed to assure financial stability while maintaining growth momentum at reasonable levels and giving a high priority to price stability. Investment Portfolio In the year 2000 the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) conducted a stress test of the banks\u2019 investment portfolio in an increasing interest rate scenario, when the general trend then was decreasing interest rates. At that time, banks in India were maintaining a surrogate capital charge for market risk, which was at a variance from the Basel norms. On the basis of the findings, in order to equip the banking system to be better positioned to meet the adverse impact of interest rate risk, banks were advised in January 2002 to build up an Investment Fluctuation Reserve (IFR) within a period of five years. The prudential target for the IFR was 5 per cent of their investments in \u2018Held for Trading\u2019  8(HFT) and \u2018Available for Sale\u2019 (AFS) categories. Banks were encouraged to build up a higher percentage of IFR up to 10 per cent of their AFS and HFT investments. This counter-cyclical prudential requirement enabled banks to absorb some of the adverse impact when interest rates began moving in the opposite direction in late 2004. Banks have been maintaining capital charge for market risk as envisaged under the Basel norms since end-March 2006. The regulatory guidelines in India require banks to classify their investments in three categories, similar to the international standards. The investments included in the Held to Maturity (HTM) category was capped at 25 per cent of the total investments and banks are allowed to carry the investments in the HTM category at cost, subject amortisation of premium, if any. With the change in the direction of the movement of interest rates in 2004, the cap on the HTM category was reviewed in the light of the statutory prescriptions (referred to as statut ory liquidity ratio (SLR) in India) requiring banks to mandatorily invest up to 25 per cent of their Demand and Time Liabilities (DTL) in eligible government securities. In view of the statutory pre-emption and the long duration of the government securities, banks were permitted to exceed the limit of 25 per cent of total investments under Held to Ma turity (HTM) category provided the excess comprised only of the SLR securities, and the total SLR securities held in the HTM category was not more than 25 per cent of their DTL. Such shifting was allowed at acquisition cost or book value or market val ue on the date of transfer, whichever is the least, and the depreciation, if any, on such transfer was required to be fully provided for. The above transition is consistent with inte rnational standards that do not place any cap on HTM category, and was considered advisable taking into account the statutory nature of the SLR while ensuring prudence and transparency in valuation on transfer to HTM category. While the earlier prescription for this  category was relatively more conservative, the changes in September 2004 recognised the dynamic interface with the interest rate cycles and were counter-cyclical.  Capital Adequacy \u2013 Risk Weights In view of the increase in growth of advances to the real estate sector, banks were advised to put in place a proper risk management system to contain the risks involved. Banks were also advised to put in place a system for ensuring proper checking and documentation of related papers before sanctioning / disbursing of such loans. In June 2005, the RBI advised banks to have a board mandated policy in respect of their real estate exposure covering exposure limits, collaterals to be considered, margins to be kept, sanctioning authority/level and sector to be financed. In view of the rapid increase in loans to the real estate sector raising concerns about asset quality and the potential  9systemic risks posed by such exposure, the risk weight on banks' exposure to commercial real estate was increased from 100 per cent to 125 per cent in July 2005 and further to 150 per cent in April 2006. The risk weights on housing loans extended by banks to individuals against mortgage of housing properties and investments in mortgage backed securities (MBS) of housing fi nance companies (HFCs), recognised and supervised by National Housing Bank (NHB) we re increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent in December 2004. However, on a review, banks were advised to reduce the risk weight in respect of exposures arising out of housing loans up to Rs.30 lakh (USD 75,000 approx) to individuals against the mortgage of residential housing properties from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, in view of the lower perception of risks in these exposures.  In the light of the strong growth of consumer credit and the volatility in the capital markets, it was felt that the quality of lending could suffer during the phase of rapid expansion. Hence, as a counter cyclical measure, we increased the risk weight for consumer credit and capital market exposur es from 100 per cent to 125 per cent. Provisions against Standard Assets The prudential norms relating to income recognition, asset classification and provisioning, introduced during 1992-93 are bei ng continuously monitored and refined to bring them on par with international best prac tices. In keeping with this, several measures were initiated in 2005-06. The provisions for standard assets were revised progressively in November 2005, May 2006 and January 2007, in stages in view of t he continued high credit growth in the real estate sector, pers onal loans, credit card receivables, and loans and advances qualifying as capital market exposure and a higher default rate with regard to personal loans and credit card receivables, which emerged as a matter of concern. The standard assets in the following categories of loans and advances attract a two per cent provisioning requirement (i) personal loans (including credit card receivables); (ii) loans and advances qualifying as capital market expo sure; (iii) real estate loans (excluding residential housing loans), and (iv) loans and advances to systemically important non-deposit accepting non-banking finance compani es (NBFC-ND-SI). In order to ensure continued and adequate availability of credit to the highly productive sectors of the economy, the provisioning requirement for al l other loans and advances, classified as standard assets was kept unchanged, viz., (i) direct advances to the agricultural and SME sectors at 0.25 per cent; and (ii) all other loans and advances at 0.4 per cent.      10Exposure to Inter-Bank Liability In order to reduce the extent of concentration of bank\u2019s liabilities the RBI had issued guidelines to banks in March 2007 placing prudential limits on the extent of their Inter-Bank Liability (IBL) as a proportion of their networth (200%). Those banks which had a higher capital adequacy ratio of 125% of the regulatory minimum were allowed a higher limit of 300% of networth. In addition, prudential limits have also been placed on the extent to which banks may access the inter-bank call money market both as a lender and as a borrower.   Financial Regulation of Systemically Important NBFCs and Banks\u2019 Relationship with Them The RBI has been strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework for non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) since 1997 with the objective of making the NBFC sector vibrant and healthy. The focus was initially on deposit-taking NBFCs. These efforts were pursued further during 2006-07, when a major thrust was on strengthening the regulatory framework with regard to systemically important non-banking financial companies so as to reduce the regulatory gaps. At that time, the regulatory focus was also widened to include systemically important non-deposit taking NBFCs and prudential norms were specified for these entities.  The application of different levels of regulations to the activities of banks and NBFCs, and even among different categories of NBFCs, had given rise to some issues relating to uneven coverage of regulations. Based on the recommendations of an Internal Group and taking into consideration the feedback received thereon, a revised framework to add ress the issues pertaining to the overall regulation of systemically important NB FCs and the relationship between banks and NBFCs was put in place in December 2006.  Securitisation guidelines The RBI has issued guidelines on securitisation of standard assets in February 2006. The guidelines are applicable to banks and financial institutions, including non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). These guidelines provide for a conservative treatment of securitisation exposures for capital adequacy purposes, especially in regard to the credit enhancement and liquidity facilities. The regulatory framework encourages greater participation by third parties with a view to ensure better governance in the structuring of special purpose vehicles (SPVs), the products, and the provision of support facilities. A unique feature of these guidelines, which may be at a variance with the accounting standards, is that any profits on sale of assets to the SPV are not allowed to be recognised immediately on sale but over the life of the pass through certificates issued  11by the SPV. We believe that these guidelines, as a package, have ensured an appropriate incentive mechanism for securitisation transactions.  Banks\u2019 Investment in Non-SLR Securities RBI had emphasised that banks should obs erve prudence in order to contain the risk arising out of their non-SLR (i.e., non government) investment portfolio, in particular through the private placement route. Detailed prudential guidelines on the subject were issued in June 2001, which were reviewed and revised in November 2003. These guidelines, inter alia, address aspects of coverage, regulatory requirements, listing and rating requirements, fixing of prudential limits , internal assessments, role of Boards, disclosures, and trading and settlement in debt securities. Banks were specifically advised that they should not be solely guided by the ratings assigned to these securities by the external rating agencies but that they should do a detailed appraisal as in the case of direct lending.  Marking-to-market The Indian accounting standards are generally aligned to the International Financial Reporting Standards, though there are some differences. In India, we are yet to fully adopt the marking-to-market requirements as available in the international standards. The Indian standards are relatively conservative and do not permit recognition of unrealised gains in the profit and loss account or equity, though unrealised losses are required to be accounted. Banks are required to  mark-to-market the investments in the Held for Trading (HFT) and Available for Sale (AFS) categories at periodical intervals, on a portfolio basis, and provide for the net losses and ignore the net gains. This has proved to be a stabilising factor, inasmuch as it has not induced an imbalance in the incentive structures and has also proved to be less pro-cyclical.   Moral Suasion and Supervisory Review Moral suasion and public articulation of concerns has helped in achieving a desired re-balancing of suspected excesses in risk-taking among banks. Some of the areas where moral suasion has been used are the need for banks to monitor unhedged foreign currency exposures of their corporate clients, adoption of appropriate incentive mechanisms by banks for encouraging disclosures of derivative exposures by their corporate clients, banks\u2019 reliance on non-deposit resources to finance assets, their excessive reliance on wholesale deposits and uncomfortable loan-to-value (LTV) ratios in respect of housing loans etc.   12A supervisory review process (SRP) was initiated with select banks having significant exposure to sensitive sectors, including reliance on call money market, in order to ensure that effective risk mitigants and sound internal control systems are in place. In the first round, a framework was developed for monitoring the systemically important individual banks. The second round of SRP was directed to analyse banks\u2019 exposure to sensitive sectors and identify outliers. Based on the analyses of these outlier banks, guidelines were issued to all banks indicating the need for better risk management systems in banks at operating levels.  In brief, in India the  focus is on regulatory comfort, going beyond regulatory compliance. In a choice between emphasis of  regulations on saving capital and protecting depositors\u2019 interests or reinforcing financial system stability, the latter have always prevailed.  III. Indian Experience of Financial Sector Liberalisation and Development  It is necessary to clarify that while t he measures mentioned above are aimed at fostering financial stability, in order to enhance efficiency several other initiatives have been taken to liberalise the macro-policy environment in which banks operate through a re-orientation of regulatory prescriptions by replacing micro regulations with macro-prudential regulations, providing an enabling envi ronment for universal banking, improved corporate governance in private sector banks, and enabling consolidation of banks in the private sector. Some other important m easures that promoted a vibrant and robust operating environment and framework for the banking system that promoted growth and business opportunities include a reduction in pre-emption through reserve requirements; shift to market determined pricing for government securities; disbanding of some of the administered interest rates; auction-based r epos-reverse repos for short-term liquidity management; facilitation of improved payment s and settlement mechanism; setting up of the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) to act as central counter party for facilitating payments and settlement system relating to fixed income securities, money market instruments and foreign exchange transactions; setting up of INFINET as the communication backbone for the financial sector; introduction of Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) for screen-based trading in gove rnment securities; introduction of Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System; debt recovery tribunals, asset reconstruction companies, settlement advisory committees, corporate debt restructuring mechanism, etc. for quicker recovery/ restructuring of stressed assets; promulgation of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest  13(SARFAESI) Act, 2002 and its subsequent amendment to ensure creditor rights; setting up of Credit Information Bureau of India Limited (CIBIL) for information sharing on defaulters as also other borrowers. These gr owth oriented initiatives have appropriately complemented the stability oriented initiatives.  Development Orientation In the context of the rapidly evolving financial landscape, the RBI has also been suitably reorienting its regulatory and supervisory framework to meet the needs of the common man. It has also been the endeavour of the RBI to improve credit delivery and customer service by banks. The RBI has simultaneously focussed on financial inclusion and extension of banking services to the unbanked areas of the economy. The guidelines on lending to the priority sector included improv ement of credit delivery to those sectors of the economy that impact large segment of the population, the weaker section and to the sectors which are employment-intensive such as agriculture and tiny and small enterprises. In order to improve credi t delivery to micro and small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), the RBI has urged banks to review their institutional arrangements for delivering credit to the SME sector, especially in identified clusters in various parts of the country, and to take measures to strengthen the expertise in and systems at branches located in or near such identified clusters with a view to providing adequate and timely credit. The RBI has taken several measures in recent years aimed at providing customer service at reasonable cost. These measures include enhancing customer protection and disclosures, code of ethics and grievance redressal, among others. The RBI\u2019s broad approach to financial inclusion aims at \u2018c onnecting people\u2019 with the banking system and not just credit dispensation; giving people access to the payments system; and portraying financial inclusion as a viable business model and opportunity. The RBI has been initiating measures to improve the outreach of banks and their services, and promote financial inclusion in less developed states and union territories. Monetary Policy As a part of the conduct of monetary policy, the RBI monitors, inter alia , monetary and credit aggregates. It uses both liquidity and interest rate instruments to achieve the monitory policy objectives. Pre-emptive actions have been taken since 2004 to withdraw monetary accommodation which was reinforced wi th measures aimed at moderating early signs of over-heating. Further, appreciati on of the possible permanent and temporary components with regard to oil prices has been articulated in the policies. While undertaking a nuanced approach to managing aggregate demand recognising the elements of shock and consequent impact on inflation expectations, the underlying  14demand conditions warranted several interest rate and liquidity measures in recent weeks.   While monetary policy influences aggregat es, reality is often dis-aggregated. Hence, the RBI uses prudential regulatory policies to complement the monetary policy measures and objectives. It is pertinent that the lender of last resort function is not separate either from monetary and liquidit y management or from financial regulation. Thus both monetary policy and prudential regulations are used as complementary tools to achieve the central bank objectives and they both support and reinforce each other. IV. Concluding Remarks on Broader Issues    The detailed account given above of the developments in the global and the Indian financial sector would be incomplete without devoting some attention to the broader issues. These issues need to be reckoned and debated widely lest the response to recent developments be construed as internal to the financial sector, warranting only such sector-specific solutions. First, whether the benefits of financial liberalisation and financial globalisation need to be re-evaluated? It is possible to argue that liberalisation of trade in goods has contributed more to growth and price stability than financial sector initiatives. In particular, it may be argued that the incentive frameworks for financial intermediaries appear to be disproportionate to their conceivable contribution to the economy. The arguments in favour of persevering with financial innovation and urging regulators to continue to give priority to facilitate innovations should be viewed in this context. Second, whether the regulators have placed greater emphasis on savings of capital in banks rather than on the interests of the depositors and on systemic stability? The recent compulsions for shoring up of capital by some of the global financial institutions in advanced economies seem to suggest this. What induced the regulators to permit such excesses in leverage and savings of capital? Does this also involve issues pertaining to governance and accountability of regulators? Third, whether there is a beginning of fiscalisation of the financial sector in view of the intensification of the links between the two? For example, the recent episodes of participation of the sovereign wealth funds in the re-capitalisation of banks tantamount to fiscal support. Further, large doses of liquidity support to financial markets by regulators against collateral may also involve quasi-fiscal costs, under some circumstances.   15 Fourth, whether there is, what may be ca lled, financialisation of the political economy? The attractiveness of financial interm ediaries in terms of high profitability, significant growth \u2013 especially cross-border, massive spread of investors, and the inadequate scope for application of principles of rules of origin in the financial sector could have resulted in enhanced clout for thes e intermediaries in the political economy. Incidentally, Professor Jagdish Bhagwati\u2019s reference to Wall Street \u2013 Washington links is relevant in this context.   Fifth, whether there has been excessive financialisation of corporates, in the sense that large corporates take significant positions in the financial markets through their treasury operations? Increasingly, many of the positions of the corporates in the financial markets may not be related to their underlying business. Do we have an issue when such activities of corporates in the financial mark ets, unrelated to their underlying business, are not regulated the way similar activities of financial market intermediaries are regulated?  To conclude, on the way forward, to exit the current financial turbulence and fortify against future similar episodes, we may need to look beyond reforms within the financial sector and address broader related issues that impinge on the balance between the sovereign, the regulators, the financial institutions and the markets.  Thank you. ", "26 Feb 14 MP.pdf": "1  Fighting Inflation  (Inaugural speech by Dr. Raghuram Rajan, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at FIMMDA -PDAI Annual Conference 2014, on February 26, 2014 at Mumbai)  Thank you for inviting me.  The Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of Indi a (FIMMDA) has been playing an important role in the Indian bond, money and derivatives markets. It has been working with the Reserve Bank in various capacities and has helped us address emerging challenges. I thank all of you for that. The sessions in the  conference are all of current interest, and therefore I have chosen to speak on an issue, inflation, which is of paramount relevance to fixed income markets.  As you know, t he Reserve Bank for India was constituted \u201cto regulate the issue of Bank notes and  the keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage\u201d.  Implicit in these words are the core purposes of the RBI : to foster monetary and financi al stability conducive to sustainable economic growth , and to ensure the development of an efficient and inclusive financial system.  Note that t he RBI is committed to getting the strongest growth possible for India \u2013 there is no difference between us and  North Block on this. W e believe the best way we can foster sustainable growth in the current situation , other than through developing the financial sector,  is through monetary stability -- by bringing down inflation over a reasonable period of time. More sp ecifically, we intend to bring CPI inflation down to 8 percent by January 2015 and 6 percent by January 2016.  There are a number of points here that need elaborating. First, are we choosing to tackle inflation at the expense of growth?  Most people believ e there is a short run trade -off between growth and inflation. By raising interest rates, the RBI causes banks to raise rates and thus lowers demand ; firms do not borrow as much to invest when rates are higher  and individuals stop buying durable goods agai nst credit and , instead, turn to save. Lower demand growth  leads to a better match between demand and supply, and thus lower inflation for the goods being produced, but also lower growth.  Relatedly, if lower rates generate  higher demand and high er inflati on, people may produce more believing that they are getting more revenues, not realizing that high inflation reduces what they can buy out of the revenues. Following the saying , 2  \u201cYou can fool all the people some of the time\u201d, bursts of inflation can genera te growth for some time . Thus in the short run, the argument goes, higher inflation leads to higher growth.  But as the public gets used to the higher level of inflation, the only way to fool the public again is to generate yet higher inflation. The result is an inflationary spiral which creates tremendous costs for the public. Therefore, economists have argued \u2013 and a number of Nobel prizes have been given for the ideas contained in the previous paragraphs \u2013 that the best way for the central bank to generat e growth in the long run is for it to bring down inflation.  Sooner or later, the public always understands what the central bank is doing , whether for the good or for the bad . And if the public starts expecting that inflation will stay low, the central ban k can cut interest rates significantly, thus encouraging demand and growth. Indeed, the reason the Malaysian Central Bank can keep rates low today to foster growth is because it has fought the battle against inflation and convinced its citizens that, i f need be, it will smote  the inflationary beast again if it rears its head.   Put differently, in order to generate sustainable growth, we have to fight inflation first. Let me also add that greater public faith that inflation will be low will add stability to  our currency, and prevent the kind of gyrations we saw last summer. Exchange rate stability is centrally in business interests.  If we have to bring down inflation, we have to start today. We cannot wait till the public\u2019s expectations of inflation get more entrenched, and the inflationary spiral gains momentum.  This is why we have raised interest rates 3 times since September.  But what  about industrialist s who tell  us to cut rates?  I have yet to meet an industrialist who does not want lower rates, whatever  the level of rates. But w ill a lower policy interest rate today give him more incentive to invest? We  at the RBI think not. First, we  don\u2019t believe the primary factor holding back investment today is high interest rates. Second, even if we cut rates, we d on\u2019t believe banks, wh ich are paying higher deposit rates, will cut their lending rates. The reason is that the depositor, given her high inflation ary expectations , will not settle for less than the rates banks are paying her. Inflation is placing a floor on deposit rates, and thus on lending rates.  Currently, therefore, we do not believe the policy rate is at a level where it can affect demand, one way or the other. We do believe, however, that as inflation comes 3  down  because of the  weak economy and strong  food production , the policy rate will become a stronger influence on bank interest rate s etting, and will start influencing demand.   A more important source of our influence today, therefore , is expectations. If people believe we are serious about inflat ion, and their expectations of inflation start coming down, inflation will also come down.  Of course, many people form expectations simply by extrapolating the most recent or most salient experience they have. So we also need to take advantage of the curre nt episode of food price disinflation to bring down expectations  \u2013 yet another reason for acting now.   Let us turn from answering those who want us to go slow to those who want us to do more. If we think inflation is so important, why don\u2019t we \u201cdo a Volck er\u201d and try and bring down inflation quickly by raising rates sky high? Of course, if we do raise policy rates substantially, banks will also have to raise rates to match us. While this may lead to a collapse in demand and bring inflation down quickly, it will cause significant damage to the economy \u2013 remember the severe recession Volcker\u2019s Fed brought about and the Savings and Loan Crisis that followed? A developing country is not in the same resilient position as the United States. Rather than administer shock therapy to a weak economy, the RBI prefers to dis -inflate over time  rather than abruptly , while being prepared to do what is necessary if the economy deviates from the projected inflation path. As of now, we believe the rate is appropriately set.  Then there are those who believe we are moving too independently . All we have done thus far is to adopt  the reasonable suggestion of the Patel Committee that we focus on CPI inflation rather than WPI inflatio n as our primary objective. The Patel Committee has  also suggested a time horizon to glide down to 6 percent inflation that s eems do able without extreme hardship . If the eventual decision  of the government, in consultation with  the Reserve Bank , is to adopt t he recommendations of the Mistry, CFSR, FSLRC an d the Patel Committee s, and focus on some form of an inflation objective, it would be good for the medium term inflation target to be set by the executive or the legislature, presumably based on advice from the Reserve Bank  and other experts . The Patel Com mittee report is out there for public comment and debate, and once we collect and analyse comments, we will take an interna l view and then start deliberations  with the government.  All this said, international experience suggests that , ideally, once the cen tral bank\u2019s objective is given, and the 4  operational target fixed, the government should leave the technocrats in the central bank to do their job.   Finally, does the Patel Committee intend to turn the RBI into  inflation \u201cnutters\u201d focussed on bringing down  inflation to the exclusion of all else, including financial stability? Of course not! Medium term flexible inflation targe tting means that the monetary policy committee focus ses on inflation over the medium term, being concerned about too high, as well as  too low, inflation. That means it may be willing to overlook temporary inflation spikes (such as , this November\u2019s inflation numbers) but also raise rates when sustained low interest rates and low inflation increase threats to financial stability \u2013 because  a financial crisis could lead to deflation.  In other words, the monetary policy committee will not put on blinkers  and see just the inflation number . A number of emerging markets have adopted some form of targe tting, while \u201cnon -targe tters\u201d like the Fed ta rget inflation in all but name , including putting a numerical target to its goal of price stability . In the remaining time, I want to present one more issue that has many commentators exercised \u2013 they say the real problem is food inflation, how do you expe ct to br ing it down through the policy rate ? The simple answer to such critics is that core CPI inflation, which excludes food and energy, has also been very high, reflecting the high inflation in services. Bringing that down is centrally  within the RBI\u2019s ambit.  But I will argue that policy is not irrelevant even in controlling food inflation , though clearly, the government also has an important role to play .  1. Role of food prices in the high inflation experience of r ecent years  Headline inflation measured b y the new CPI  has remained in double digits  during April 2012 to January 2014 , averag ing 10 per cent  over this period . Food inflation, which has a weight of 47.6 per cent  in the index, has contributed the largest share of headline inflation (Chart 1). Food  inflation itself has stayed in double digits throughout this period , edging down to 9.9 per cent  only in January 2014 .        5     Chart 1: Contribution to CPI Inflation   2. Why are food prices  high ? Although domestic production  has increased steadily, barrin g reversals in 2009 -10 and 2012 -13, this has not been reflected in a softening of food prices . Let us try and understand why.   Growing prosperity and dietary shifts  Data on household consumption expenditure show  that the share of food in overall consumptio n has been declining during the last decade  (Chart 2), but at a milder pace than the significant relative increase in food prices. This suggests that demand is relatively less elastic to price changes .           6   Chart 2: Change in Consumption Pattern   Despite  the decline in overall consumption share, per capita food consumption in real terms has increased , particularly in rural areas  (Chart 3).   Chart 3: Per Capita Food Consumption in Real Terms     Note: Deflators used  are CPI -AL for Rural consumption and CPI -IW for urban consumption   There has  also been a distinct shift in dietary pattern s towards protein -rich items and other high value foods (Chart 4 and Chart 5). The se items, in turn, have been contributing significantly to overall food price increas es in the recent period.     7  Chart 4: Change in Dietary Pattern      Chart 5: Monthly per Capita Quantity Consumed (in kgs)     * Egg consumption is in number    Other Possible  Causes of High Food Price Inflation  a. Minimum Support Price  One obvious cause f or higher food price inflation that analysts have pointed to is higher minimum support prices  (MSP) . The minimum support price  is set by the government on the recommendations of the CACP, based on a variety of factors 8  including primarily the cost of produc tion and  price trends in the market (domestic and international) . The crops covered under MSP constitute more than a third  of the category \u2018 primary articles \u2019 in the WPI. Since  minimum support prices are intended to be a floor for market prices, and have so metimes directly set the market price when increases have been substantial, for key crops  the rate of price inflation seems to relate to  the increase in MSP  in recent years  (Chart 6). Chart 6: MSP change and Inflation during 2005 -06 to 2012 -13   Another w ay of saying this is that there has been a shift in the relative price of agricultural commodities, engineered by the rise in MSPs. If the idea is to get more food production to meet the rising demand we documented, this is just what is needed. In C hart 7 (a), we plot  the ratio of WPI of food to WPI of non -food items . This suggests an appreciable i mprovement in terms of trade for agriculture .            9   Chart 7: MSP and Internal Terms of Trade  of Agricultural Commodities      But when we look at the ratio  of  changes in input cost over the changes in the output price  of agricultural commodities  received on the basis of CACP data, it has remained flat, indicating that the gains from MSP increases have not accrued to the farm sector in full measure on accoun t of rising costs of inputs.  This may indicate why production growth has not been stronger . What could explain this?  One explanation could be that MSPs also drive input costs, so increasing MSPs is like a dog chasing its tail \u2013 it can never catch it. Anot her could be that since rice and wheat are the primary food commodities procured at the MSP, production is distorted towards rice and wheat, leading to a suboptimal production mix by farmers \u2013 too much rice and wheat, and too little of other needed commodi ties. Both these explanations would suggest the need for more moderation as the government sets the MSPs in coming months.  It is useful though, to look at the details of the cost increases. Prices of agricultur al inputs , including wages , have  recorded a sh arp increase during  2008 -09 through 2012 -13 in comparison with the precedi ng five years  (2004 -05 to 2007 -08) as shown below (Table  1). Perhaps the most significant increase has been in rural wages.    10    Table 1: Increases in Select Farm Input Prices         (Annual average, per cent)   2004 -05 to 2007 -08 2008 -09 to 2012 -13 Food Articles  7.3 11.4  Fertilizers and Pesticides  1.7 7.8 Fodder  1.3 19.5  Gola (Cattle Feed)  12.2  10.2  High Speed Diesel  4.5 8.0 Electricity (Agricultural)  2.3 8.7 Tractors  3.6 5.4 Wages (Average)  6.2 17.3  Source: Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Labour   For example, w age increases have accounted for the largest share of increase in paddy input costs  (Chart 8).  Chart 8: Variable Cost  of Paddy Cultivation     Nominal rural wages have gr own at a sharp pace during the last five years. Because so many Indian workers are at subsistence wages, higher food prices do drive rural wages higher , and t here is some evidence for this  before 2007 . From 11  2007 onwards, however, econometric tests s uggest causality has flowed from wages to prices, underscoring the role of rural wages as a  major determinant in food price increases .  So w hy has rural wage growth been so strong?   b. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA ) A sharp p ickup in rural wages was seen after the rural employment guarantee program (assuring 100 days of employment to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work ) was enacted . MGNREGA may have contributed to the bargaining power of r ural workers, but careful econometric studies suggest that it accounts for only a small fraction of the rural wage increase , and indeed, any effect is waning  (Chart 9) .That said, the indexation of M GNREGA wages  suggests its effects in push ing rural wage in flation will not disappear entirely .   Chart 9: Comparative Movement of Wages and Prices in Rural India   Note: Wages pertain to rural male unskilled labourer  c. Rural Liquidity and Credit  There has been an increase in liquidity flowing to the agricultural se ctor, both from land sales, as well as from a rise in agricultural credit  (Chart 10) . More loans to agriculture have  fostered substantial private investment in agriculture, but may also have pushed up rural wages.  12   d. Labour shifting to Construction   The labour force has been moving from agriculture to non -agriculture sectors , particularly construction . This would have  the effect of pulling up rural labour ers\u2019 wages  (due to scarcity) , especially in the labour supplying states.  Total  agricultural labour declin ed from 259 million in 2004 -05 to 231 million in 2012 -12. Agriculture, which accounted for 60 per cent of total employment in 1999 -2000, now accounts for less than 50 per cent  (Chart 11 and Table 2) .           13  Chart   11: Sectoral  Employment Pattern     Table 2: Sector -wise S hare in Employment  (Per cent)  Sectors  1999 -2000  2004 -05 2009 -10 2011 -12 Agriculture  60 57 53 49 Secondary sector excluding construction*  12 13 12 14 Construction  4 6 10 11 Services  24 25 25 27 Total  100 100 100 100 *Includes manufa cturing, mining and quarrying, electricity and water supply  Source: NSSO and 12th Plan Document    e. Female  participation   One of the more  interesting possible explanation s for the rise in rural wages is t he changing female participation in rural markets . The female participation rate is down  in all the age categories . Improved living standards could lead rural families to withdraw women from the labo ur force (Chart 1 2). Also, higher prosperity could lead to greater investment in educating girls ( for the age group 10 to 24 ) again leading to lower participation in the workforce .    14   Chart  12: Labour Force Participation Rate     Source: NSSO Employment and Unemployment Survey 2011 -12.  3. To summaris e In su m then, when we examine food inflation, a substantial port ion stems from an increase in food production costs, primarily rural wage inflation. Some of that is an increase in real wages, needed to attract labour to agriculture, away from construction, education, household work, or M GNREGA. If, however, wages elsew here also go up, the necessary shift in relative wages to keep agricultural work attractive will  not take place, and we will continue to have  a wage spiral. Also, some of the agricultural wage growth may be because of more liquidity flowing into rural areas. Somewhat paradoxically, to contain food inflation and get a strong increase in food production, we need to  (i) Contain the rise in wages elsewhere so that relative wages in agriculture can rise without too much overall increase in wages.  (ii) Contain any  unwarr anted rise in rural wages as well as the rise in other agricultural input costs (though not through subsidies) so that the farmer gets a higher return.  (iii) Allow food prices to be determined by the market and use minimum support prices to provide only a lower level of support  so that production decisions do not get distorted or the price wage spiral 15  accentuated . This means limiting the pace of MSP increases going forward.  (iv) Reduce the wedge between what the farmer gets and what is paid by the household by reducin g the role, number, and monopoly power of middlemen  (amend APMC Acts) , as well as by improving logistics . (v) Improve farm productivity through technology extension, irrigation, etc.   Note that of these steps, monetary policy has a direct role in (i)  and (ii) by slowing the demand for labour and by anchoring inflation expectations and thereby moderating wage bargaining. Indeed, with the slowdown  in the in the urban economy, there is so me evidence now that rural wage growth is slowing  (Chart 1 3), though a recent  pick up is of concern .  Chart 1 3: Wages and Inflation in Rural Areas          Note: Wages pertain to rural male unskilled labourer  Finally, our food prices have largely caught up with global prices (we we re the world\u2019s largest rice exporter  last year ). Giv en that global food prices have been moderating, such moderation should feed through to domestic food prices \u2013 provided we do not intervene to prevent the feed -through of global prices , and do not intervene in limiting exports or imports .  Let me emphasis e that the RBI welcomes rural prosperity and wants to help increase rural productivity through appropriate credit  and investment . But recent 16  inflation has n ot helped strengthen the hand o f the farmer, so the fight against inflation is also  in the farmer\u2019s i nterest.   To sum up,  \uf0b7 As prosperity has increased the demand for food, we have need ed more food production (or imports) .  \uf0b7 Higher agricultural commodity prices should have incentivized farmers to produce significantly more.  \uf0b7 They have, but not enough. Part  of the reason may be that farmer  earnings are being eaten away by higher costs, most important of which is wages.  \uf0b7 To limit the rise in rural wages, given that it has to rise relative to other wages to attract labour into agriculture, wages elsewhere should  not rise as much.  \uf0b7 Monetary policy is an appropriate tool with which to limit the rise in wages, especially urban ones.  \uf0b7 The slowdown in rural wage growth may be partly the consequence of tighter policy  limiting wage rise elsewhere . \uf0b7 Of course, monetary poli cy\u2019s effectiveness in  containing other price and wage increases (such as , services prices , which are an important part of the CPI index) ) is far less controversial.   To conclude, t he RBI believes its fight against inflation will have traction , despite food being an important component of the CPI.    ***********  ", "10 Apr 14 MP.pdf": "1Competitive Monetary Easing: Is it yesterday once more? 1Good morning. As the world seems to be struggling back to its feet after the great financialcrisis, I want to draw attention to an area we need to be concerned about: the conduct ofmonetary policy in this integrated world. A good way to describe the current environment isone of extreme monetary easing through unconventional policies. In a world where debtoverhangs and the need for structural change constrain domestic demand, a sizeable portionof the effects of such policies spillover across borders, sometimes through a weaker exchangerate. More worryingly, it prompts a reaction. Such competitive easing occurs bothsimultaneously and sequentially, as I will argue, and both advanced economies and emergingeconomies engage in it. Aggregate world demand may be weaker and more distorted than itshould be, and financial risks higher. To ensure stable and sustainable growth, theinternational rules of the game need to be revisited. Both advanced economies and emergingeconomies need to adapt, else I fear we are about to embark on the next leg of a wearisomecycle.Central bankers are usually reluctant to air their concerns in public. But because the neededchange has political elements to it, I take my cue from speeches by two central bankers whomI respect greatly, Ben Bernanke in his 2005 \u201cGlobal Savings Glut\u201d speech, and JaimeCaruana in his 2012 speech at Jackson Hole, both of whom have raised similar concerns tomine, although from different perspectives.B ef ore s ta r ti n g , I s h oul d di scl os e m y i n te re s ts i n th i s e ra of tra n s p a ren cy . F or th e l a s t f e wmonths India has experienced large inflows of capital, not outflows, and is seen by themarkets as an emerging economy that has made some of the necessary policy adjustments.2We are well buffered with substantial reserves, though no country can be de-coupled from theinternational system.  My remarks are motivated by the desire for a more stable internationalsystem, a system that works equally for rich and poor, large and small, and not the specificsof our situation.Unconventional PolicyI want to focus on unconventional monetary policies (UMP), by which I mean both policiest h a t h o l d i n t e r e s t r a t e s a t n e a r z e r o f o r l o n g , a s w e l l a s b a l a n c e s h e e t p o l i c i e s s u c h a squantitative easing or exchange intervention, that involve altering central bank balance sheetsin order to affect certain market prices.3 The key point that I will emphasize throughout thistalk is that quantitative easing and sustained exchange intervention are in an economicequivalence class, though the channels they work through may be somewhat different. Ourattitudes towards them should be conditioned by the size of their spillover effects rather thanby any innate legitimacy of either form of intervention.Let me also add there is a role for unconventional policies \u2013 when markets are broken orgrossly dysfunctional, central bankers do have to think innovatively. Fortunately for theworld, much of what they did immediately after the fall of Lehman was exactly right, thoughthey were making it up as they went in the face of extreme uncertainty. They eased access toliquidity through innovative programs such as TALF, TAF, TARP, SMP, and LTRO. Bylending long term without asking too many questions of the collateral they received, by1Remarks by Dr. Raghuram G. Rajan at the Brookings Institution, April 10, 2014.These are my personal views. I acknowledge very useful comments from Joshua Felman, Prachi Mishra,Jonathan Ostry, Michael Patra, Eswar Prasad, and Tharman Shanmugharatnam.2 See Mishra et al. (2014).3See Borio and Disyatat (2009) for an excellent early comprehensive taxonomy and assessment of balance sheetpolicies.2buying assets beyond usual limits, and by focusing on repairing markets, they restoredliquidity to a world financial system that would otherwise have been insolvent based onprevailing market asset prices. In this matter, central bankers are deservedly heroes.4The key question is what happens when these policies are prolonged long beyond repairingmarkets \u2013 and there the benefits are much less clear. Let me list 4 concerns:1)Is unconventional monetary policy the right tool once the immediate crisis is over?D o e s i t d i s t o r t b e h a v i o r a n d a c t i v i t y s o a s t o s t a n d i n t h e w a y o f r e c o v e r y ? I saccommodative monetary policy the way to fix a crisis that was partly caused byexcessively lax policy?2)Do such policies buy time or does the belief that the central bank is takingresponsibility prevent other, more appropriate, policies from being implemented? Putdifferently, when central bankers say, however reluctantly, that they are the onlygame in town, do they become the only game in town?3)Will exit from unconventional policies be easy?4)What are the spillovers from such policies to other countries?Since I have dwelt at length on the first two concerns in an earlier speech, let me focus on thelast two.5ExitThe macroeconomic argument for prolonged unconventional policy in industrial countries isthat it has low costs, provided inflation stays quiescent. Hence it is worth pursuing, even ifthe benefits are uncertain. A number of economists have, however, raised concerns aboutfinancial sector risks that may build with prolonged use of unconventional policy.6 Assetprices may not just revert to earlier levels on exit, but they may overshoot on the downside,and exit can cause significant collateral damage.One reason is that leverage may increase both in the financial sector and amongst borrowersas policy stays accommodative.7 One channel seems to be that a boost to asset liquidity leadslenders to believe that asset sales will backstop loan recovery, leading them to increase loanto value ratios. When liquidity tightens, though, too many lenders rely on asset sales, causingasset prices and loan recovery to plummet. Because lenders do not account for the effects oftheir lending on the \u201cfire sale\u201d price, and subsequently on lending by others, they may havean excessive incentive to build leverage.8 These effects are exacerbated if, over time, lendersbecome reliant on asset sales for recovery, rather than on upfront project evaluation and duediligence. Another possible channel is that banks themselves become more levered, orequivalently, acquire more illiquid balance sheets, if the central bank signals it will intervenein a sustained way when times are tough because unemployment is high.94I was not a member of the fraternity at that time, so I do not feel a conflict in doling out praise!5\u201cA step in the dark: unconventional monetary policy after the crisis\u201d, Raghuram Rajan,Andrew Crockett Memorial Lecture delivered at the BIS on 23 June 2013.6See Borio (2014), Borio and Disyatat (2009), Stein (2013), though see Chodorow-Reich (2014) for analternative viewpoint. One question about Chodorow-Reich\u2019s assessment that quantitative easing does not, byand large, prompt risk taking is that he uses market prices to estimate effects, even though these pricesthemselves could be distorted by risk taking.7For evidence, see for example Becker and Ivashina (2013), Bruno and Shin (2014 a,b), Ioannidou, Ongena andPeydr\u00f3 (2009), Maddaloni and Peydr\u00f3 (2010).8 Stein, Jeremy. 2012. Monetary Policy as Financial-Stability Regulation. Quarterly Journal of Economics 127,no. 1: 57-95.9 See Diamond and Rajan (2012), Farhi and Tirole (2012) and Acharya, Pagano and Volpin (2013). Theproblem is exacerbated if unemployment is driven by factors that move to a different cycle and pace than thefinancial cycle.3Leverage need not be the sole reason why exit may be volatile after prolongedunconventional policy. Investment managers may fear underperforming relative to others.This means they will hold a risky asset only if it promises a risk premium (over safe assets)that makes them confident they will not underperform holding it.10 A lower path of expectedreturns on the safe asset makes it easier for the risky asset to meet the required risk premium,and indeed draws more investment managers to buy it \u2013 the more credible the forwardguidance on \u201clow for long\u201d, the more the risk taking. However, as investment managerscrowd into the risky asset, the risky asset is more finely priced so that the likelihood ofpossible fire sales increases if the interest rate environment turns. Every manager dumps therisky asset at that point in order to avoid being the last one holding it.Leverage and investor crowding may therefore exacerbate the consequences of exit. Whenmonetary policy is ultra-accommodative, prudential regulation, either of the macro or microkind, is probably not a sufficient defence. In part, this is because, as Fed Governor Stein sosuccinctly put it, monetary policy \u201cgets into every crack\u201d, including the unregulated part ofthe financial system.11 In part, ultra accommodative monetary policy creates enormouslypowerful incentive distortions whose consequences are typically understood only after thefact. The consequences of exit, however, are not just felt domestically, they could beexperienced internationally.SpilloversPerhaps most vulnerable to the increased risk-taking in this integrated world are countriesacross the border. When monetary policy in large countries is extremely andunconventionally accommodative, capital flows into recipient countries tend to increase locall ev erage; thi s i s n ot j ust due to th e di rect effect of cross-b order b an ki n g fl ows b ut al so th eindirect effect, as the appreciating exchange rate and rising asset prices, especially of realestate, make it seem that borrowers have more equity than they really have.12Exchange rate flexibility in recipient countries in these circumstances sometimes exacerbatesbooms rather than equilibrates. Indeed, in the recent episode of emerging market volatilityafter the Fed started discussing taper in May 2013, countries that allowed the real exchangerate to appreciate the most during the prior period of quantitative easing suffered the greatestadverse impact to financial conditions.13 Countries that undertake textbook policies offinancial sector liberalization are not immune to the inflows \u2013 indeed, their deeper marketsmay draw more flows in, and these liquid markets may be where selling takes place whenconditions in advanced economies turn.14Macro-prudential measures have little traction against the deluge of inflows \u2013 Spain had ahousing boom despite its countercyclical provisioning. Recipient countries should adjust, ofcourse, but credit and flows mask the magnitude and timing of needed adjustment. Forinstance, higher collections from property taxes on new houses, sales taxes on new sales,capital gains taxes on financial asset sales, and income taxes on a more prosperous financialsector may suggest a country\u2019s fiscal house is in order, even while low risk premia onsovereign debt add to the sense of calm. At the same time, an appreciating nominal exchangerate may also keep down inflation.10 See Feroli , Kashyap, Schoenholtz, and Shin (2014) for details.11See Stein (2013).12 See Bruno and Shin (2014 a, b), Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart (1996), Obstfeld (2012), Rey (2013), andSchularick and Taylor (2012) for example.13 See Eichengreen and Gupta (2013) and Mishra, Moriyama, N\u2019Diaye, and Nguyen (2014).14See Prasad (2014, p 198) and Eichengreen and Gupta (2013).4The difficulty of distinguishing the cyclical from the structural is exacerbated in someemerging markets where policy commitment is weaker, and the willingness to succumb to thesiren calls of populist policy greater. But it would be a mistake to think that pro-cyclicalpolicy in the face of capital inflows is primarily a disease of the poor; Even rich recipientcountries with strong institutions, such as Ireland and Spain, have not been immune tocapital-flow-induced fragility.Ideally, recipient countries would wish for stable capital inflows, and not flows pushed in byunconventional policy. Once unconventional policies are in place, however, they dorecognize the problems stemming from prolonged easy money, and thus the need for sourcecountries to exit. But when source countries move to exit unconventional policies, somerecipient countries are leveraged, imbalanced, and vulnerable to capital outflows. Given thatinvestment managers anticipate the consequences of the future policy path, even a measuredpace of exit may cause severe market turbulence and collateral damage.15 Indeed, the moretransparent and well-communicated the exit is, the more certain the foreign investmentmanagers may be of changed conditions, and the more rapid their exit from risky positions.Recipient countries are not being irrational when they protest both the initiation ofunconventional policy as well as an exit whose pace is driven solely by conditions in thesource country. Having become more vulnerable because of leverage and crowding, recipientc o u n t r i e s m a y c a l l f o r a n e x i t w h o s e p a c e a n d t i m i n g i s r e s p o n s i v e , a t l e a s t i n p a r t , t oconditions they face.The Case for International Monetary Policy CoordinationHence, my call is for more coordination in monetary policy because I think it would be animmense improvement over the current international non-system. International monetarypolicy coordination, of course, is unpopular among central bankers, and I therefore have tosay why I reiterate the call and what I mean by it.I do not mean that central bankers sit around a table and make policy collectively, nor do Imean that they call each other regularly and coordinate actions. In its strong form, I proposethat large country central banks, both in advanced countries and emerging markets,internalize more of the spillovers from their policies in their mandate, and are forced by newconventions on the \u201crules of the game\u201d to avoid unconventional policies with large adversespillovers and questionable domestic benefits.16 Given the difficulties of operationalizing thestrong form, I suggest that, at the very least, central banks reinterpret their domestic mandateto take into account other country reactions over time (and not just the immediate feedbackeffects), and thus become more sensitive to spillovers. This weak \u201ccoordination\u201d could besupplemented with a re-examination of global safety nets.The Gains from CoordinationEconomists generally converged on the view that the gains to policy coordination were smallprovided each country optimized its own policies keeping in mind the policies of others. The\u201cNash equilibrium\u201d was not that far from the global optimum, hence the \u201cown house inorder\u201d doctrine was dominant in the international monetary field.17 National macroeconomicstability was seen as sufficient for international macroeconomic stability. The domestic andinternational aspects were essentially regarded as two sides of the same coin.15 See Feroli et al. (2014).16 Though see Caruana (2012),  Eichengreen et al. (2011), Jeanne (2014), and Taylor (2013) for proposals bycurrent and former policy makers and monetary economists.17 See Eichengreen et al. (2011). For an articulation of the doctrine, see Rose (2007) or Taylor (2013).5Two factors have led to a rethinking of the doctrine. First, domestic constraints includingpolitical imperatives of bringing unemployment down and the economic constraint of thez e r o l o w e r b o u n d m a y l e a d m o n e t a r y p o l i c y t o b e s e t a t l e v e l s d i f f e r e n t f r o m t h eunconstrained domestic optimal. Dysfunctional domestic politics could also contribute inmoving monetary policy further from the unconstrained optimal. In other words, the centralbank, responding to a variety of political pressures and weaknesses, may stray away fromeven the constrained optimal \u2013 towards third best policies rather than second best policies.Second, cross-border capital flows can lead to a more dramatic transmission of policies,driven by agency (and other) considerations that do not necessarily relate to economicconditions in the recipient countries.One argument along these lines is that if some large country adopts unconventional andhighly accommodative sub optimal policies, other countries may follow suit to avoidexchange rate appreciation in a world with weak demand.18 A s a r e s u l t , t h e p o l i c yequilibrium may establish at rates that are too low compared to that warranted by the globaloptimal. Another argument is that when the sending country is at the zero lower bound, andthe receiving country responds to capital inflows with aggressive reserve accumulation, bothmay be better off with more moderate policies.19 Indeed, it may well be that coordinationmay allow policy makers political room to move away from sub optimal policies. If politicalparalysis and consequent fiscal tightening forces a source country to a sub-optimal relianceon monetary stimulus, policy coordination that allows for expanded demand elsewhere couldallow the source country to cut back on its dependence on monetary stimulus.20Domestic Optimal is close to the Global OptimalDespite these arguments, official statements by multilateral institutions such as the IMFcontinue to endorse unconventional monetary policies while downplaying the adverses p i l l o v e r e f f e c t s t o o t h e r c o u n t r i e s . I n d e e d , i n a n e x c e l l e n t a n a l y s i s o f t h e o b s t a c l e s t ointernational policy coordination, the IMF\u2019s own Jonathan Ostry and Atish Ghosh argue that\u201cimpartial\u201d international policy assessments by multilateral entities could be suspected ofbias21\u201c\u2026if there were a systematic tendency of the assessor to identify a change in policy (tighterfiscal policy; looser monetary policy; structural reform) as always yielding welfare gains atth e n ati onal an d gl obal l ev el s. Thi s woul d b reed suspi ci on b ecause th e base case sh oul d b ethat countries do not fail to exploit available welfare gains\u2026it is implausible that welfaregains at the national and global levels should always be positively correlated\u2026\u201dBy downplaying the adverse effects of cross-border monetary transmission of unconventionalpolicies, we are overlooking the elephant in the post-crisis room. I see two dangers here. Onei s th a t a n y rem ai ni n g rul es of th e g am e a re b re aki n g d ow n . O u r c ol l e c ti v e en d ors em en t ofunconventional monetary policies essentially says it is ok to distort asset prices if there areother domestic constraints to reviving growth, such as the zero-lower bound. But netspillovers, rather than fancy acronyms, should determine internationally acceptable policy.Otherwise, countries could legitimately practice what they might call quantitative externaleasing or QEE, whereby they intervene to keep their exchange rate down and build hugereserves. The reason we frowned on QEE in the past is because we believed the adversespill over effects for the rest of the worl d were significant. If we are unwilling, however, toevaluate all policies based on their spillover effects, there is no legitimate way multilateral18 See Taylor (2013).19 See Jeanne (2014).20See Ostry and Ghosh (2013).21 See Ostry and Ghosh (2013, p23).6institutions can declare that QEE contravenes the rules of the game. Indeed, some advancedeconomy central bankers have privately expressed their worry to me that QE \u201cworks\u201dprimarily by altering exchange rates, which makes it different from QEE only in degreerather than in kind.The second danger is a mismanaged exit will prompt fresh distortionary behaviour. Even assource country central banks go to great pains to communicate how their removal ofaccommodation will be contingent on domestic activity, they have been silent on how theywill respond to foreign turmoil. Market participants conclude that recipient countries,especi ally th ose th at do n ot b el on g to l arge reserv e curren cy bl ocks, are on th ei r own , andcrowd devastatingly through the exit.Indeed, the lesson some emerging markets will take away from the recent episode of turmoilis (i) don\u2019t expand domestic demand and run large deficits (ii) maintain a competitiveexchange rate (iii) build large reserves, because when trouble comes, you are on your own. Ina world with deficient aggregate demand, is this the message the international communitywants to send?For this is not the first episode in which capital has been pushed first in one direction andthen in another, each time with devastating effect. In the early 1990s, rates were held low inthe United States, and capital flowed to emerging markets. The wave of emerging marketcrises starting with Mexico in 1994 and ending with Argentina in 2001, sweeping throughEast Asia and Russia in between, was partially caused by a reversal of these flows as interestrates rose in industrial countries. The subsequent reserve build up in emerging markets,including China, contributed to weak global demand and excess spending by some industrialcountries, culminating in the global financial crisis of 2007-09. Once again, though, post-crisis unconventional monetary policy has pushed capital to emerging markets, with theassociated build up in fragility. Are we setting the stage for a resumption of the \u201cglobalsavings glut\u201d as emerging markets build reserves once again?Two obvious remedies suggest themselves; Less extreme monetary policies on all sides withsome thought given to adverse spillover effects when setting policy, and better global safetynets to mitigate the need for countries to self-insure through reserve buffers.More Moderate PolicyEven though we live in a world where monetary transmission is global, policy focus is local.C en tra l b an k s m oun t a n um b e r of d ef en c es a s to w h y th ey sh ou l d n ot ta k e f ul l a c c ou n t ofspillovers. One way to demonstrate the weaknesses in the usual arguments that are putforward to defend the status quo is to see how they would sound if they were used to defendQEE, that is, sustained intervention in the exchange market to keep the exchange ratecompetitive.Defense 1: We are a developing country and we are mandated to support growth. Institutionalconstraints in enhancing productivity, and our vulnerability to sudden stops, means that acompetitive exchange rate, and thus QEE, is essential to fulfilling our mandate.22Def ense 2: W oul d th e worl d n ot b e b etter off i f we grew stron gl y ? QEE i s essen ti al to ou rgrowth.Defense 3: We take into account feedback effects to our economy from the rest of the worldwhile setting policy. Therefore, we are not oblivious to the consequences of QEE on othercountries.22 See Rodrik (2008) on why exchange undervaluation may be essential for emerging economies.7Defense 4: Monetary policy with a domestic focus is already very complicated and hard tocommunicate. It would be impossibly complex if we were additionally burdened with havingto think about the effects of QEE on other countries.There are many problems with these defenses that those who have complained aboutcurrency manipulation will recognize. Currency manipulation may help growth in the shortrun (even this is debatable), but creates long-run distortions that hurts the manipulatingcountry. There are more sensible policies to foster growth. And even if a central bank has apurely domestic mandate, the country\u2019s international responsibilities do not allow it toa r b i t r a r i l y i m p o s e c o s t s o n t h e r e s t o f t h e w o r l d . T h e n e t s p i l l o v e r e f f e c t s n e e d t o b eestimated, and it cannot be taken for granted that the positive spillovers from the initiatingcountry\u2019s growth (say through greater trade) more than offset the adverse spillovers to othercountries.  Feedback effects to the source country represent only a small part of the spillovereffects experienced by the world, and a central bank will be far from implementing theglobally optimal policy if it is solely domestically-oriented, even if it takes these feedbackeffects into account. Countries are required to pay attention to the effects of their policies onothers, no matter how much the added complication, because we all have internationalresponsibilities.Of course, the reader will recognize that each one of these arguments has been madedefending unconventional monetary policy. Yet multilateral institutions treat sustainedcurrency intervention with great opprobrium while giving unconventional monetary policy aclean chit. Should the cleanliness of the chit not depend on the size of the net spillovers andthe competitive response it engenders? Without estimating them carefully, how can we tell?Operationalizing Coordination: Some SuggestionsWe need to break away from this cycle of unconventional policies and competitive monetaryeasing. Already, the events of recent months have set the stage for renewed reserveaccumulation by the emerging markets. And this time, it will be harder for advancedeconomies to com plain if they downplay thei r own spill over effects while they are pushingfor recovery.An Independent AssessorIn an ideal world, unconventional monetary policies such as QE or QEE should be vetted byan independent assessor for their spillover effects.23 T h e a s s e s s m e n t p r o c e d u r e i s e a s y t ov i s u a l i z e ; P e r h a p s f o l l o w i n g a c o m p l a i n t b y a n i m p a c t e d c o u n t r y ( a s i n t h e W T O ) , t h eindependent assessor could analyse the effects of such policies and come to a judgment onwhether they follow the rules of the game. Policies where the benefits are largely domestic,while the costs fall largely abroad, would be especially carefully scrutinized. And if theassessor deems the policy reduces global welfare, international pressure should be applied tostop such policies.The problems with such an idealistic process are easy to see. Where is such an impartialassessor to be found? The staff at multilateral institutions is excellent, and well capable ofindependent judgment. But political pressure subsequent to the initial assessment operatesunevenly. Initial assessments typically remain unaltered when a small country complains (nocountry likes independent assessments), but are often toned down when a large economyprotests. There are many exceptions to this, but more work is needed to build trust in theimpartiality of assessments of multilateral institutions.23 See Ostry and Ghosh (2013) for the idea of an independent assessor.8Even if multilateral organizations become immune to power politics, they are not immune tocognitive capture. Their staff has been persuaded by the same models and frameworks as thestaff of industrial country central banks \u2013 models where monetary policy is an extremelypowerful tool to elevate activity, and exchange rate flexibility does wonders in insulatingcountries from the most debilitating spillovers. \u201cDecoupling\u201d is always possible in suchmodels, even though the evidence is that the models typically underestimate the extent of\u201ccoupling\u201d. Indeed, many of these models do not have realistic models of credit, or ofmonetary transmission in an economy with debt overhang, which reduces their valueconsiderably. Progress is being made but it will take time.And, of course, even if a truly independent assessment came to the conclusion that certainpolicies were in violation, how would such a judgment be enforced?The reality is that the rules of the game were framed in a different era to deter competitivedevaluations and currency manipulation. They have not been updated for today\u2019s world ofmore varied competitive easing. But it is unclear that even if they were updated, they couldbe assessed and enforced in the current environment.A More Modest ProposalPerhaps then, it would be better to settle for a more modest proposal. Central banks shouldassess spillover effects from their own actions, not just in terms of immediate feedback, butalso in terms of medium term feedback as other countries alter their policies. In other words,the source country should not just worry about the immediate flows of capital to othercountries from its policies, but the longer run reaction such as sustained exchangeintervention that this would bring about. This would allow central banks to pay moreattention to spillovers even while staying within their domestic mandate.For example, this would mean that while exiting from unconventional policies, central bankswould pay attention to conditions in emerging markets also while deciding the timing ofmoves, while keeping the overall direction of moves tied to domestic conditions. Their policystatements should acknowledge such concerns. To be concrete in a specific case, the Fedpostponing tapering in September 2013 allowed emerging economies more time to adjustafter the initial warning in May 2013. Whatever the underlying rationale for postponement, ithelped tapering start smoothly in December 2013, without disrupting markets. In contrast,with volatility hitting emerging markets after the Argentinian problems in January 2014, theFed policy statement in January 2014, with no mention of concern about the emerging marketsituation, and with no indication Fed policy would be sensitive to conditions in those marketsin the future, sent the probably unintended message that those markets were on their own.Speeches by Regional Fed Presidents emphasizing the Fed\u2019s domestic mandate did not help.Since then, Fed communication has been more nuanced, though the real challenge incommunication lies ahead when policy rates have to move up.24International Safety NetsEmerging economies have to work to reduce vulnerabilities in their economies, to get to thepoint where, like Australia, they can allow exchange rate flexibility to do much of theadjustment for them to capital inflows. But the needed institutions take time to develop. Inthe meantime, the difficulty for emerging markets in absorbing large amounts of capitalquickly and in a stable way should be seen as a constraint, much like the zero lower bound,rather than something that can be altered quickly. Even while resisting the temptation ofabsorbing flows, they will look to safety nets.24For a recent nuanced view from a key Fed President, see Dudley (2014).9So another way to prevent a repeat of substantial reserve accumulation is to build strongerinternational safety nets.25 As the financial crisis suggested, this is not just an emergingeconomy concern. In a world where international liquidity can dry up quickly, the worldneeds bilateral, regional, and multilateral arrangements for liquidity. Multilaterala rra n g em en ts a re tri e d an d te s te d , a n d a re a v ai l ab l e m ore wi d el y , an d wi th ou t s om e of th epossible political pressures that could arise from bilateral and regional arrangements. Indeedswap arrangements can be channelled through multilateral institutions like the IMF instead ofbeing conducted on a bilateral basis, so that the multilateral institution bears any (small)credit risk, and the source central bank does not have to justify the arrangements to itspolitical authorities.Perhaps equally valuable would be a liquidity line from the IMF, where countries are pre-qualified by the IMF and told (perhaps privately) how much of a line they would qualify forunder current policy \u2013 with access limits revised every Article IV and any curtailmentbecoming effective 6 months later.26 Access to the line would get activated by the IMF Boardin a situation of generalized liquidity shortage (as, for example, when policy tightening insource countries after an extended period of low rates causes investment managers to becomerisk averse). The IMF has suggested such arrangements in a discussion paper, and theyshould be explored because they allow countries access to liquidity without the stigma ofapproaching the Fund, and without the conditionality that accompanies most Fundarrangements.27Cl earl y , th e F un d\u2019s resources wi l l b e safe only if th e si tuati on i s on e of gen ui ne tem poraryilliquidity rather than one where countries need significant reforms to regain market access.Equally clearly, access will vary across countries, and prolonged use after the liquiditye m e r g e n c y i s d e c l a r e d o v e r w i l l n e c e s s i t a t e a n I M F p r o g r a m . N e v e r t h e l e s s , t h e t w i nproposals of the Global Stability Mechanism and Short-term Liquidity Line that the IMFBoard has examined in the past deserve close examination for they come closest to genuinelyhelping offset reserve build-up.Finally, it would be a useful exercise for the Fund, in a period of growing vulnerability tocapital flow reversals, to identify those countries that do not have own, bilateral, regional, orm ul ti l a te ral l i q ui di ty a rra n gem en ts t o f al l b a c k on , an d t o w ork t o i m p rov e th ei r ac c es s tosome safety net. The role of honest ex-ante marriage broker may be one that could prove tobe immensely important when the interest rate environment changes.ConclusionThe current non-system in international monetary policy is, in my view, a source ofsubstantial risk, both to sustainable growth as well as to the financial sector. It is not anindustrial country problem, nor an emerging market problem, it is a problem of collectiveaction. We are being pushed towards competitive monetary easing.If I use terminology reminiscent of the Depression era non-system, it is because I fear that ina world with weak aggregate demand, we may be engaged in a futile competition for agreater share of it. In the process, unlike Depression-era policies, we are also creatingfinancial sector and cross-border risks that exhibit themselves when unconventional policiescome to an end.28 There is no use saying that everyone should have anticipated thec o n s e q u e n c e s .

Exactly a  year ago, a page  was turned on a tradition that went back to the origins of the RBI in pre -independent India. The monetary policy decision, hitherto made solely by the Governor of the RBI, was ceded to a six -member committee  comprising the Governor as the Chairperson, the  Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy, one officer of the RBI appointed by its Central Board, and three external members appointed by the central government.  The room filled with debate and argumentation, challenge and counter- challenge, articulat ions of well -defended individualistic assessments, and voting  \u2013 India's monetary policy was undergoing  a regime change. Quietly ushered in, without any grandeur about it or anything like that, it was a big step towards the modernisation  of the conduct of monetary policy in India.   Invested by legislative mandate \u2013  through an amendment to the RBI Act \u2013  with the goal of 'maintaining price stability keeping in mind the objective of growth', India   joined a select but growing band of countries that, beginning in 199 0, adopted flexible inflation targeting (FIT) as their framework for monetary policy. Under FIT , price stability is accorded primacy as an objective  of monetary policy, while being  mindful of the state of the economy. Accordingly, the target for inflation is to be achieved over a medium term horizon rather than at a point in time to mitigate any                                                   1 The theme of this lecture was inspired by an interview given by Governor Dr. Urjit  R. Patel in the Mint, October 9 , 2017 available at http://www.livemint.com/Industry/Gr9H0MnqAL5Ko4PdGa7fdL/RBI -governor -Urjit -Patel -Weve -started -seeing -the-upturn -in.html . I am grateful to Dr. Viral V. Acharya for valuable comments.  Inputs from Shri Sitikantha Pattanaik, Dr. Praggya Das , Dr. Rajiv Ranjan , Dr. Rajeev Jain and Dr. Jai Chander  are also acknowledged with appreciation. The usual disclaimers apply.    2 output effect s that disinflation could entail. Furthermore , the target itself is set within a band or range in acknowledgement of potentia l supply shocks that well up outside monetary policy\u2019s realm. Accountability for failure to ensure the inflation band is generally defined , but after taking into account the various lags characterising the operation of monetary policy.    In India, the amended RBI Act defines the metric for the inflation target as the year-on-year change in the monthly consumer price index (CPI). T he numerical inflation target has been  set by the g overnment at four per cent, with an upper tolerance  level of 6 per ce nt and a lower tolerance  level of 2 per cent, internalis ing flexibility. The amended RBI Act has also specified accountability norms for dealing with failure to achieve the inflation target while building in recognition of the lags inherent in the conduct of monetary policy. It defines failure as average inflation breaching  the tolerance band for three consecutive quarters, not instantly. Although concerns about inflation had dominated monetary policy over the past decades in deference to a societal intolerance threshold, such an explicit commitment to a numerical inflation target as the centre -piece of policy had never been made.    It was veritably a baptism by fire for the MPC, the new kid on the block in a cross -country sense of the term. The amendment to  the RBI Act, the inflation target and tolerance band around it , and accountability with respect to failure to achieve the target were notified in the Gazette of India during May-August 2016 . They were widely telegraphed and occupied many media bytes. What  was little noticed , however, was that it was only on September 29, 2016 that  a press release of the Government of India (GoI) informed the world about the  appointment  of the MPC. Just one working day later, the MPC plunged into its work and on October 4, it issued its first resolution, unanimously backed. Many 'firsts' surround that debut .  As the statutory semi -annual Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of October 2016 noted: \u201cFor  the first time in its history, the RBI has been provided the explicit legislative mandate to operate the monetary policy framework of the country. The primary objective of monetary policy has also been d efined for the first time.  The amendments also 3 provide for the constitution of a monetary policy committee that shall determine the policy rate required to achieve the inflation target, another landmark in India's monetary history.\" Each of these milestones warrants a more detailed exposition to catch the inflexions around the turning point s. Indeed, each shall receive its due and enter the pantheon of legend s in my memoirs. In the interest of brevity and time, however, I shall devote the rest of my lecture to ( I) the initial conditions that brought to critical mass the urgency of the regime shift; ( II) the RBI's efforts to build t he institutional architecture  ahead of and to prepare the ground  for FIT; (III) the high wire that electrified the six decisions the MPC took in its formative year; and (IV) the conflicting pulls and trade -offs that shaped the decision of October 4, 2017 \u2013  arguab ly, one of the most testing .   II. The Initial Conditions   Today, the Indian economy basks in macroeconomic stability with a configuration that could be the envy of peers:  a fiscal deficit steadfastly consolidatin g towards a Maastricht- like rendezvous  with a strong con sensus that its quality matters;  inflation below target , shepherded by an MPC committed to the centre of the band notified by government; a current account deficit below 1 per cent of GDP and sustainab le in terms of a dashboard of externa l sector indicators \u2013  overall, a sweet spot by any consideration ! Yet, just four years ago, an ocean of vulnerability engulfed the economy. The situation around the \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d seemed so d ire that even a growth rate of 6.6  per cent and foreign exchange  reserves of close to US $ 3 00 billion seemed like matchsticks before a tide that swept India into the infamous 'fragile five' in that fateful summer of 2013 . In a fundamental way, it was those troubled conditions that provided the impetus for monetary pol icy regime change.  India was among the first nations to rebound from the  global financial crisis , with tailwinds from a fiscal stimulus, the RBI\u2019s policy rate cut cumulatively by 425 basis points and access to potential liquidity from the Reserve Bank expanded to as high as 10 per cent of GDP with a view to keeping financial institutions functional as 4 financial market s seized up . In 2009, g rowth seemed set to accelerate to the aspirational double digits that Indians dream about. Long embarrassed by the parlous state of the physical infrastructure, we set out to build world clas s roads, airports, power supply and ports. T he financial sector w as expected to take a lead role in creating conducive conditions for this big push even, as we have learned painfully, at the risk of much loss of governance and risk control .  There was , however, a  serpent in the garden ! Starting out innocuously in the gu ise of food prices rising on the back of a monsoon failure, inflation reared its ugly head, hidden behind the heady upswing of growth that deceptively appeared  too good to interrupt. The wholesale price index  (WPI), the official metric for measuring inflat ion then, failed to detect it initially \u2013  although the WPI food index rose by c lose to 15 per cent in 2009, headline inflation measured as the year- on-year change in the WPI remained below 4 per cent . It was beguilingly pulled down by the core measure of those days \u2013  WPI non- food manufactured products inflation was close to zero! By contrast, inflation in terms of the consumer price index  for industrial workers (CPI -IW) was raging at above 12 per cent. Spreadi ng incipiently, food inflation became generalised by 2010 -11. The WPI picked it up by then, and spillovers to prices of non-food manufactured products started getting manifested. By the time there was a policy reaction in March 201 0, it was too late. Over the period 2009 -12, inflation averaged 10.4 per cent  measured by  the CPI- IW and 7.4 per cent by the WPI. Thirteen policy rate increases failed to excoriate it . Entrenched now in the system, it began to mutate like a multi- headed Hydra .   Inflation is not j ust the rate of increase  of the price level. It is also considered an index of the quality of governance  and macroeconomic management by the  state which seeks to assure the well -being of its people who have relinquished to it some control over their lives for the greater common good. Indian society is well -known for zero tolerance for double digit inflation. Often in the not too distant past, it has been a  pivotal election  issue and governments have been voted out of office over the price of the lowly onion. In the year 2009 itself, inflation expectations of households a year 5 ahead rose by 400 basis points. By the end of the year, they crossed 12 per cent and kept climbing, entrenched in th ose high reaches. People were completely discounting the possibility of putting the genie back into the bottle. This time around, however, they did not take recourse to the ballot. They did something more sinister \u2013  they bought gold!   As inflation outcomes and expectations climbed, the real rate of return on bank deposits started to get eroded and even turned negative. Saving in financial assets became a losing proposition. So people pulled out their money from bank deposits and other finan cial assets and put it into gold. For India, buying gold is just another conduit of capital flight; only 2 per cent of India's gold demand is mined domestically. Since 2012, India was already the largest consumer of gold. In the troubled years (2009 -12), a n annual average of 700 -800 tonnes of gold imports surged to cross 1000 tonnes. With gold constituting 11 per cent of total imports, the current account deficit began to expand and by the third quarter of 2012 -13, it reached  6.8 per cent of GDP \u2013 a time bo mb ticking away, waiting to explode. Indeed, the RBI warned of the danger posed by the burgeoning current account deficit in its monetary policy statements of 2011 -12 and 2012 -13, but with the intoxicating surges of capital inflows of that time, these warn ings went unheeded.   In hindsight, it was a crisis waiting for i gnition . That was provided in May 2013  when the Fed eral Reserve (Fed) hinted at the possibility of normalising monetary policy later in the year. Financial markets were rudely jolted out of th e complacency that the Fed\u2019s quantitative e asing (QE)  had spread  since 2009 . Foreign capital started  frantically herding at exits  out of  emerging market economies (EMEs) to  scramble  for safe haven. Currencies, yields  and equities were roiled as investors fled out of EMEs  \u2013 perceived as risky asset classes \u2013 and contagion claimed one economy after another. In particular, they lost faith in five emerging economies  \u2013 Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, South Africa , and India. The ep ithet \u2013 the \u201cfragile five \u201d \u2013 entered the lexicon of financial markets. 6  Inflation had perniciously attacked the Indian economy in more ways than one. What started out as a dose of food inflation had eventually morphed into a balance of payments crisis. Mon etary policy was subjected to its most severe challenge \u2013  the evaporation of credibility. The time for reform had arrived unannounced and was demanding immediate attention.   III. Building the Institutional Framework   The immediate response of the g overnment and the RBI was to arrest the deterioration in the external accounts. Buffering up the reserves, restricting gold imports, tightening domestic liquidity t o push up market interest rates \u2013  much has been written about the 2013 defence of the econom y, and visceral memories of that  turmoil  remain. But, it was a time for soul searching  \u2013 something rather basic was broke and needed to be fixed. The pledge of good governance and macroeconomic management to the people had taken a body blow and had to be r e-built. Early on , it was clear that a fundamental change was due, something that would shake up the system and unsettle the ruling orthodoxy, something that would require an amendment to the RBI Act. Accordingly, starting in 2014, the RBI embarked upon bu ilding stone by stone \u2013  though not necessarily in chronological order \u2013  the institutional pl inth for a new monetary policy framework.  In September 2013 , an Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework  was set up . The Expert Committee's recommendations provided the intellectual edifice on which the new framework would rest. It was an internally consistent model, complete in itself, ranging from the goal(s) of monetary policy; the instrument rule that would guide th e policy maker\u2019 s pursuit of the goal; the operating procedure; the transmission; and the international dimensions of monetary policy. It drew heavily on work accumulated before it and broke new ground as well.   7 The consumer price index , the official metric  for gauging inflation , struck a chord with households and consumers  by capturing price changes at the retail level , unlike the WPI which is closer to a producer price index or at least , it reflects  wholesale price changes and t ells households about inflat ion measured before it reache s them. Moreover, the WPI was until January 2012 a weekly index comprising 676 items. Price relatives were not always available or collected and often they were just repeated2. All this w as easier said than done . The public had  for long been used to the RBI articulating inflation concerns in terms of the WPI under a multiple indicator based monetary policy framework . In January 2015 , a new all India consumer price index had been constructed with 2012 as its base. The problem for the RBI was, however, that it had never reacted to CPI inflation before. Consequently, the responsiveness of CPI inflation to policy impulses was unknown. There was no way to calibrate policy actions. The anointment of headline CPI inflation as  the offici al measure of inflation was a brave move in another significant aspect -  almost half of the CPI basket was food! The Indian economy has had a long history of being buffeted  by food shocks which exhibit persistence and spillovers. Supply shocks cannot be wi thin the remit of monetary policy. The RBI took the view that although the first incidence of a food shock is  outside the purview of monetary policy, second round effects such as on inflation expectations and especially, spillovers impacting the rest of in flation  are! It also judged that headline CPI inflation is more easily communicated than an exclusion measure stripped of its most salient components.  The RBI set out a glide path for bringing down inflation from its peak of 11.5 per cent in November 2013  towards more conscionable levels , abjuring a big bang in order to minimise output losses of disinflation. Within this path, it set up self- imposed targets \u2013 8 per cent by the end of 2014; 6 per cent by end -2015 and 5 per cent by end -2016. These targets we re achieved  with a large measure of good luck (the collapse of international commodity price s in 2014; geometric averaging in the new CPI ) but                                                  2 The WPI has a low weight for food items, which i s not in sync with consumption patterns  of households.  It does not includes services.  Price relatives are drawn from a mix of markets, but primarily from bulk sale markets where ordinary consumer do not shop.  8 perhaps fortune  favour s the brave! This was the backdrop against which t he MPC set about its work. It was destined to co nfront a growth -inflation balance on the razor\u2019s edge over the year ahead amid st heightened uncertainty.    IV. The Year Gone By   The first year of the MPC\u2019s functioning would be a tumultuous one in more ways than one. After several false starts, global demand and trade secured a tenuous foothold in the second half of 2016 and gained traction through the first half of 2017. Financial markets were churned by political events , though . In November 2016, the US presidential elections stampeded capital flows out of  EMEs and a surge of the US dollar triggered siz eable depreciations in currencies around the world. Again in January 2017, the \u2018Brexit\u2019 roadmap and expectations of fiscal expansionism by the new US administration propelled the US dollar to a multi -year high. As 2017 progressed, reflation trade lifted equ ity markets, hardened bond yields and returned capital flows to emerging markets. The US dollar\u2019s bull  run lost steam by mid -March ; in fact, it weakened right through early September,  while EME currencies traded with an appreciating bias. By late September, however, there was a complete reversal. The US dollar clawed back lost ground with the announcement of Fed balance sheet normalisation  and tensions around North Korea. Capital outflows from EME equity markets gathered pace. For India, an improvement in e xternal sector viability occurred despite these global developments. Generally buoyant capital inflows buffered up the foreign exchange reserves.   What would challenge the MPC throughout the year was the  domestic dilemma \u2013  the trade -off between inflation and growth was set to become sharp and the tension between the two so acute  that it would eventually impact the voting pattern of the MPC . Shortly, I am going to focus exclusively on the trials and tribulations facing the MPC in this crucial balancing act;  for a moment, however, let me introspect on the RBI.    9 At the time of the MPC\u2019s first meeting a year ago, the RBI itself was caught up in the throes of leadership change \u2013  the twenty -fourth Governor had just assumed office ; the Deputy Governor responsible  for monetary policy had not yet been appointed , and the senior- most Deputy Governor had to step in to complete the six -member MPC. Also, the RBI had been working with the convivial guidance of a technical advisory committee since 2005. The more formal pro cesses associated with an MPC had to be literally tailored from the cross -country experience to adapt to the country -specifics. What emerged was quite a unique sequence of institutional procedures informed heavily by internal management information systems .  As the MPC set about its first meeting, the accommodative cycle of monetary policy in India that commenced in January 2015 was maturing , with the policy rate having been reduced by a cumulative 150 basis points  already . Yet, the ground underneath was moving. Macroeconomic and liquidity conditions were about to undergo tectonic shifts. The combination of a stronger than usual seasonal spike in vegetable prices, highly elevated pulses prices and international crude prices  firming up from a recent trough , veered inflation up from its projected path during April -July 2016, even as growth slowed. In the August CPI reading \u2013 which was the first print that became available to the MPC \u2013  a glimpse of the forming vortex was reveal ed. With a suddenness that overturned the April -July surge, inflation fell off a cliff as the prices of vegetables and pulses sank into deflation!   In these challenging circumstances, the MPC prognosticated inflation developments as \u201c\u2026a downward shift in t he momentum of food inflation \u2013  which holds the key to future inflation outcomes\u2026 .\u201d This assessment would turn out to be prophetic! On the hope that the satisfactory monsoon and cautious business optimism would quicken growth in the window of opportunity t hat the lull in inflation opened up, the MPC voted unanimously for a reduction of 25 basis points in the policy rate . This took the cumulative rate reduction to 175 basis points in this phase of easing . In this meeting, the MPC maintain ed an accommodative policy stance.  10 Just a month later, demonetisation  \u2013 which involved withdrawal of about 87  per cent of the outstanding stock of currency from circulation , setting off a sudden liquidity explosion in the system \u2013  altered monetary conditions drastically. Ove r the next few months, the pangs of currency exchange preoccupied the nation, but when the definitive history of that time is documented, the RBI\u2019s valiant defence of financial stability , right  from the morning after,  will hopefully receive its due. As the  withdrawn currency notes were returned by the public, deposits flooded into banks and swamped them with idle reserves. A wall of liquidity started moving through financial markets, threatening to take down everything in its path \u2013  interest rates; yields; exchange rates; asset prices. Standing alone between the ocean of liquidity and financial chaos, the RBI mounted an extraordinary liquidity absorption strategy. It combined unconventional instruments with regular operations when the liquidity tsunami was s o overwhelming that it could have completely depleted the RBI\u2019s stock of government securities that are used as collateral in reverse repo auctions. In order to tide over the delay in obtaining market stabilisation scheme securities from the government, th e incremental cash reserve ratio (ICRR) was deployed and for the first time in the RBI\u2019s history, an ICRR of the size of 100 per cent of the relevant demand and time liabilities of banks was applied.   These austere conditions weighed ponderously upon the MPC's meetings in December 2016, February  and April 2017. Ab initio , the MPC recognised that its assessment of underlying conditions will likely be clouded by demonetisation effects that were unfolding in the form of transient disruption of cash -intensive segments of the economy, an abrupt compression of demand, restrained discretionary spending and fire sales of perishables that would reduce inflation temporarily. Accordingly, it decided \u2013 unanimously again \u2013  to look through these 'transitory but unclear e ffects' that were influencing the outlook disproportionately. It kept the policy rate unchanged  through these meetings , but noting that inflation excluding food and fuel was  setting a floor to headline inflation by exhibiting downward  inflexibility . The MP C also worried that global financial market spillovers could impact macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets . Accordingly , it changed the policy stance from 11 accommodative to neutral in its February meeting. Importantly, the MPC renewed its commitment t o the inflation target of 4 per cent. In keeping with this stance, the RBI refined its liquidity management framework in its April meeting, inter alia  narrowing the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) corridor to +/ -25 basis points (from +/ -50 basis points  earlier)  to ensure a finer alignment of the weighted average call money rate, the operating target of monetary policy, with the policy rate.   Three features distinguish these meetings of the MPC. First, it was assailed by the criticism of large one -sided inflation forecast errors right up to the June inflation print, which turned out to be a historic low. Demonetisation was readily available to denou nce. Yet, the collapse in inflation occurred from August  2016 , well before demonetisation , which  could have accentuated it transitorily  during November 2016-January 2017. The cumulative deviation of 80 basis points between actual inflation and forecasts be tween August 2016 and June 2017 was entirely due to th e twin deflation  of vegetable and pulses prices that produced a trend shift, holding a mirror to serious errors in food management which would later ignite wide -spread farmers\u2019 unrest. In this context, the MPR of October 2017 stated:  \u201cThese developments may warrant a reappraisal of the scope and quality of food management strategies that seem prone to failure in the face of shocks in either direction. In the past too, supply shocks, of which large one -sided deviations of inflation from projections are merely a symptom, drove disinflation episodes.\u201d In the rush to pillory the scapegoat, attention was diverted from the real issues and consequently, from the right fixes.  Second, there was an overwhelming p reference to wait out the transitory effects of demonetisation. Although today , it appears the logical decision to take, markets were taken by surprise  by the neutral stance and sentiment turned bearish. At the cost of a hawkish tone, the MPC was striving to anchor expectations in a situation when even the near- term was a step in the dark. Third, the decisions of the MPC in these meetings were taken by unanimity, although driven by individualistic approaches. The MPR of April 2017 surveyed the recent countr y experience and found many decisions  taken by unanimity. Where differences were revealed, they were typically confined to 12 the size of the change in the policy rate rather than contesting the overarching policy stance.  The June and August meetings of the MPC were different from the three that preceded them, being literally on the horns of the growth -inflation dilemma. Although inflation had firmed up a bit in February and March, its abrupt and significant retreat in April caused the MPC to lower the forecast path of inflation for 2017 -18 from 4.5 per cent in H1 and 5 per cent in H2 to 2 -3.5 per cent in H1 and 3.5 -4.5 pe r cent in H2 in its June meeting. It unambiguously pointed out that \u201cprices of pulses are clearly reeling under the impact of a supply glut caused by record output and imports. Policy interventions, including access to open trade, may be envisaged to arres t the slump in prices.\u201d Abundant supply, coupled with the renege on procurement by designated agencies, resulted in the market price of pulses falling sharply below minimum support prices fixed by the government. Nonetheless, the MPC did express misgivings  about the durability of the unusually low momentum of inflation, the likelihood of petrol and diesel prices rising , and the possibility that the stickiness of inflation excluding food and fuel would re -assert itself soon. It also indicated that the transi tory effects of demonetisation have \u2018lingered on in price formations\u2019 and warned that \u2018premature action at this stage risks disruptive policy reversals later and the loss of credibility.\u2019 Importantly, the MPC prognosis of economic activity also reflected i ts concern about a deeper than initially anticipated loss of momentum . It underscored the urgency around reviving private investment, restoring banking sector health and removing infrastructural bottlenecks all of which were outside the purview of monetary  policy but would greatly enhance its effectiveness. For the first time, the MPC voted to keep the policy rate unchanged not by unanimity but by a five -member majority, as the scars left by falling growth and inflation set up conflicting pulls.  In the August meeting, the MPC saw for the first time the impact of the implementation of the house rent allowance (HRA) for central government employees for which it had been preparing the public for some time, especially the need to distinguish between \u2018statistical\u2019 and second round effects. The former would merely 13 push up the index without actual inflation, while the latter would warrant careful monitoring for evidence of generali sation. The MPC observed that some upside risks to inflation had reduced \u2013  inflation excluding the HRA impact would likely be only a little above 4 per cent by Q4; inflation excluding food and fuel ha d fallen significantly over the past three months \u2013  but underlying growth imp ulses in industry and services were weakening, given c orporate deleveraging and the retrenchment of investment demand. In fact, growth projections for 2016 -17 and 2017- 18 had been revised down by a cumulative 70 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively (in its October 2017 meeting, the MPC would revise it down even further, as I will shortly bring out , and the cumulative downward adjustment would be 70 basis points for each year).  Seizing the space that had opened up for some accommodation, the MPC decided to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis poin ts but with a neutral stance . In order to derive the maximum effects of the rate cut, it reiterated the  urgent need to revive private investment, remove infrastructure bottlenecks, resolve stress in corporate balance sheets and recapitalise public sector b anks to help restart credit flows. This time around, the vote was carried by a four- member majority , and the divergence in voting preference was two -sided \u2013 one member voted  for status quo while another voted for a rate cut by 50 bps.    V. The Fourth Bi -Monthly Monetary Policy, 2017 -18 The monetary policy statement o f October 2017  was framed in quite a dramatic setting. Even as growth broadened globally, it slowed below 6 per cent for the second quarter in a row in India in April -June. At this rate, India was  still among the fastest growing large economies of the world, but the blow from the growth print  was significant enough to set off a chorus of alarm.   The slowdown was essentially located in manufacturing activity which slumped to a 20-quarter low. Over the recent few years, industrial output  has shown synchronicity across geographies, with trade being identified as the channel of co -movement. In th e early part of 2017 -18, however, Indian industry has been an outlier, decelerating just when industrial production the world over is on the mend. Transient disruptions 14 associated with the GST rollout are likely operating as a drag. Nonetheless, it is fair to say that the nation is impatient to see a revival in industry, especially as capital formation stag ed a modest recovery.   Sharpening the dilemma for the MPC, retail inflation rose nearly  200 basis points since its last meeting. The upturn was broad -based, provoking households to expect that the general level of prices would increase by more than the current rate in the months ahead. Input costs facing both farms and firms rose, but weak pricing power in conditions of subdued demand prevented a fuller- blown pass -through into retail inflation.   In the MPC\u2019s assessment, inflation will likely rise from current levels in the rest of the year, with farm loan waivers and the implementations of pay and allowance revisions by states a la  the centre  posing upside risks. The MPC also pensively expressed concern about the spectres of geopolitical tensions and imminent normalisation of systemic central bank balance sheets that loomed over the outlook. On food inflation, the MPC\u2019s prognosis was more sang uine though, with adequate foodstocks and supply management efforts seen as mitigating factors.   On growth, the MPC regarded  the first estimates of kharif  production \u2013 which were lower than last year\u2019s level and the target for this year \u2013  and the GST roll out as early but transitory setbacks. It believe d that agricultural activity will improve from here on. Furthermore, it found b usiness optimism expressed by firms about prospects for the October -December quarter reassuring. Relative to its August assessmen t, the MPC lowered its growth forecast by 60 basis points which, in a rough and ready sense, measures the net lagged impact of shocks such as demoneti sation and the GST.    The MPC expressed the view that recent structural reforms would support growth over the medium -term. Accordingly, it expected upsides to the growth forecast from the resolution of GST -related impediments and from the pay and allowance revision 15 for state government employees, while the hardening of input costs and the loss of consumer confidence would balance the risks.   The MPC was particularly candid in drawing out the bottom line: \u201c\u2026it is imperative to reinvigorate investment activity.\u201d For this, creation of a conducive environment for investment is critical, involving adequate recapitali sation of stressed banks, closing the infrastructure gap, simplifying the GST, hastening clearances and rationalis ing procedures  by states relating to investment proposals.  Against this backdrop of its appraisal of the evolution of macroeconomic  and financial conditions, the MPC decided to hold the policy rate unchanged and to maintain a neutral policy stance. In the reactions that followed, there seemed a central tendency that the MPC may have called right.   V. Concluding Remarks    I hope my thoughts on the recent monetary policy engagement have provided some clarity on the challenges confronting the MPC and the rationale underlying its decision s. Monetary policy is ultimately the art or science of the feasible. Ben Bernanke, when he was chairma n of the Federal Reserve Board, was once asked by Liaquat Ahmed , the author of the celebrated book Lords of Finance , as to how confident he was that the theory of quantitative easing or QE would work. His reply \u2013  \u201cThe problem with QE is it works in practic e but it doesn't work in theory\" \u2013 provoked laughter, but it  is so true of monetary policy more generally. Monetary policy decision making is always complex and severely testing. It is typically undertaken in an explosion of diverse views, each differing from the other in expressing intensity and fervour. The endeavour of  our MPC has been to try to share with the public through its r esolution s and through individual minutes a set of balanced assessments so  that monetary policy in India becomes transparent and predictable. Looking ahead, the task of the MPC is cut out and I can do no better than quote Governor Dr. Patel from his recent interview: \u201cwe should aim at achieving the inflation target without losing sight of supporting economic growth.\u201d  ", "16 Nov 17 MP.pdf": "1  Monetary Transmission in India:  Why is it important and why hasn\u2019t it worked well? - Dr. Viral V Acharya, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India Inaugural Aveek Guha Memorial Lecture  Thursday 16th November 2017  Homi Bhabha Auditorium  Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR)  When I travel from my residence in Vile Parle (W) to the Reserve Bank of India Central Office in Fort, I pass each way Kenilworth  \u2013 the birth place of late Homi Jehangir Bhabha. It is a good way to start and end the day, being reminded not just of his immense intellect but also of his deep sense of service to India.  I am thus grateful to Professor Dipan Ghosh, who was the Dean of S tudents during my time at IIT Bombay, for inviting me to speak today in the Homi Bhabha Auditorium, and to Dr Subhendu Guha, for having endowed this lecture series at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in memory of his dear son, Aveek Guha. \u201cAveek,\u201d a beautiful Bengali name meaning \u201cfearless\u201d, is exactly how all research needs to be, taking on seemingly insurmountable challenges, fighting it out with grit, and along the way, dissecting, reflecting, and distilling truth to its essence until it  is unearthed in some recognizable form from beneath its scratchy exterior. The TIFR is a daunting proposition for any researcher to speak at. I hope that I can progress some way towards meeting its highest standards in the form of this talk, by raising an issue that is  germane to all of us in today\u2019s forum  and that is worthy  of being tackled in due course \u2013 that of, Monetary Transmission in India: Why is it important and why hasn\u2019t it worked well?   Let me start with some technical jargon and then explain from first principles the part of it I wish to focus on. With the amendment of the Reserve Bank of India Act in 2016, the \u201cprimary objective of the monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth\u201d. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) constituted under the amended RBI Act is mandated to determine the policy repo r ate to achieve the specified medium- term inflation target  of 4 per cent , within a band of +/ - 2 per cent . For the Reserve Bank to achieve its mandate effectively , it is extremely important that an economic process referred to as \u201cmonetary transmission \u201d works seamlessly. Any impediment to this process of monetary transmission  hamper s the achievement of our mandate. We, therefore, monitor and 2  analyse monetary  transmission on a regular basis, and undertake corrective steps to enhance its efficacy , if it seems broken or critically imperfect . What is monetary transmission?  It is essentially the process through which the policy action of  the central bank  is transmitted to the ultimate objective of stable inflation and growth. The policy action consists typically of changing the interest rate at which it borrows or lends \u201creserves\u201d (in our case, Rupees) on an overnight basis with commercial banks . In other words, monetary transmission is t he entire process starting from the change in the policy rate by the central bank to various money market rates  such as inter -bank lending rates, to bank deposit  rates, to bank lending rates  to households and firms , to government and corporate bond yields, and to asset prices such as stock prices and house prices,  culminating in its impact on inflation  and growth. The transmission mechanism hinges crucially on how monetary policy changes influence households \u2019 and firms \u2019 behaviour. This change can take place through several channels.  Studying these channels  is a vast subject  in finance and economics literature . Therefore, given the time constraint , I will only cover  a few key aspects.  I will then explain how  and why monetary transmission has , and more importantly, has not , worked in India , and touch also briefly upon how we could improve  it. Channels  of Monetary Transmission:   Changes in the central bank\u2019s policy rate impact the economy with lags through a variety  of channels , the primary ones being (i) interest rate  channel , (ii) credit channel , (iii) exchange rate channel , and (iv) asset price channel .  Let us start with how  the interest rate channel  works. The immediate impact of a change in the monetary policy rate is on the short- term money market rates (such as call money rate, certificates of deposits, commercial papers, treasury bills) , key financial market s (exchange rate, equity prices) , and also on medium and long- term instruments (yields on dated government securities and corporate bonds). The impact is typically quick and broadly one-to-one from the policy rate to short -term money markets rates such as the call money rate  which is the unsecured or uncollateralized inte r-bank lending rate: A bank will be willing to part with its reserves overnight to another bank only if it earns at least the rate that it could earn by parking these funds with the central bank; and, if banks compete adequately for such lending, then the rate will in fact track closely the central bank\u2019s policy rate. T he impact  of 3  the policy rate  on other ma rket rates varies across tenors and instruments  depending upon the liquidity conditions and other  factors  such as how interest rates vary at different maturities.  In turn, the  central bank \u2019s changes in its policy rate  are expected to impact the banks\u2019 cost of funds , both the rates they would pay to depositors  and the rates they would demand for making loans . For example, when a central bank reduce s the policy repo rate  with the intention  to support  aggregate  demand in the economy, the expectation is that there would be a reduction in the banks\u2019 cost of funds  and lending rates , and in the spectrum of market interest rates (and vice versa  when the policy rate is increased) . Lower lending interest rates of banks  provide a boost to demand for bank credit from various segments of the society, for instance, from individuals and households for loans for consumer durables ( such as automobiles ) and for housing;  and from entrepreneurs for new or increased investment in plant and machinery . An increased demand for automobiles, housing, and machinery generate s increased demand for the inputs including labour in these industries , and hence , an increase in overall demand, incomes , and output in the economy. As t his process continues, it eventually puts upward pressure on wages of labor and prices  of inputs , and this way, raise s inflation.   A cen tral bank mandated to maintain stable prices while taking account of growth thus faces a trade -off while lowering or raising its policy rate.  The implicit assumption here is that bank balance sheets are strong and in a position to step -up quickly the supply of credit in response to lower funding cost and higher demand for credit \u2013  the bank lending or the credit channel  of transmission. Cross -country evidence indicates that monetary transmissi on is greatly hindered if bank balance sheets are weak  in that they do not have much loss -absorption capacity to deal squarely with their problem loans  \u2013 indeed, the evidence suggests that there might be ever -greening of bad loans, and increased \u2018zombie\u2019 lending, lending to distressed firms at  subsidized rates to kick the can of loan defaults down the road, resulting in misallocation of resources, productivity losses and weak growth.  This way, a ttempts to stimulate growth with aggressive policy rate cuts when there are bank balance -sheet problems get wasted and can even backfire in the form of mal -investments, creatin g false hopes of a growth boost  and relaxing the pedal on deeper balance -sheet and structural reforms  of the banking sector .1 The effectiveness of this bank credit channel is a critical issue in the current juncture in India to which I will come back later.                                                               1 Acharya, V.V., T. Eisert, C. Eufinger, and C.W. Hirsch (2016), \u2018 Whatever it Takes: The Real Effects of Unconventional Monetary Policy \u2019, Working Paper, New York University Stern School of Business.  4    Lower interest rates also boost asset prices such as housing and equity prices as these can now be purchased at cheaper borrowing costs . The resulting boost to household / corporate wealth and improved cash flows on the back of lower interest rates also add to the demand impulses . This is  the asset price channel  of monetary transmission. Higher asset prices can enha nce the value of the collateral or net worth of the borrowers, interacting with the bank lending or credit channel, enhancing the  capacity to borrow more and at competitive rates, reinforcing the impulses to aggregate demand.  Finally, lower domestic interest rates could lead to a depreciation of the domestic currency, on the one hand making exports more competitive in the global market and adding to domestic demand and economic activity , but on the other hand, could also have a  direct upward impact on the domestic currency prices of imported inputs , making imports (for example, crude oil) costlier . This is the exchange rate channel  of transmission.  All the channels that I have described above \u2013 the interest  rate channel, the bank lending or credit channel, the asset price channel, and the exchange rate channel \u2013 are not  stand alone channels; rather, these work at the same time, and may reinforce  or interact with  each other, so that  their individual impact is difficult to disentangle. I t also needs to be recognised that the tr ansmission mechanism is complex. The speed and strength at which the central bank\u2019s policy rate changes travel to the rest of the economy could vary widely from  country to country depending on the structure of the economy and the state of its financial system.  Monetary Policy Lags   The available empirical evidence for India suggests that monetary policy actions are felt with a lag of 2 -3 quarters on output and with a lag of 3 -4 quarters on inflation , and the impact persists for 8 -12 quarters. Among the channels of transmission, the interest rate  channel  has been found to be the strongest.2 Given that monetary policy impacts output and inflation with long (and of ten variable) lags, it is critical for monetary policy actions to be forward -looking, i.e., monetary policy needs to respond to expected  output and inflation                                                                                                                                                                                           2 Report of the Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework  (Chairman: Urjit R. Patel), 2014,  Reserve Bank of India. The lags of 2 -4 quarte rs that I just noted are the average lags over the sample periods of various studies, and the actual lags at any given point of time could be vastly different from these average lags, depending upon factors such as the stage of the domestic and the global business cycle, the domestic liquidity and financial conditions, the fiscal stance, the health of the domestic banking sector and the non-banking sector.  5  developments. Of course, the expected evolution of output and inflation is uncertain, thereby rendering the transmission  analysis even more challenging,  adding to the complexity of the  central bank\u2019s decision -making (and creating exciting opportunities for its critiques!). The key point is that if parts of the transmission machinery are broken, then monetary policy would be less effective.   Transmission from Policy Rate to Bank Lending Rates  in India : Performance  The Indian financial system remains bank- dominated, though the share of non- bank finance companies (N BFCs) and markets (corporate bonds, commercial paper, equity, etc.)  in overall financing of the economy is steadily rising.  Hence, the overall efficacy of monetary transmission in India hinges critically on the extent and the pace with which banks , taking a cue from  \u2013 and induced by \u2013  the changes in the policy repo rate , adjust  their deposit and lending rates  and meet adequatel y the economy\u2019s demand for credit . Overall, data suggests  that the pass -through from policy rate changes to bank lending rates has been slow and muted . This lack of adequate monetary transmission  remains a key policy concern for the Reserve Bank  as it blunts the impact of its policy changes on economic activity and inflation.  Since the deregulation of interest rates in the early 1990s, the Reserv e Bank  has made several attempts to improve the speed and extent of the monetary pass -through by refining the process of setting lending interest rates by banks, while at the same time imparting  transparency to borrowers and flexibility to banks in the process of in terest rate setting . We have transited from the prime lending rate (PLR)  system (1994) to the benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR)  system (2003) , the base rate  system (2010) , and the present marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR)  system (2016) . Let me explain these interest rate setting regimes briefly , before I turn to an assessment of the performance of the (legacy) Base Rate and  (prevalent) MCLR system s. In India, as in a number of other countries, a large proportion of loans is at floating rates, i.e., the interest rate charged to the borrower keeps changing depending on the reset period icity. The floating rate is linked to some \u201cbenchmark rate\u201d (which id eally varies over time in consonance with the changing macroeconomic and financial conditions and, in particular, the central bank\u2019s policy rat e). Banks also charge a spread over the benchmark to factor in term premia and credit risk, among other  factor s. The actual lending rate is the benchmark plus the spread. The benchmark could be internal  or external ; an internal 6  benchmark will be based on elements which are in part under the control of the bank such as cost of funds, while an external benchmark is outside the control of the bank (for example, it could be market determined rate such as Certificate of Deposit rate or T reasury B ill rate or Inter -Bank Offer Rate, or  it could simply be  the central bank\u2019s policy rate).  The v irtue of a n external benchmark is t hat it is transparent, common across banks, and borrowers can compare various loan offers by simply comparing spreads over the benchmark (all else, such as maturity of the loan, being equal). As market rates normally move  in line with the central bank\u2019s policy rate, an external benchmark is globally considered and adopted as more appropriate than an internal benchmark for transmitting monetary policy signals.  In India, the Reserve Bank has provided the banks flexibility to  use both the internal and external benchmarks, but the banks seem to have preferred internal benchmarks over external benchmarks on two key grounds: first, the internal benchmark reflects their cos t of funds, and second, it has been perceived that there h ave not been until recently  any robust and vibrant external benchmark s.  In October 1994, when the Reserve Bank deregulated lending rates for credit limits over ` 2 lakh, banks were required to declare their prime lending rates (PLR) -  the interest rate charged for the most creditworthy borrowers -  taking into account factors such as cost of funds and transaction costs. The PLR was, thus, expected to act as a floor for lending above ` 2 lakh.  However, the experience with its working was not satisfactory mainly for two reasons: (i) both the PLR and the spread charged over the PLR varied widely, and inexplicably so, across banks; and  perhaps more importantly, (ii) the PLRs of banks were rigid and inflexible in relation to the overall direction of interest rates in the economy.  In view of these concerns, the Reserve Bank advised banks in April 2003 to announce Benchmark PLRs (BPLRs) , taking into account the cost of funds , operational costs, minimum margin to cover regulatory requirements (provisioning and capital charge), and profit margin. The BPLR system also fell short of its desired objective of enhancing transparency and serving as the reference rate for pricing of loan products , with a large part of the lending taking place at interest rates below the announced BPLRs. The share of sub -BPLR lending was as high as 77 per cent in September 2008, rendering it difficult to assess the transmission of policy rate changes of the Reserve Bank to lending rates of banks. The residential housing loans and the consumer durable loans were outside the purview of the BPLR. As such, sub-7  BPLR lending became a major distortion in terms of cross -subsidisation across borrower categories.  Next, t he drawbacks of the BPLR system led to the introduction of the base rate system in July 2010. The base rate was also based , inter alia , on the costs of borrowed funds ; an indicative formula for arriving at the base rate was also provided. The base rate was to be the minimum rate for all loans  (except for some specified categories)  with t he actual lending rate charged to the borrowers being the base rat e plus borrower -specific charge or spread . In practice, the flexibility accorded to banks in the de termination of cost of funds \u2013 average, marginal or blended cost \u2013 caused opacity in the determination of lending rates by banks and clouded an accurate assessment of the speed and strength of the transmission. Moreover, banks often adjusted the spread ove r the base rate to benefit the new borrowers  while leaving the transmission through the base rate weak for existing borrowers . The weaknesses and rigidities observed with the transmission under the base rate system led to the present system, i.e., the MCLR system effective April 1, 2016. With banks required to determine their benchmark lending rates taking into account the marginal  cost of funds [unlike the base rate system where banks had the discretion to choose between the average  cost or the marginal cost (or blended cost) of funds] , lending rates were expected to be more sensitive to the changes in the policy rate under the MCLR system vis- \u00e0-vis its predecessor (the base rate). The actual lending rate is based on MCLR plus a spread (business strategy and credit risk premium ). The base rate system was allowed to be in operation concomitantly for the loans already contracted, pending their maturity or a shift to the MCLR system at mutually agreeable terms between the bank and the bo rrower.   The expected benefits of the MCLR system \u2013 better transparency, more flexibility and faster transmission \u2013 have , however, continued to elude as documented in the Reserve Bank\u2019s recent study - \u201cReport of the Internal Study Group to Review the Working of the Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate System \u201d (Chairman: Dr. Janak Raj), the analysis wherein indicate s that the transmission:  \u2022 has been slow and incomplete  under both the base rate and the MCLR  systems, although it has improved  since November 2016 under the pressure of large surplus liquidity in the system post demonetisation  (Table 1 ).  \u2022 was significant  on fresh loans , but muted for  outstanding loans  (base rate and MCLR).  8  \u2022 was uneven across borrowing categories .  \u2022 was asymmetric over monetary policy cycles \u2013 higher during the tightening phase and lower during the easing phase  \u2013 irrespective of the interest rate system.3   Transmission from Policy Rate to Bank Lending Rates: Some Issues  What explains the slow and incomplete pass -through from the policy rate changes to the lending rates? Two broad factors  have dampened transmission to the lending rates.  First, a sizeable legacy l oan portfolio of banks is still linked to the base rate (about 30 per cent of the outstanding bank loans). Lending rates under the base rate system are relatively stickier than the  loans linked to MCLR. During the current easing cycle of monetary policy, as against 200 bps cumulative cut in the repo rate, the base rate has declined                                                             3 For instance, the pass -through to outstanding loans from the repo rate was around 60 per cent during the tightening phase (July 2010 to March 2012), while it was less than 40 per cent during the subsequent easing phase (April 2012 to June 2013)   Table 1: Transmission from the Policy Repo Rate to Banks\u2019 Deposit and Lending Rates   (Variation in percentage points)  Period  Repo Rate  Term Deposit Rates  Lending Rates  Median Term Deposit Rate  WADTDR  Median Base Rate  Median  MCLR (1 -year)  WALR - Outstanding Rupee Loans  WALR - Fresh Rupee Loans  October 2017 over end-December 2014  -2.00 -1.66 -1.99 -0.75 * -1.39 -1.92 October 2017 over April 1, 2016  -0.75 -0.94 -1.08 -0.15 -1.15 -0.75 -0.94 Memo:  Pre-Demonetisation  January 2015 to October 2016  -1.75 -0.99 -1.26 -0.61 * -0.75 -0.97  April 1, 2016 to  October 2016  -0.50 -0.27 -0.35 -0.01 -0.15 -0.11 0.01 Post Demonetisation  November 2016 to  October 2017  -0.25 -0.67 -0.73 -0.14 -1.00 -0.64 -0.95 WADTDR: Weighted Average Domestic Term Deposit Rate.

Since the introduction of the MCLR in April 2016, as against the cumulative cut in re po rate by 50 bps, the base rate has declined by just about 20 bps (Chart s 1a and 1b).  The Study Group\u2019s analysis suggested that banks deviated in an ad hoc  manner from the specified methodologies for calculating the base rate and the MCLR to either inflate the base rate and MCLR or prevent the base rate and MCLR from falling in line with the cost of funds.4                                                               4 The ad hoc  adjustments included, inter alia , (i) inappropriate calculation of the cost of funds; (ii) no chan ge in the base rate even as the cost of deposits declined significantly; (iii) sharp increase in the return on net worth out of tune with past track record or future prospects to offset the impact of reduction in the cost of deposits on the lending rate; a nd (iv) inclusion of new components in the base rate formula to adjust the rate to a desired level. The slow transmission to the base rate loan portfolio was further accentuated by the long (annual) reset periods.  5.506.006.507.007.508.008.509.009.5010.0010.50Dec-14Feb-15Apr-15Jun-15Aug-15Oct-15Dec-15Feb-16Apr-16Jun-16Aug-16Oct-16Dec-16Feb-17Apr-17Jun-17Aug-17Oct-17Per cent  Chart 1a: Transmission to  Base Rate and MCLR  1Yr Median MCLR Median base rate Policy Repo Rate10   Second, spreads charged by banks over MCLR were adjusted to offset the changes in MCLR, thereby impacting the overall reduction in lending rates. The  spread over the MCLR could vary from bank to bank due to idiosyncratic factors. However, as the Study Group observed, banks adjusted the spread over the MCLR arbitrarily in several ways  and the variations in the spreads across banks appeared too large to be explained based on bank -level business strategy and borrower -level credit risk.5 The Study Group also observed that w hile the spread over the MCLR was expected to play only a small role in determining the lending rates by banks, it has turned out to be the key element in deciding the overall lending rates . What explains the muted pass- through from policy rate to bank lending rates , either by banks  not changing the benchmark rate or by adjusting the spread ?  One plausible  underlying reason is  the rate rigidity on the liability side  of banks caused by several factors. In India, about 90 per c ent of total liabilities of banks are in the form of deposits. Bank deposits are predominantly at fixed interest rates, thereby imparting rigidity to the transmission process.  Further, over 36 per cent of term deposits of banks have                                                             5 For example, the Study Group found that:  (i) large reduction in MCLR was partly offset by some banks by a simultaneous increase in the spread in the form of business strategy premium ostensibly to reduce the pass -through to lending rates; (ii) there was no documentation of the rationale for fixi ng business strategy premium for various sectors; (iii) many banks did not have a board approved policy for working out the components of spread charged to a customer; (iv) some banks did not have any methodology for computing the spread, which was merely treated as a residual arrived at by deducting the MCLR from the actual prevailing lending rate; and (v) the credit risk element was not applied based on the credit rating of the borrower concerned, but on the historically observed probability of default (P D) and loss given default (LGD) of the credit portfolio/sector concerned.  8.008.509.009.5010.0010.5011.005.50 5.75 6.00 6.25 6.50 6.75 7.00 7.25 7.50 7.75 8.00 8.25MCLR and Base Rate (%)  Policy Repo Rate (%)  Chart 1b : Transmission to Base Rate and MCLR  1-Year Median MCLR Median base rate11  maturity of three years and above (Table -2), imply ing their rates get reset infrequently and with significant lags to policy rate changes. While the banks\u2019 marginal cost of funds may drop quickly with a cut in fresh deposit rates, the average cost of deposits comes down rather slowly, which weakens the tr ansmission, especially in the case of the base rate system.

What is often not recognised is the large access our  banks have to low cost Current and Savings Account ( CASA ) funds . CASA funds constitute about 40 per cent of aggregate bank deposits with the share of saving deposits at around 31 per cent. Importantly, banks are free  to decide  saving deposit interest rates since  October 2011, but unti l recently, most of the banks  chose to  leave the saving deposit rate unchanged, ignoring completely monetary policy signals. For instance, the  major banks kept their saving deposit rate unchanged at 4 per cent between October 2011 and July 2017, even as the Reserve Bank\u2019s policy rate moved significantly over this period  from 8.5 per cent in October 2011 to 7.25 per cent in August 2013. It increa sed again to  8.0 per cent by January 2014, before declin ing to 6.0 per cent by August 2017. Furthermore, the deterioration in banking sector health due to worsening of asset quality over the past 2- 3 years and the expected loan losses in credit portfolios also seem to have induced large variability in spreads in the pricing of assets. With under -capitalized banks aiming to protect their net interest margins6 (NIMs) \u2013 indeed, weak banks\u2019 NIMs have remained broadly unchanged in the face of large stressed assets \u2013 so as to maintain profitability in the short -term even at the expense of long- term profits as well as deposits and lending shares, the transmission to lending rates has been severely impacted. In effect, there                                                             6 Net interest margin is defined as the difference between a bank\u2019s interest income (on its loans and assets) less its interest expenditure (on its deposits and other borrowings).  12  has been a cross- subsidisation of corpora te loan losses by lending rates in healthier sectors  such as in retail .  Finally, t he competition that banks face from alternative instruments of financial savings  \u2013 such as mutual funds and small saving schemes \u2013 also seems to have made banks hesitant in varying the interest rates on term deposits in consonance with policy rate signals . Although bank deposits have some distinct advantages in the form of stable returns ( vis-\u00e0-vis mutual fund schemes) and liquidity ( vis-\u00e0-vis small saving schemes), bank deposits are in a disadvantageous position in terms of tax- adjusted returns in comparison with these schemes.  All of these factors have imparted rigidity to the liability side of banks\u2019 balance sheet  with respect to policy rat e changes, in turn inducing behaviour to make the rates on asset side of banks\u2019 balance sheet rigid too.   Improving Transmission:  The Way Forward  Drawing from its comprehensive analysis, t he RBI\u2019s Study Group has suggested a number of steps to enhance transp arency and transmission from  monetary policy signals to the actual lending rates . Their recommendations pertain to improving transmission based on the existing lending rate  system as well as a fundamental reform of the interest r ate setting process. Let me touch upon the four major recommendation by the Study Group.   In view of the less than desired transmission and transparency under the internal  benchmark based lending rate systems \u2013 PLR, BPLR, base rate and MCLR \u2013 so far, the Study Group has recommended  that there is need to shift to an external  benchmark based lending rate system . The internal benchmark -based pricing regimes are not in sync with global practices on pricing of bank loans . Given the scope of arbitrariness under the MCLR system, the Study Group has recommended that the switchover to an external benchmark needs to be pursued in a time -bound manner. While recognising that no external instrument in India meets all the requirement s of an ideal benchmark , and after analysing the pros and cons of 13 possible candidates, the Study Group has recommended  that the Treasury Bill rate, the Certificate of Deposit (CD) rate, and the Reserve Bank  of India \u2019s policy repo rate are better suited than other interest rates to serve the role of an external benchmark . The Study Group has recommended that all floating rate loans extended beginning April 1, 2018 could be 13  referenced to one of the three external benchmarks selected by the Reserve Bank aft er receiving and evaluating the feedback from stakeholders.  Second, the Study Group has recommended that the decision on the spread over the external benchmark c ould be left to the commercial judgment of banks , with the spread remain ing fixed all through the term of the loan, unless there is a credit event  (as per standardized or ex ante mutually agreed definition of \u201ccredit event\u201d).   Third, the periodicity of resetting the interest rates by banks on all floating rate loans, retail as well as corporate, be reduced from once in a year to once in a quarter to expedite the pass- through from the monetary policy signal to the actual lending rates.   Fourth, to reduce rigidity  on liabilities side, b anks be encouraged to accept deposits, especially bulk deposits , at floating rates linked directly to the selected external benchmark.  The common theme underlying these recommendations  is to improve monetary transmission by ensuring that changes in the policy rate transmit quickly and adequately to banks\u2019 lending rates in a transparent manner without any cross -subsidisation and discrimination between existing and new borrowers. The idea is also to make banks\u2019 liability side more flex ible so that the objectives of improving monetary tr ansmission by the Reserve Bank and maintaining healthy net interest rate margins by banks are aligned.  The report of the Study Group, which was put in the public domain on October 4, 2017 has generated much  interest and extensive feedback to the Reserve Bank from all stakeholders, not only banks, but also general  public and media. We have received a number of useful suggestions and comments on the recommendations of the Study Group. These are being examined carefully  and would help us to take a considered view , factoring in transition costs and providing a calibrated path to the desired benchmarking system .  Improving Monetary Transmission : Shoring up Bank Balance Sheets  As explained earlier, e ven as the Reserve Bank has reduced its policy repo rate by 50 bps since October 2016 and by a cumulative 200  bps since December 2014, the banking sector\u2019s credit grow th has remained much muted. While weak demand for bank credit could be one of the factor s leading to the observed slowdown in credit growth, a primary cause of the slowdown had also been the weak balance sheets of public sector banks in view of large 14  non-performing assets which seem to have made banks risk averse and induced them to reduce the  supply of credit : under -capitalized banks have capital only to survive, not to grow7. The dominance of the supply side factor  has also been  borne out by the fac t that the credit growth of private sector banks (better  asset quality and well -capitalised  on average ) remains robust, whereas there has been a sharp deceleration in the credit growth of public sector banks ( especially the ones with high stressed assets).    Against this backdrop, t he enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in Decembe r 2016, the promulgation of the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance 2017 (since notified as an Act) , and the subsequent actions taken thereunder  in the form of the Reserve Bank requiring banks refer the largest, material and aged non -performing assets  (NPAs) to the IBC , have made the IBC a lynchpin of the new time -bound resolution framework  for bank NPAs .  These initiatives will  now be supported by the Government \u2019s decision to recapitalise public sector banks in a front -loaded manner , with a total allocation of ` 2.1 trillion, comprising budgetary provisions ( ` 181 billion), recapitalisation bonds (` 1.35 trillion), and raising of capital by banks from the market while diluting  government equity share (around ` 580 billion ).  The two steps together \u2013 asset resolution and bank recapitalisation \u2013 are expected to strengthen bank balance sheets significant ly and  improve banks\u2019 ability and willingness  to lend at rates in consonance with policy rates and result in an improve d monetary transmission.  Concluding Observations  In summary, e fficient  monetary transmission  is a sine qua non for the successful pursuit of its objectives by any central bank. Over the past two decades, it has been the endeavour  of the Reserve Bank to strength en the monetary transmission process, but these efforts have yet not yielded the desire d results. The transmission from  the policy repo rate to bank lending rates , which is the dominant transmission channel in India, has remained  a matter of concer n. With the recent explicit objective of price stability mandated by the legislature, the issue of smooth monetary transmission has assumed an added significance.                                                              7Acharya, Viral V (2017), \u201c The Unfinished Agenda: Restoring Public Sector Bank Health in India \u201d, 8th R K Talwar Memorial Lecture.  15  Against this backdrop, we have recently put out a report  by the Internal Study Group to address the weaknesses of the existing monetary transmission system . A key suggestion  before us i s to whether to shift the loan pricing system from an internal benchmark to an exter nal benchmark. The Reserve Bank will take a considered view in the matter at an  appropriate time.  In my view , there is a deeper economic issue at hand in the recommendation to move towards an external benchmark. The issue is: who should bear the interest rate risk  in the economy  \u2013 the borrower, or the depositor , or the bank? Who is likely to be better at managing the interest rate risk? Retail  depositors and borrowers are unlikely to have efficient tools to manage the interest rate risk. Banks, however,  should have the wherewithal to manage interest rate risk . Similarly, bulk deposit ors and large corpo rate borrowers  can also be expected to be in a  position to manage the interest rate risk. Non-bank financial institutions with less exposure to interest rate risk, such as insurance and pension funds, could also be good repositories of t his risk.  Foreign banks may be able to offset interest rate risk globally.  A combination of interest -rate risk transfer mechanisms through market products such as interest -rate derivatives (swaps, in particular) and securitized products such as collatera lized loan obligations (CLOs) will spring about, provided banks indeed have to manage the interest rate risk rather than have it as a matter of convenience to pass it onto borrowers.  Hopefully, I will focus sometime soon on these issues in a companion pie ce - Monetary Transmission in India: How can it be improved?

Exactly a  year ago, a page  was turned on a tradition that went back to the origins of the RBI in pre -independent India. The monetary policy decision, hitherto made solely by the Governor of the RBI, was ceded to a six -member committee  comprising the Governor as the Chairperson, the  Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy, one officer of the RBI appointed by its Central Board, and three external members appointed by the central government.  The room filled with debate and argumentation, challenge and counter- challenge, articulat ions of well -defended individualistic assessments, and voting  \u2013 India's monetary policy was undergoing  a regime change. Quietly ushered in, without any grandeur about it or anything like that, it was a big step towards the modernisation  of the conduct of monetary policy in India.   Invested by legislative mandate \u2013  through an amendment to the RBI Act \u2013  with the goal of 'maintaining price stability keeping in mind the objective of growth', India   joined a select but growing band of countries that, beginning in 199 0, adopted flexible inflation targeting (FIT) as their framework for monetary policy. Under FIT , price stability is accorded primacy as an objective  of monetary policy, while being  mindful of the state of the economy. Accordingly, the target for inflation is to be achieved over a medium term horizon rather than at a point in time to mitigate any                                                   1 The theme of this lecture was inspired by an interview given by Governor Dr. Urjit  R. Patel in the Mint, October 9 , 2017 available at http://www.livemint.com/Industry/Gr9H0MnqAL5Ko4PdGa7fdL/RBI -governor -Urjit -Patel -Weve -started -seeing -the-upturn -in.html .

The usual disclaimers apply.    2 output effect s that disinflation could entail. Furthermore , the target itself is set within a band or range in acknowledgement of potentia l supply shocks that well up outside monetary policy\u2019s realm. Accountability for failure to ensure the inflation band is generally defined , but after taking into account the various lags characterising the operation of monetary policy.    In India, the amended RBI Act defines the metric for the inflation target as the year-on-year change in the monthly consumer price index (CPI). T he numerical inflation target has been  set by the g overnment at four per cent, with an upper tolerance  level of 6 per ce nt and a lower tolerance  level of 2 per cent, internalis ing flexibility. The amended RBI Act has also specified accountability norms for dealing with failure to achieve the inflation target while building in recognition of the lags inherent in the conduct of monetary policy. It defines failure as average inflation breaching  the tolerance band for three consecutive quarters, not instantly. Although concerns about inflation had dominated monetary policy over the past decades in deference to a societal intolerance threshold, such an explicit commitment to a numerical inflation target as the centre -piece of policy had never been made.    It was veritably a baptism by fire for the MPC, the new kid on the block in a cross -country sense of the term. The amendment to  the RBI Act, the inflation target and tolerance band around it , and accountability with respect to failure to achieve the target were notified in the Gazette of India during May-August 2016 . They were widely telegraphed and occupied many media bytes. What  was little noticed , however, was that it was only on September 29, 2016 that  a press release of the Government of India (GoI) informed the world about the  appointment  of the MPC. Just one working day later, the MPC plunged into its work and on October 4, it issued its first resolution, unanimously backed. Many 'firsts' surround that debut .  As the statutory semi -annual Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of October 2016 noted: \u201cFor  the first time in its history, the RBI has been provided the explicit legislative mandate to operate the monetary policy framework of the country. The primary objective of monetary policy has also been d efined for the first time.  The amendments also 3 provide for the constitution of a monetary policy committee that shall determine the policy rate required to achieve the inflation target, another landmark in India's monetary history.\" Each of these milestones warrants a more detailed exposition to catch the inflexions around the turning point s. Indeed, each shall receive its due and enter the pantheon of legend s in my memoirs. In the interest of brevity and time, however, I shall devote the rest of my lecture to ( I) the initial conditions that brought to critical mass the urgency of the regime shift; ( II) the RBI's efforts to build t he institutional architecture  ahead of and to prepare the ground  for FIT; (III) the high wire that electrified the six decisions the MPC took in its formative year; and (IV) the conflicting pulls and trade -offs that shaped the decision of October 4, 2017 \u2013  arguab ly, one of the most testing .   II. The Initial Conditions   Today, the Indian economy basks in macroeconomic stability with a configuration that could be the envy of peers:  a fiscal deficit steadfastly consolidatin g towards a Maastricht- like rendezvous  with a strong con sensus that its quality matters;  inflation below target , shepherded by an MPC committed to the centre of the band notified by government; a current account deficit below 1 per cent of GDP and sustainab le in terms of a dashboard of externa l sector indicators \u2013  overall, a sweet spot by any consideration ! Yet, just four years ago, an ocean of vulnerability engulfed the economy. The situation around the \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d seemed so d ire that even a growth rate of 6.6  per cent and foreign exchange  reserves of close to US $ 3 00 billion seemed like matchsticks before a tide that swept India into the infamous 'fragile five' in that fateful summer of 2013 . In a fundamental way, it was those troubled conditions that provided the impetus for monetary pol icy regime change.  India was among the first nations to rebound from the  global financial crisis , with tailwinds from a fiscal stimulus, the RBI\u2019s policy rate cut cumulatively by 425 basis points and access to potential liquidity from the Reserve Bank expanded to as high as 10 per cent of GDP with a view to keeping financial institutions functional as 4 financial market s seized up . In 2009, g rowth seemed set to accelerate to the aspirational double digits that Indians dream about. Long embarrassed by the parlous state of the physical infrastructure, we set out to build world clas s roads, airports, power supply and ports. T he financial sector w as expected to take a lead role in creating conducive conditions for this big push even, as we have learned painfully, at the risk of much loss of governance and risk control .  There was , however, a  serpent in the garden ! Starting out innocuously in the gu ise of food prices rising on the back of a monsoon failure, inflation reared its ugly head, hidden behind the heady upswing of growth that deceptively appeared  too good to interrupt. The wholesale price index  (WPI), the official metric for measuring inflat ion then, failed to detect it initially \u2013  although the WPI food index rose by c lose to 15 per cent in 2009, headline inflation measured as the year- on-year change in the WPI remained below 4 per cent . It was beguilingly pulled down by the core measure of those days \u2013  WPI non- food manufactured products inflation was close to zero! By contrast, inflation in terms of the consumer price index  for industrial workers (CPI -IW) was raging at above 12 per cent. Spreadi ng incipiently, food inflation became generalised by 2010 -11. The WPI picked it up by then, and spillovers to prices of non-food manufactured products started getting manifested. By the time there was a policy reaction in March 201 0, it was too late. Over the period 2009 -12, inflation averaged 10.4 per cent  measured by  the CPI- IW and 7.4 per cent by the WPI. Thirteen policy rate increases failed to excoriate it . Entrenched now in the system, it began to mutate like a multi- headed Hydra .   Inflation is not j ust the rate of increase  of the price level. It is also considered an index of the quality of governance  and macroeconomic management by the  state which seeks to assure the well -being of its people who have relinquished to it some control over their lives for the greater common good. Indian society is well -known for zero tolerance for double digit inflation. Often in the not too distant past, it has been a  pivotal election  issue and governments have been voted out of office over the price of the lowly onion. In the year 2009 itself, inflation expectations of households a year 5 ahead rose by 400 basis points. By the end of the year, they crossed 12 per cent and kept climbing, entrenched in th ose high reaches. People were completely discounting the possibility of putting the genie back into the bottle. This time around, however, they did not take recourse to the ballot. They did something more sinister \u2013  they bought gold!   As inflation outcomes and expectations climbed, the real rate of return on bank deposits started to get eroded and even turned negative. Saving in financial assets became a losing proposition. So people pulled out their money from bank deposits and other finan cial assets and put it into gold. For India, buying gold is just another conduit of capital flight; only 2 per cent of India's gold demand is mined domestically. Since 2012, India was already the largest consumer of gold. In the troubled years (2009 -12), a n annual average of 700 -800 tonnes of gold imports surged to cross 1000 tonnes. With gold constituting 11 per cent of total imports, the current account deficit began to expand and by the third quarter of 2012 -13, it reached  6.8 per cent of GDP \u2013 a time bo mb ticking away, waiting to explode. Indeed, the RBI warned of the danger posed by the burgeoning current account deficit in its monetary policy statements of 2011 -12 and 2012 -13, but with the intoxicating surges of capital inflows of that time, these warn ings went unheeded.   In hindsight, it was a crisis waiting for i gnition . That was provided in May 2013  when the Fed eral Reserve (Fed) hinted at the possibility of normalising monetary policy later in the year. Financial markets were rudely jolted out of th e complacency that the Fed\u2019s quantitative e asing (QE)  had spread  since 2009 . Foreign capital started  frantically herding at exits  out of  emerging market economies (EMEs) to  scramble  for safe haven. Currencies, yields  and equities were roiled as investors fled out of EMEs  \u2013 perceived as risky asset classes \u2013 and contagion claimed one economy after another. In particular, they lost faith in five emerging economies  \u2013 Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, South Africa , and India. The ep ithet \u2013 the \u201cfragile five \u201d \u2013 entered the lexicon of financial markets. 6  Inflation had perniciously attacked the Indian economy in more ways than one. What started out as a dose of food inflation had eventually morphed into a balance of payments crisis. Mon etary policy was subjected to its most severe challenge \u2013  the evaporation of credibility. The time for reform had arrived unannounced and was demanding immediate attention.   III. Building the Institutional Framework   The immediate response of the g overnment and the RBI was to arrest the deterioration in the external accounts. Buffering up the reserves, restricting gold imports, tightening domestic liquidity t o push up market interest rates \u2013  much has been written about the 2013 defence of the econom y, and visceral memories of that  turmoil  remain. But, it was a time for soul searching  \u2013 something rather basic was broke and needed to be fixed. The pledge of good governance and macroeconomic management to the people had taken a body blow and had to be r e-built. Early on , it was clear that a fundamental change was due, something that would shake up the system and unsettle the ruling orthodoxy, something that would require an amendment to the RBI Act. Accordingly, starting in 2014, the RBI embarked upon bu ilding stone by stone \u2013  though not necessarily in chronological order \u2013  the institutional pl inth for a new monetary policy framework.  In September 2013 , an Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework  was set up . The Expert Committee's recommendations provided the intellectual edifice on which the new framework would rest. It was an internally consistent model, complete in itself, ranging from the goal(s) of monetary policy; the instrument rule that would guide th e policy maker\u2019 s pursuit of the goal; the operating procedure; the transmission; and the international dimensions of monetary policy. It drew heavily on work accumulated before it and broke new ground as well.   7 The consumer price index , the official metric  for gauging inflation , struck a chord with households and consumers  by capturing price changes at the retail level , unlike the WPI which is closer to a producer price index or at least , it reflects  wholesale price changes and t ells households about inflat ion measured before it reache s them. Moreover, the WPI was until January 2012 a weekly index comprising 676 items. Price relatives were not always available or collected and often they were just repeated2. All this w as easier said than done . The public had  for long been used to the RBI articulating inflation concerns in terms of the WPI under a multiple indicator based monetary policy framework . In January 2015 , a new all India consumer price index had been constructed with 2012 as its base. The problem for the RBI was, however, that it had never reacted to CPI inflation before. Consequently, the responsiveness of CPI inflation to policy impulses was unknown. There was no way to calibrate policy actions. The anointment of headline CPI inflation as  the offici al measure of inflation was a brave move in another significant aspect -  almost half of the CPI basket was food! The Indian economy has had a long history of being buffeted  by food shocks which exhibit persistence and spillovers. Supply shocks cannot be wi thin the remit of monetary policy. The RBI took the view that although the first incidence of a food shock is  outside the purview of monetary policy, second round effects such as on inflation expectations and especially, spillovers impacting the rest of in flation  are! It also judged that headline CPI inflation is more easily communicated than an exclusion measure stripped of its most salient components.  The RBI set out a glide path for bringing down inflation from its peak of 11.5 per cent in November 2013  towards more conscionable levels , abjuring a big bang in order to minimise output losses of disinflation. Within this path, it set up self- imposed targets \u2013 8 per cent by the end of 2014; 6 per cent by end -2015 and 5 per cent by end -2016. These targets we re achieved  with a large measure of good luck (the collapse of international commodity price s in 2014; geometric averaging in the new CPI ) but                                                  2 The WPI has a low weight for food items, which i s not in sync with consumption patterns  of households.  It does not includes services.  Price relatives are drawn from a mix of markets, but primarily from bulk sale markets where ordinary consumer do not shop.  8 perhaps fortune  favour s the brave! This was the backdrop against which t he MPC set about its work. It was destined to co nfront a growth -inflation balance on the razor\u2019s edge over the year ahead amid st heightened uncertainty.    IV. The Year Gone By   The first year of the MPC\u2019s functioning would be a tumultuous one in more ways than one. After several false starts, global demand and trade secured a tenuous foothold in the second half of 2016 and gained traction through the first half of 2017. Financial markets were churned by political events , though . In November 2016, the US presidential elections stampeded capital flows out of  EMEs and a surge of the US dollar triggered siz eable depreciations in currencies around the world. Again in January 2017, the \u2018Brexit\u2019 roadmap and expectations of fiscal expansionism by the new US administration propelled the US dollar to a multi -year high. As 2017 progressed, reflation trade lifted equ ity markets, hardened bond yields and returned capital flows to emerging markets. The US dollar\u2019s bull  run lost steam by mid -March ; in fact, it weakened right through early September,  while EME currencies traded with an appreciating bias. By late September, however, there was a complete reversal. The US dollar clawed back lost ground with the announcement of Fed balance sheet normalisation  and tensions around North Korea. Capital outflows from EME equity markets gathered pace. For India, an improvement in e xternal sector viability occurred despite these global developments. Generally buoyant capital inflows buffered up the foreign exchange reserves.   What would challenge the MPC throughout the year was the  domestic dilemma \u2013  the trade -off between inflation and growth was set to become sharp and the tension between the two so acute  that it would eventually impact the voting pattern of the MPC . Shortly, I am going to focus exclusively on the trials and tribulations facing the MPC in this crucial balancing act;  for a moment, however, let me introspect on the RBI.    9 At the time of the MPC\u2019s first meeting a year ago, the RBI itself was caught up in the throes of leadership change \u2013  the twenty -fourth Governor had just assumed office ; the Deputy Governor responsible  for monetary policy had not yet been appointed , and the senior- most Deputy Governor had to step in to complete the six -member MPC. Also, the RBI had been working with the convivial guidance of a technical advisory committee since 2005. The more formal pro cesses associated with an MPC had to be literally tailored from the cross -country experience to adapt to the country -specifics. What emerged was quite a unique sequence of institutional procedures informed heavily by internal management information systems .  As the MPC set about its first meeting, the accommodative cycle of monetary policy in India that commenced in January 2015 was maturing , with the policy rate having been reduced by a cumulative 150 basis points  already . Yet, the ground underneath was moving. Macroeconomic and liquidity conditions were about to undergo tectonic shifts. The combination of a stronger than usual seasonal spike in vegetable prices, highly elevated pulses prices and international crude prices  firming up from a recent trough , veered inflation up from its projected path during April -July 2016, even as growth slowed. In the August CPI reading \u2013 which was the first print that became available to the MPC \u2013  a glimpse of the forming vortex was reveal ed. With a suddenness that overturned the April -July surge, inflation fell off a cliff as the prices of vegetables and pulses sank into deflation!   In these challenging circumstances, the MPC prognosticated inflation developments as \u201c\u2026a downward shift in t he momentum of food inflation \u2013  which holds the key to future inflation outcomes\u2026 .\u201d This assessment would turn out to be prophetic! On the hope that the satisfactory monsoon and cautious business optimism would quicken growth in the window of opportunity t hat the lull in inflation opened up, the MPC voted unanimously for a reduction of 25 basis points in the policy rate . This took the cumulative rate reduction to 175 basis points in this phase of easing . In this meeting, the MPC maintain ed an accommodative policy stance.  10 Just a month later, demonetisation  \u2013 which involved withdrawal of about 87  per cent of the outstanding stock of currency from circulation , setting off a sudden liquidity explosion in the system \u2013  altered monetary conditions drastically. Ove r the next few months, the pangs of currency exchange preoccupied the nation, but when the definitive history of that time is documented, the RBI\u2019s valiant defence of financial stability , right  from the morning after,  will hopefully receive its due. As the  withdrawn currency notes were returned by the public, deposits flooded into banks and swamped them with idle reserves. A wall of liquidity started moving through financial markets, threatening to take down everything in its path \u2013  interest rates; yields; exchange rates; asset prices. Standing alone between the ocean of liquidity and financial chaos, the RBI mounted an extraordinary liquidity absorption strategy. It combined unconventional instruments with regular operations when the liquidity tsunami was s o overwhelming that it could have completely depleted the RBI\u2019s stock of government securities that are used as collateral in reverse repo auctions. In order to tide over the delay in obtaining market stabilisation scheme securities from the government, th e incremental cash reserve ratio (ICRR) was deployed and for the first time in the RBI\u2019s history, an ICRR of the size of 100 per cent of the relevant demand and time liabilities of banks was applied.   These austere conditions weighed ponderously upon the MPC's meetings in December 2016, February  and April 2017. Ab initio , the MPC recognised that its assessment of underlying conditions will likely be clouded by demonetisation effects that were unfolding in the form of transient disruption of cash -intensive segments of the economy, an abrupt compression of demand, restrained discretionary spending and fire sales of perishables that would reduce inflation temporarily. Accordingly, it decided \u2013 unanimously again \u2013  to look through these 'transitory but unclear e ffects' that were influencing the outlook disproportionately. It kept the policy rate unchanged  through these meetings , but noting that inflation excluding food and fuel was  setting a floor to headline inflation by exhibiting downward  inflexibility . The MP C also worried that global financial market spillovers could impact macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets . Accordingly , it changed the policy stance from 11 accommodative to neutral in its February meeting. Importantly, the MPC renewed its commitment t o the inflation target of 4 per cent. In keeping with this stance, the RBI refined its liquidity management framework in its April meeting, inter alia  narrowing the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) corridor to +/ -25 basis points (from +/ -50 basis points  earlier)  to ensure a finer alignment of the weighted average call money rate, the operating target of monetary policy, with the policy rate.   Three features distinguish these meetings of the MPC. First, it was assailed by the criticism of large one -sided inflation forecast errors right up to the June inflation print, which turned out to be a historic low. Demonetisation was readily available to denou nce. Yet, the collapse in inflation occurred from August  2016 , well before demonetisation , which  could have accentuated it transitorily  during November 2016-January 2017. The cumulative deviation of 80 basis points between actual inflation and forecasts be tween August 2016 and June 2017 was entirely due to th e twin deflation  of vegetable and pulses prices that produced a trend shift, holding a mirror to serious errors in food management which would later ignite wide -spread farmers\u2019 unrest. In this context, the MPR of October 2017 stated:  \u201cThese developments may warrant a reappraisal of the scope and quality of food management strategies that seem prone to failure in the face of shocks in either direction. In the past too, supply shocks, of which large one -sided deviations of inflation from projections are merely a symptom, drove disinflation episodes.\u201d In the rush to pillory the scapegoat, attention was diverted from the real issues and consequently, from the right fixes.  Second, there was an overwhelming p reference to wait out the transitory effects of demonetisation. Although today , it appears the logical decision to take, markets were taken by surprise  by the neutral stance and sentiment turned bearish. At the cost of a hawkish tone, the MPC was striving to anchor expectations in a situation when even the near- term was a step in the dark. Third, the decisions of the MPC in these meetings were taken by unanimity, although driven by individualistic approaches. The MPR of April 2017 surveyed the recent countr y experience and found many decisions  taken by unanimity. Where differences were revealed, they were typically confined to 12 the size of the change in the policy rate rather than contesting the overarching policy stance.  The June and August meetings of the MPC were different from the three that preceded them, being literally on the horns of the growth -inflation dilemma. Although inflation had firmed up a bit in February and March, its abrupt and significant retreat in April caused the MPC to lower the forecast path of inflation for 2017 -18 from 4.5 per cent in H1 and 5 per cent in H2 to 2 -3.5 per cent in H1 and 3.5 -4.5 pe r cent in H2 in its June meeting. It unambiguously pointed out that \u201cprices of pulses are clearly reeling under the impact of a supply glut caused by record output and imports. Policy interventions, including access to open trade, may be envisaged to arres t the slump in prices.\u201d Abundant supply, coupled with the renege on procurement by designated agencies, resulted in the market price of pulses falling sharply below minimum support prices fixed by the government. Nonetheless, the MPC did express misgivings  about the durability of the unusually low momentum of inflation, the likelihood of petrol and diesel prices rising , and the possibility that the stickiness of inflation excluding food and fuel would re -assert itself soon. It also indicated that the transi tory effects of demonetisation have \u2018lingered on in price formations\u2019 and warned that \u2018premature action at this stage risks disruptive policy reversals later and the loss of credibility.\u2019 Importantly, the MPC prognosis of economic activity also reflected i ts concern about a deeper than initially anticipated loss of momentum . It underscored the urgency around reviving private investment, restoring banking sector health and removing infrastructural bottlenecks all of which were outside the purview of monetary  policy but would greatly enhance its effectiveness. For the first time, the MPC voted to keep the policy rate unchanged not by unanimity but by a five -member majority, as the scars left by falling growth and inflation set up conflicting pulls.  In the August meeting, the MPC saw for the first time the impact of the implementation of the house rent allowance (HRA) for central government employees for which it had been preparing the public for some time, especially the need to distinguish between \u2018statistical\u2019 and second round effects. The former would merely 13 push up the index without actual inflation, while the latter would warrant careful monitoring for evidence of generali sation. The MPC observed that some upside risks to inflation had reduced \u2013  inflation excluding the HRA impact would likely be only a little above 4 per cent by Q4; inflation excluding food and fuel ha d fallen significantly over the past three months \u2013  but underlying growth imp ulses in industry and services were weakening, given c orporate deleveraging and the retrenchment of investment demand. In fact, growth projections for 2016 -17 and 2017- 18 had been revised down by a cumulative 70 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively (in its October 2017 meeting, the MPC would revise it down even further, as I will shortly bring out , and the cumulative downward adjustment would be 70 basis points for each year).  Seizing the space that had opened up for some accommodation, the MPC decided to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis poin ts but with a neutral stance . In order to derive the maximum effects of the rate cut, it reiterated the  urgent need to revive private investment, remove infrastructure bottlenecks, resolve stress in corporate balance sheets and recapitalise public sector b anks to help restart credit flows. This time around, the vote was carried by a four- member majority , and the divergence in voting preference was two -sided \u2013 one member voted  for status quo while another voted for a rate cut by 50 bps.    V. The Fourth Bi -Monthly Monetary Policy, 2017 -18 The monetary policy statement o f October 2017  was framed in quite a dramatic setting. Even as growth broadened globally, it slowed below 6 per cent for the second quarter in a row in India in April -June. At this rate, India was  still among the fastest growing large economies of the world, but the blow from the growth print  was significant enough to set off a chorus of alarm.   The slowdown was essentially located in manufacturing activity which slumped to a 20-quarter low. Over the recent few years, industrial output  has shown synchronicity across geographies, with trade being identified as the channel of co -movement. In th e early part of 2017 -18, however, Indian industry has been an outlier, decelerating just when industrial production the world over is on the mend. Transient disruptions 14 associated with the GST rollout are likely operating as a drag. Nonetheless, it is fair to say that the nation is impatient to see a revival in industry, especially as capital formation stag ed a modest recovery.   Sharpening the dilemma for the MPC, retail inflation rose nearly  200 basis points since its last meeting. The upturn was broad -based, provoking households to expect that the general level of prices would increase by more than the current rate in the months ahead. Input costs facing both farms and firms rose, but weak pricing power in conditions of subdued demand prevented a fuller- blown pass -through into retail inflation.   In the MPC\u2019s assessment, inflation will likely rise from current levels in the rest of the year, with farm loan waivers and the implementations of pay and allowance revisions by states a la  the centre  posing upside risks. The MPC also pensively expressed concern about the spectres of geopolitical tensions and imminent normalisation of systemic central bank balance sheets that loomed over the outlook. On food inflation, the MPC\u2019s prognosis was more sang uine though, with adequate foodstocks and supply management efforts seen as mitigating factors.   On growth, the MPC regarded  the first estimates of kharif  production \u2013 which were lower than last year\u2019s level and the target for this year \u2013  and the GST roll out as early but transitory setbacks. It believe d that agricultural activity will improve from here on. Furthermore, it found b usiness optimism expressed by firms about prospects for the October -December quarter reassuring. Relative to its August assessmen t, the MPC lowered its growth forecast by 60 basis points which, in a rough and ready sense, measures the net lagged impact of shocks such as demoneti sation and the GST.    The MPC expressed the view that recent structural reforms would support growth over the medium -term. Accordingly, it expected upsides to the growth forecast from the resolution of GST -related impediments and from the pay and allowance revision 15 for state government employees, while the hardening of input costs and the loss of consumer confidence would balance the risks.   The MPC was particularly candid in drawing out the bottom line: \u201c\u2026it is imperative to reinvigorate investment activity.\u201d For this, creation of a conducive environment for investment is critical, involving adequate recapitali sation of stressed banks, closing the infrastructure gap, simplifying the GST, hastening clearances and rationalis ing procedures  by states relating to investment proposals.  Against this backdrop of its appraisal of the evolution of macroeconomic  and financial conditions, the MPC decided to hold the policy rate unchanged and to maintain a neutral policy stance. In the reactions that followed, there seemed a central tendency that the MPC may have called right.   V. Concluding Remarks    I hope my thoughts on the recent monetary policy engagement have provided some clarity on the challenges confronting the MPC and the rationale underlying its decision s. Monetary policy is ultimately the art or science of the feasible. Ben Bernanke, when he was chairma n of the Federal Reserve Board, was once asked by Liaquat Ahmed , the author of the celebrated book Lords of Finance , as to how confident he was that the theory of quantitative easing or QE would work. His reply \u2013  \u201cThe problem with QE is it works in practic e but it doesn't work in theory\" \u2013 provoked laughter, but it  is so true of monetary policy more generally. Monetary policy decision making is always complex and severely testing. It is typically undertaken in an explosion of diverse views, each differing from the other in expressing intensity and fervour. The endeavour of  our MPC has been to try to share with the public through its r esolution s and through individual minutes a set of balanced assessments so  that monetary policy in India becomes transparent and predictable. Looking ahead, the task of the MPC is cut out and I can do no better than quote Governor Dr. Patel from his recent interview: \u201cwe should aim at achieving the inflation target without losing sight of supporting economic growth.\u201d  ", "06 Mar 07 FM.pdf": "1Development of Local Currency Bond Markets:The Indian ExperienceShyamala Gopinath1It gives me great pleasure to participate in the Workshop on \"Debt, Finance and EmergingIssues in Financial Integration\", being organized by the Financing for Development Office,United Nations in collaboration with the Commonwealth Business Council andCommonwealth Secretariat. In my presentation, I would like to highlight the Indianexperience with regard to the development of debt markets.As you are all aware, the imperative of developing domestic debt markets has beenreinforced by the lessons of the financial crises that affected a large number of countries inEast Asia and elsewhere in the late 1990s. Indeed, the significance of a well-diversifiedfinancial system, including a deep and liquid bond market, that obviates excessivedependence on the banking system, and helps avoiding the double mismatches of currencyand maturity, was quite tellingly felt in the context of the crisis.In India, the development of government bond market has been taken up as part of thestructural reforms process initiated in 1991-92 in the aftermath of the external paymentscrisis in the previous year. The external payments crisis was largely engendered by thedeteriorating fiscal situation during the previous decade which was marked by high andpersistent fiscal and revenue deficits, substantial debt-servicing burden, captive use of bankresources at sub-market clearing rates and increasing recourse to monetary financing of thebudget deficit with its attendant inflationary consequences. The structural reform processthat was initiated as a response to the crisis included apart from fiscal reforms, industrialderegulation, liberalization of foreign direct investment, trade liberalization and financialsector reforms. The objective of these wide-ranging reforms was to place the economy on ahigher growth trajectory by inducing greater efficiency and competitiveness in all spheres ofactivity. Within this overall context, reforms in the Government securities market wereundertaken essentially to finance the budgetary requirements of the government in a non-inflationary and more \u2018efficient\u2019 manner; develop a benchmark for the pricing and valuationof other securities; and facilitate monetary policy operations through indirect instruments inthe context of a liberalised financial environment.                                               1 Paper presented by Smt. Shyamala Gopinath, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at theWorkshop on 'Debt, Finance and Emerging Issues in Financial Integration\u2019, organized byCommonwealth Secretariat London, March 6-7, 2007. Assistance provided by Mr. Somnath Chatterjiin preparation of the paper is gratefully acknowledged.2Under India\u2019s federal system of government, the Constitution allocates the revenue powersand expenditure functions between the Central and State Governments. The CentralGovernment can borrow both within and outside the country. It is worth noting in thiscontext, that even though combined fiscal deficit of the Central and State Governments inIndia has been among the highest in the world, the Government did not have to resort toexternal borrowing, except from bilateral and multilateral sources. This has rendered greaterstability to the system.Borrowing by the State Governments is subordinated to prior approval by the CentralGovernment. This is embodied in Article 293 of the Indian Constitution, under which, anyState Government that is indebted to the Central Government, requires prior approvalbefore borrowing from financial markets. Furthermore, State Governments are not permittedto borrow externally, unlike the Centre.The local debt market comprises the Government securities market (of both the CentralGovernment and the 28 State Governments) and the corporate bond market. The ReserveBank of India (RBI) is the banker to and manager of marketable internal debt of the CentralGovernment by statute. Internal marketable debt, at present, accounts for around 40 percent of the total outstanding debt of the Central Government, whereas net marketborrowings account for around 77 per cent of the Gross Fiscal Deficit (GFD). The RBI is abanker to and manager of the marketable debt of the State Governments under voluntaryagreements. Internal marketable debt, at present, accounts for around 20 per cent of thetotal outstanding liabilities of the State Governments whereas net market borrowingsaccount for around 20 per cent of their GFD.Against this backdrop, the structure of my presentation is as follows. In Section, I shallbriefly trace the evolution of deficits and debt of the Central Government over the period ofreforms. In Section II, I shall discuss the various initiatives for the development of theCentral Government debt market. Section III would highlight the impact of the reforms onvarious parameters of the Central Government debt market. The next two Sections would bedevoted to the trends in the deficits and debt of the State Governments and issues relatingto their market borrowings, respectively. Issues relating to the development of the corporatebond market would be covered in Section VI. The Concluding Section would highlight a fewissues in the way ahead.3I. Trends in Budget Deficits and Debt of the Central GovernmentThree distinct phases in fiscal performance of the Central Government are evident since theinitiation of reforms in 1991-92. In the first phase , which lasted upto the mid-1990s, therewas a significant reduction in fiscal deficit from around 8 per cent to 5 per cent of GDP andin the public debt from 55 per cent to 51 per cent of GDP. During this period, fiscalcorrection primarily reflected curtailment of investment expenditure, even while major taxreforms were initiated via reduction/rationalization of rates and widening of the tax base.Table 1: Trends in Centre\u2019s Budget Deficits  (as per cent of GDP)1990-911991-921995-962000-012001-022002-032003-042004-052005-062006-07(RE) (BE)Gross FiscalDeficit7.85 5.56 5.07 5.64 6.18 5.92 4.47 4.01 4.14 3.76RevenueDeficit3.26 2.49 2.50 4.01 4.39 4.40 3.56 2.51 2.60 2.14Gross PrimaryDeficit4.07 1.49 0.86 0.93 1.47 1.11 -0.03 -0.06 0.46 0.22Table 2: Financing Pattern of the Centre\u2019s Gross Fiscal Deficit (in per cent)1990-911991-921995-962000-012001-022002-032003-042004-052005-062006-07(RE) (BE)ExternalFinance7.1 14.9 0.5 6.3 4.0 -8.2 -10.9 11.8 5.1 5.6MarketBorrowing17.9 20.7 56.4 61.8 64.4 71.8 72.1 40.7 69.2 76.5OthersBorrowing49.5 45.5 26.8 32.9 32.7 35.2 42.0 54.0 15.4 17.9Note: The balance amount represents draw down of cash balances4Chart 1: Trends in the Debt of the Central and State Governments (as a ratio to GDP)01020304050607080901980-81 1990-91 1996-97 2000-01 2004.05 2006-07(BE)Per centCentre States TotalIn the second phase , which covered the next five to six years, there was, however, asignificant reversal of trend with the fiscal deficit and public debt increasing, as a ratio toGDP, to around 6 per cent and 64 per cent, respectively. The revenue deficit increased toover 4 per cent of GDP during this period, which was even higher than the level prevailingon the eve of the crisis. Deterioration in the fiscal situation during the second phase evenwhile reform efforts continued, was related, inter-alia , to (a) the slowdown in the growth rateof the economy which adversely impacted on tax revenues; (b) upsurge in expenditures onwages and salaries of the government sector consequent to the Fifth Pay Commissionaward; and (c) the increase in interest payments following the sharp rise in yields onGovernment securities in the first phase following the introduction of auctions.In the third phase , which began in 2002-03, signs of improvement in the fiscal situation areagain evident, with the fiscal deficit and revenue deficit progressively reduced to around 4per cent and 2 per cent of GDP, respectively. (In fact, as per the recently released UnionBudget for 2007-08, the fiscal deficit and the revenue deficit have been placed at 3.3 percent and 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2007-08). The debt-GDP ratio has begun inchingdownwards, even though its level remains on the higher side at around 62 per cent. The on-going improvement in the fiscal situation in the third phase can be attributed to a rebound ineconomic growth to a higher trajectory which, in turn, has positively impacted on taxbuoyancy as well as enhanced fiscal discipline following the enactment of fiscalresponsibility legislation, to which we now turn.5The Central Government's Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003(FRBMA)  came into force in August 2003 and associated Fiscal Rules were notified in July2004. In terms of the Act, the Centre was required to eliminate its revenue deficit by end-March 2008, and thereafter build up adequate revenue surplus. The rules under the Actfurther require the Centre to reduce the revenue deficit by an equivalent of at least 0.5 percent of GDP at the end of each fiscal year beginning 2004-05. The Gross Fiscal Deficit(GFD) is to be reduced by at least 0.3 per cent of GDP at the   end of each fiscal yearbeginning 2004-05, so that it is brought down to 3 per cent of GDP in 2008. The FinanceAct, 2004 shifted the targets fixed for end-March 2008 in respect of the revenue deficit andGFD to end-March 2009 (consistent with the fiscal restructuring plan envisaged by theTwelfth Finance Commission). The enactment of FRBMA provides a clear direction to thefiscal consolidation process and enhances the credibility of fiscal policies. Furthermore, interms of the provisions of the FRBMA, the RBI is prohibited from subscribing to the primaryissuances of Central Government securities with effect from April 2006. This will completethe transition to a fully market-based issuance of Central Government securities.I would like to conclude this Section by highlighting that the share of external debt in thetotal debt of the Central Government has been low even before the initiation of the reforms.All the external loans were obtained from multilateral/bilateral sources. Subsequent to thereforms, the share of external loans declined substantially. The Government of India has notborrowed on \u2018commercial\u2019 basis externally.Chart 2: Composition of Centre\u2019s Debt0.020.040.060.080.0100.0Per cent1950-51 1980-81 1990-91 2000-01 2006-07(BE) Domestic Liabilities External Liabilities6II. Initiatives for the Development of the Central Government Securities MarketAs indicated earlier, the pre-reform period was characterized by a substantial and sustainedincrease in the fiscal deficit of the Government. While such budgetary imbalances hadadverse macroeconomic consequences, these also necessitated large issuance ofgovernment securities in India, which formed the basis for the development of a governmentsecurities market.The Government securities market before the 1990s was characterised by administeredinterest rates, high Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) requirements that led to the existence ofcaptive investors, and the absence of a liquid and transparent secondary market for G-Secs.Low coupon rates were offered on Government securities to keep Government borrowingcosts down, which made real rates of return negative for several years till the mid-1980s.During the 1980s, the volume of Government debt expanded considerably, particularlyshort-term debt, due to automatic accommodation to Central Government by the ReserveBank, through the mechanism of ad hoc Treasury Bills. However, with a captive investorbase and low interest rates, the secondary market for Government bonds remaineddormant. Artificial yields on Government securities affected the yield structure of financialassets in the system, and led to an overall high interest rate environment in the rest of themarket. Driven by these compulsions, the Reserve Bank\u2019s monetary management wascharacterised by a regime of administered interest rates, and rising Cash Reserve Ratio(CRR) and SLR prescriptions. High CRR and SLR left little room for monetarymanoeuvering. Furthermore, the period was marked by greater pre-emption of financialsavings. Given such high pre-emptions and administered interest rates which were artificiallykept lower than the market rates, there was no possibility of price discovery. Reforms in theGovernment securities market undertaken as part of the overall structural reforms processinitiated in 1991-92, aimed to redress these infirmities.The early initiatives  (1992-95) in the reform of the G-sec market which aimed at creatingan enabling environment included (i) the elimination of the automatic monetization of thebudget deficit of the Central Government, and in its place putting in a system of Ways andMeans Advances, to facilitate further reforms in the market and facilitate monetary policyformulation; (ii) switch to market-related interest rates on Government securities to facilitateprice discovery and (iii) bringing down SLR to its statutory minimum level of 25 per cent;The second phase  (1995-2000) of reforms was directed towards institutional developmentto enhance market activity, settlement and safety. These reforms included (i) establishment7of a Delivery versus Payment system, to reduce settlement risk; (ii) Institution of the systemof Primary Dealers, to strengthen market intermediation; (iii) formation of market bodiessuch as Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA) andPrimary Dealers Association of India (PDAI) to improve practices; and (iv) permission toForeign Institutional Investors to invest in Government securities in both the primary andsecondary markets, with a view to broaden the markets;Instrument diversification  was also undertaken during this phase of reforms. Prior to the1990s, most of the government bond issuances were in the form of plain vanilla, fixedcoupon securities. In order to meet the diverse funding and hedging needs of participants,various types of instruments such as zero coupon bonds, capital indexed bonds, floatingrate bonds and bonds with call and put options, were introduced.Floating Rate Bonds (FRBs)  were introduced in September 1995, but did not evoke muchresponse. These were again issued in November 2001 with some modification in theirstructure. Overwhelming market response paved the way for subsequent issuances tillOctober 2004. The latter issuances of FRBs, however, again failed to evoke adequatemarket response. This was attributed, inter-alia, to low secondary market liquidity (sincethese are essentially hedging instruments and offer limited scope for trading gains) andcomplex pricing methodology in the secondary market.Capital Indexed bonds (CIB)  were issued in December 1997. Subsequent to that issuance,there was no further issuance of CIB mainly due to lack of an enthusiastic response ofmarket participants for the instrument, both in primary and secondary markets. Some of thereasons cited for the lackluster response were: (a) it only offered inflation hedging for theprincipal, while the coupons of the bond were left unprotected against inflation and (b)complexities involved in pricing of the instrument.Hence, plain vanilla bonds continue to be predominant in the issuances of Governmentsecurities.The (on-going) third phase  (2000 onwards) of reforms is aimed at enhancing liquidity andefficiency of the G-Sec market. Some of the important initiatives in this phase are: (i)introduction of a Liquidity Adjustment Facility by the Reserve Bank to manage short-termliquidity mismatches; (ii) operationalisation of the Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) --- anautomated electronic trading platform --- and the Clearing Corporation of India Limited(CCIL) for trading and settlement/guaranteed settlement by a central counterparty and bring8in straight through processing; (iii) introduction of trading of G-secs in stock exchanges; (iv)introduction of exchange-traded Interest Rate Futures to facilitate hedging of market risk; (v)introduction of Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) which would facilitate liquiditymanagement; (vi) DvP III mode of settlement has been enabled which permits netsettlement of both funds and securities legs; (vii) announcement of an indicative auctioncalendar for Treasury Bills and dated securities, to help investors plan their investmentbetter and to enhance transparency and stability in the Government securities market; and(viii) introduction of the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) which has expanded theinstruments available to the Reserve Bank for managing the surplus liquidity in the system.Proceeds of Government paper issued via auctions under the MSS to mop up liquiditygenerated on account of the accretion to the Reserve Bank\u2019s foreign assets are parked withthe Reserve Bank to neutralise the monetary impact of capital flows.  The objective of MSSis essentially to differentiate the liquidity absorption of a more enduring nature by way ofsterilisation from the day-to-day normal liquidity management operations (under LAF).Government paper issued under MSS is no different from other Government securitiesissued under the borrowing program. These securities also trade in the secondary market aspart of other stock.Initiatives were also taken to widen the investor base for G-secs. Traditionally, the investorbase for government securities in India has been banks, financial institutions, ProvidentFunds (PFs), insurance and pension funds but commercial banks and Life InsuranceCorporation of India (LIC) are the largest holders. Most of the holdings of these investors arein the nature of statutorily mandated investments. This category has been further diversifiedby the entry of cooperative banks, regional rural banks, mutual funds and non-bankingfinance companies in the recent period. In addition, the entry of 100 per cent Gilt MutualFunds has broadened the retail investor base. To enable small and medium sized investorsto participate in the primary auction of government securities, a \u201cScheme of Non CompetitiveBidding\u201d was introduced in January 2002, which is open to any person including firms,companies, corporate bodies, institutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entityprescribed by RBI. The scheme provides for allocation of up to 5 per cent of the notifiedamount at the weighted average rate of accepted bids. Investors can bid through banks orPDs a minimum amount of Rs.10,000 to a maximum amount of Rs. 20 million. A few PDshave already introduced schemes for retail marketing of Government securities using thenetwork of bank branches and post offices.9Foreign portfolio investors [called Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs)] are also permitted toinvest in G-Secs subject to a limit that is currently placed at US$2.6 billion, to increase toUS$3.2 billion by the end of the year.With effect from the fiscal year 2006-07, as per the provisions under the FiscalResponsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act 2003 , the Reserve Bank'sparticipation in the primary market for Central Government securities stands withdrawn. Thishas necessitated significant changes in the setting and operating framework of monetary,debt management and regulatory policies of the Reserve Bank.In order to address these emerging needs and equip RBI as well as the market participantsappropriately, a Technical Group on Central Government Securities Market was constitutedwhich proposed a medium-term framework for the evolution of the Central Governmentsecurities market.On the basis of the recommendations of the above Group, the Reserve Bank's AnnualPolicy Statement of April 2005 indicated that in the post-FRBM period, the Reserve Bankwould reorient government debt management operations while simultaneouslystrengthening monetary operations. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank constituted a newdepartment named as Financial Markets Department (FMD) in July 2005 with a view tomoving towards functional separation between debt management and monetary operations.Second, it was proposed that the number of actively traded securities would be enlarged toenhance liquidity and improve pricing in the market through active consolidation inconsultation with the Government while continuing the programme of reissuances. In thisregard, the Annual Policy Statement of April 2006 had proposed that identified illiquidsecurities will be bought from the secondary market by the Reserve Bank and once a criticalamount of securities is acquired, they would be bought back by the Government toextinguish the stock. The modalities of consolidation are being worked out in consultationwith the Government.Third, the settlement system for transactions in government securities was standardised toT+1 cycle effective May 11, 2005 with a view to provide the participants with moreprocessing time at their disposal and therefore, to enable better management of both fundsas well as risk.Fourth, in order to provide banks and other institutions with a more advanced and moreefficient trading platform, an anonymous order matching trading platform (NDS-OM) was10introduced with effect from August 01, 2005. The participation in the NDS-OM platform hasbeen extended (beyond banks, PDs and financial institutions) to insurance companies, allqualified mutual funds, provident funds and pension funds. The NDS-OM is an additionalfacility available to the participants and the participants continue to have the option of usingthe current telephone trading platform. The settlements of both types of transactions are,however, integrated.Fifth, intra-day short sale was permitted in dated Government securities subject to certainstipulations with effect from February 28, 2006.  This was done because it was observedthat in the absence of instruments that allow players to take a view on the interest rates, themarkets were active and liquid when the rates were falling but turned lackluster and illiquidwhen the rates increased. Short sales would enable market participants to express theirviews on interest rate expectations, manage their interest rate risk more efficiently and alsoimpart liquidity to the markets, even in a rising interest rate scenario. The period of shortsale has recently been extended to five days.Sixth, guidelines for introduction of 'when issued' market in Central government securitiesmarket were issued on May 3, 2006. This would facilitate an efficient distribution process forGovernment securities by stretching the actual distribution period for each issue andallowing the market more time to absorb large issues without disruption, in addition toproviding better price discovery.Seventh, PDs have been permitted to diversify their activities, as considered appropriate, inaddition to their core business of Government securities, subject to limits. This would enablebetter risk management through generation of alternative sources of income.Eighth, guidelines on the extension of PD business to banks which fulfil certain minimumeligibility criteria were issued on February 27, 2006.Ninth, a revised scheme for underwriting commitment and liquidity support to PDs has beenintroduced with effect from April 1, 2006 whereby PDs are required to meet 100 per centunderwriting commitment in each auction, replacing the earlier requirement of biddingcommitment and voluntary underwriting (which did not guarantee that the notified amountwill be sold in each auction).11III. Impact of Reforms on the Central Government Securities MarketAs a result of gradual reform measures taken over the years, the Indian G-Sec market hasbecome increasingly broad-based, characterised by an efficient auction process, an activesecondary market and a liquid yield curve up to 30 years. The market is now supported byan active Primary Dealer (PD) system and electronic trading and settlement technology thatensure safe settlement with Straight Through Processing (STP) and central counterpartyguarantee.The outstanding stock of G-secs as on end-March 2006 is nearly thirteen times the level in1992. Outstanding stock of G-secs as a ratio to GDP has nearly doubled to around 28 percent over this period. Turnover of G-secs has been placed at well over 200 per cent inrecent years as against 34 per cent in 1996.Table 3 It is pertinent to add here that recently the Government of India converted (non-tradable)special securities amounting to nearly Rs.900 billion issued to banks towards capitalinfusion, into tradable, SLR Government of India dated securities. The substitution of non-tradable securities to tradable securities is expected to facilitate increased access of thebanking sector to additional resources for lending to productive sectors, in the light of theincreasing credit needs of the economy.It may be also important to note that the Reserve Bank has been encouraging the growth ofthe collateralized money market with the objective minimizing default risk in the moneymarket. As a consequence, there has been a major shift in transactions from theuncollateralized to the collateralized segment, underscoring the development of the G-secmarket.1992 1996 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006O utstanding stock (R s. in billion) 769 1375 5363 6739 8,243 8,953 9,767O utstanding stock as ratio of G D P  (per cent)14.68 14.2 27.89 27.2929.87 28.69 27.67Turnover / G D P  (per cent) -- 34.21 157.68 202.88 217.3 239.9 212.9Average m aturity of the securities issued during the year (in Y ears) -- 5.7 14.3 13.8 14.94 14.13 16.9W eighted average cost of the securities issued during the year (P er cent)11.78 13.77 9.44 7.34 5.71 6.11 7.34M inim um  and m axim um  m aturities of stock issued during the year (in Y ears) N .A. 2-10 5-25 7-30 4-30 5-30 5-30S n ap sh ot o f the In d ian G -S ec M arket12During the greater part of the 1990s, the maturity of Central Government securities rangedupto 10 years. This resulted in potential redemption pressure and rollover risk. With a viewto address these concerns as also to develop the yield curve for longer tenors, the ReserveBank progressively increased the tenors upto 30 years by early 2000. As a consequence,the weighted average maturity of securities increased from 5.5 years in 1995-96 to 16.9years in 2005-06; the weighted average maturity during 2006-07 so far works out to 14.6years. The weighted average yield of securities also declined from 13.8 per cent in 1995-96to 5.7 per cent in 2003-04. Since then, it has increased to 7.3 per cent in 2005-06 andfurther to 7.9 per cent in 2006-07 so far.Chart 3: Weighted Average Yield and Weighted Average MaturityThe Reserve Bank's efforts to elongate the maturity profile resulted in a smooth and reliableyield curve to act as a benchmark for the other markets for pricing and valuation purposes.The Indian yield curve today compares with not only emerging market economies but alsothe developed world.0246810121416181995-961996-971997-981998-991999-002000-012001-022002-032003-042004-052005-06Per cent / YearsWeighted Average Yield (per cent) Weighted Average Maturity (years)13Chart 4: Central G-secs Yield Curves02468101214161 3 5 7 911 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29Maturity (Years)Per centMar-97 Mar-04 Jan-07The process of passive consolidation (through reopening of existing stock instead of issuingnew securities every time) has helped in containing the number of bonds around the levelthat was prevailing at the end of 1998-99. This was a significant factor that promotedsecondary market liquidity for Government Securities.Market liquidity today compares well not only with the emerging economies, but also withthe developed world, with bid-offer spreads in benchmark securities at 1-2 bps. Theilliquidity premium levels are also in line with those in the international markets.The holding of G-secs among financial institutions has been more diversified, particularly,with the emergence of insurance and pension funds as a 'durable' investor class for thelong-term securities. This became possible due to the sustained efforts devoted toelongating the maturity profile of Government securities by developing a smooth and robustyield curve.14 Chart 5: Ownership Pattern of Central G-Secs: 199125%56%13%0%0%1%0%0%5%Reserve Bank of India (own account)Commercial BanksLife Insurance Corporation of India #Unit Trust of IndiaNABARDEmployees Provident Fund SchemeCoal Mines Provident Fund SchemePrimary dealersOthersChart 6: Ownership Pattern of Central G-Secs: 20057%53%20%0%0%2%0%0%16%Reserve Bank of India(own account)Commercial BanksLife InsuranceCorporation of India #Unit Trust of IndiaNABARDEmployees ProvidentFund SchemeCoal Mines ProvidentFund SchemePrimary dealersOthersIt may be observed from the above charts that over the period 1991 to 2005, the share ofthe Reserve Bank in the holdings of Government securities has declined significantly, whilethat of Life Insurance Corporation has increased. The share of commercial banks has alsodeclined, albeit  slightly, but they continue to account for the predominant share of holdings.Currently a large portion of G-secs is held in the investment portfolio of banks. As and whenit becomes possible to lower the SLR (via the recent Ordinance), it will become even moreimportant to widen the investor base. The market making role of PDs will also become moreimportant and they will have to make extra efforts to widen the investor base to add playerssuch as provident funds, pension funds, cooperative banks, trusts, NGOs and otherinstitutions.15It is significant to note that the debt management operations of the Reserve Bank arecomparable to best global practices as these substantially adhere to the public debtmanagement guidelines of the IMF/World Bank (Annex) .IV. Evolution of State Government FinancesThe story at the State Government level is somewhat similar to that of the Centre. Thedeterioration in the fiscal situation which began in the late 1980s, accelerated in thefollowing decade consequent to the Fifth Pay Commission award as also the slackening ofCentral devolution and transfer of resources to the States in the face of a slowdown in thegrowth rate. At the same time, State finances have been long afflicted with stagnant non-taxrevenues as a consequence of inappropriate user charges on various services. Indeed, theGFD and the revenue deficit had increased to over 4  per cent and over 2.5 per cent ofGDP, in the early years of the present decade, while the debt was placed at over 33 percent of GDP.Table 4: Trends in the Budget Deficits of the State Governments (as a per cent ofGDP)1990-911991-921995-962000-012001-022002-032003-042004-052005-062006-07(RE) (BE)GFD 3.3 2.89 2.65 4.25 4.21 4.17 4.46 3.5 3.23 2.68RevenueDeficit0.93 0.87 0.69 2.54 2.59 2.25 2.22 1.17 0.49 0.05Gross PrimaryDeficit1.78 1.22 0.8 0.09 -0.15 -0.61 -0.75 -1.65 -2.03 -2.47Table 5: Financing Pattern of the Gross Fiscal Deficit of the State Governments  (inper cent)1990-911991-921995-962000-012001-022002-032003-042004-052005-062006-07(RE) (BE)Loan FromCentralGov.53.1 49.6 47.1 9.4 11.4 -0.9 11.5 -15.1 2.3 4.8MarketBorrowing12.0 17.5 18.7 14.0 18.0 27.9 38.4 30.1 15.7 21.0NSSF - - - 36.4 37.1 51.2 16.9 66.5 65.0 53.516Others 33.3 32.9 34.2 40.2 33.5 21.9 33.2 18.5 17.0 20.7The recommendations of the Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC) are an important milestonein the fiscal path of the States (and Central) Governments over the five-year periodbeginning 2005-06. The TFC recommended for the elimination of Central loans to States fortheir Plan schemes beginning 2005-06, although there will be some transitionalarrangements. Thus, the borrowing of the State Governments will be increasing marketdetermined, paving the way for the emergence of a vibrant sub-national debt market. TheTFC also recommended a fiscal restructuring plan under which revenue deficit would beeliminated and the fiscal deficit would be reduced to 3 per cent of GDP, separately for theCentre and the States. In order to incentivise adherence to the fiscal restructuring plan, theTFC recommended a debt relief scheme linked to the enactment of fiscal responsibilitylegislation by the States with provisions consistent with the restructuring plan.The TFC recommendation accelerated the enactment of fiscal responsibility legislation atthe State level. As many as 24 States have enacted Fiscal Responsibility Legislation (FRL)as compared with only 5 States in 2003-04. As in the case of the Centre, the State FRLsprovide for the elimination of the revenue deficit as well as the reduction of the GFD-GSDP(Gross State Domestic Product) ratio to 3 per cent by 2008-09. The enactment of FRLenhances the credibility of the fiscal consolidation process at the State level. The revenuedeficit has been reduced to 0.5 per cent of GDP in 2005-06, whereas the GFD has declinedto 3.2 per cent of GDP. Most of the States now have sizable cash surpluses in sharpcontrast to the liquidity pressures witnessed less than four years ago. Some of the Stateshave, in this context, proposed to buy-back some of their high-cost securities issued in thepast, so as to reduce the 'carrying cost' on their balances. Such a buy-back auction wasrecently conducted by the Reserve Bank.V. Issues in the Development of the State Government Securities MarketTill 1998-99, open market borrowings of State Governments were conducted entirelythrough tap issuances wherein the coupon rate was fixed as a mark up over the yield of aCentral Government security of corresponding maturity. With the objective of providing ascope for better-managed State Governments to access funds at market rates, the auctionroute was provided to them as an option. During 2006-07 so far, the auction routeaccounted for 100 per cent of the market borrowings of the State Governments, ascompared with 48.5 per cent in the previous year and 2.3 per cent in 2004-05. Moreover, in17all but one auction of State Government securities during 2006-07 so far, the spreads of thecut-off yields over the secondary market yields of a Central Government security ofcorresponding maturity have remained lower than that of 50 basis points (which is thespread fixed in the case of tap issuances). This is indicative of a number of factors includingimproved market perception of the State Governments and better timing of issues. All thesecurities issued during 2006-07 so far were of 10-year maturity. The weighted averageyield, which had declined from nearly 13 per cent in 1997-98 to around 6 per cent in 2003-04, has progressively increased to around 8 per cent in 2006-07 so far.  State Governmentsecurities are, however, beset with the problem of negligible level of secondary marketliquidity. This has been attributed to certain interrelated factors such as, (i) low level ofoutstanding stock resulting in an even lower floating stock, (ii) predominance of buy-and-hold investors, (iii) disconnect between the uniform coupon fixed in respect of Statesparticipating in a tap issue with their corresponding secondary market yields, and (iv)fragmentation across issuers (28 States) and securities (each State issuing up to eight newsecurities in a year). With a view to improving the liquidity as also to widen the investor basein State Government securities, active consideration is being given to extend the facility ofnon-competitive bidding (currently limited to Central Government dated securities) to theprimary auction of State Government securities and also to introduce purchase and resale ofState Government securities by the Reserve Bank under the overnight LAF repo operations.VI. Development of the Corporate Bond MarketThe Reserve Bank plays an indirect role in the development of corporate bond market,essentially guided by its interest in monetary policy transmission, Government securities,and stability as well as efficiency in financial sector as a whole as banks have a major role inthe corporate bond market. While significant strides have been made in the development ofthe Government Securities market, the corporate debt market has a long way to go. Thoughthe corporate debt market in India has been in existence since independence in 1947, it wasonly after 1985-86, following some debt market reforms that State owned public enterprises(PSUs) began issuing PSU bonds. Such debt instruments, however, generally remainedhighly illiquid and unpopular among the  investors since a well-functioning secondary marketwas absent. However, corporates continued to prefer private placements to public issues.The predilection  towards private placement has been attributed to several factors, viz., easeof procedures and operation of private placement, involved procedure and considerablyhigher costs of public issues, and higher subscriptions for private placements. Mainly as aconsequence of this, the financial institutions have tended to dominate public issues in theprimary corporate debt market. The secondary market for corporate debt has also certain18shortcomings in terms of  lack of market-making resulting in poor liquidity, tendency on thepart of institutional investors to hold these securities to maturity and the consequentreduction in market supply of these securities.Several measures have been taken in the recent past to transform the corporate debtmarket in India. Some of these measures include de-materialisation and electronic transferof securities, rolling settlement, introduction of sophisticated risk management, trading andsettlement systems. Towards the end of 2003, SEBI also initiated reforms in the privateplacement market. In conjunction with these measures, Reserve Bank of India, issuedguidelines to banks on investment of their non-SLR securities. All these measures areexpected to improve the functioning of corporate debt market in India.The High Level Expert Committee on Corporate Bonds and Securitisation (Chairman: Dr. R.H. Patil) (2005) observed that the primary corporate debt market is dominated by privateplacements by essentially financial institutions (including banks and non-bankingcompanies) with fairly low levels of transparency until recently. Secondary market tradingand settlement procedures are rather archaic with settlement not even DvP based. There isa growing primary market for securitized instruments but hardly any trading activity is seen.In this background the Expert Committee had recommended measures to enhance activitylevel as well as efficiency of corporate debt markets. Some of the importantrecommendations relate to the following:(i) To encourage a well-developed primary issuance process, the Committee suggestedsteps to enhance the issuer base and investor base including measures to bring in retailinvestors. Listing of primary issues and creation of a centralized database of primary issueswas proposed to improve transparency and disclosure standards.(ii)  For an all-round development of the secondary market, the Committee recommended anelectronic trading system, a comprehensive automated trade reporting system and safe andefficient clearing and settlement standards. It was also suggested that repo in corporatebonds may be allowed (currently only Government securities are eligible collateral forrepos).The Committee also recommended a host of measures, including legal and tax aspects togive a boost to the securitized debt market, including suggestions to promote creditenhancement and creation of specialized debt funds to fund infrastructure projects. TheCommittee also suggested incentives for developments of a municipal bond market. Therecommendations have been accepted by the Government and are under implementation.19Securitisation2Securitisation as a financial instrument has been existing in India since the early 1990s \u2013essentially as a device of bilateral acquisitions of portfolios of finance companies.  Therewere quasi-securitisations for quite a while where creation of any form of security was rareand the portfolios simply moved from balance sheet of one originator over to that of another.These transactions often included provisions which provided recourse to the originator aswell. Now, loan sales is common through the direct assignment route, which is structuredusing the true sale concept. Securitisation of auto loans was the mainstay of the Indiansecuritization market through most the 1990s. Since 2000, residential mortgage backedsecurities has fuelled the growth in the market.In the early stage of securitization in India, creation of transferable securities in the form ofpass-through certificates (PTCs) was the most common form of securitization. PTC hasalmost become synonymous with securitisation in India and most market practitioners do notenvisage issuance of notes or bonds as a securitised product. There are PTCs which have aspecific coupon rate, there are structured PTCs and PTCs have different payback periods.Many PTCs are essentially derived debt instruments but they are not called as such.Over time, the market has spread into several asset classes \u2013 while auto loans andresidential housing loans are still the mainstay, there are corporate loans, commercialmortgage receivables, future flow, project receivables, toll revenues, etc that have beensecuritised.Trend in Structured Finance Issuance Volumes (in Rs. billion)Type FY 2002 FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 FY 2006ABS 12.9 36.4 80.9 222.9 178.5MBS 0.8 14.8 29.6 33.4 50.1CDO/LSO 19.1 24.3 28.3 25.8 21.0PF 4.0 1.9 0.0 16.0 0.0Others 0.0 0.4 0.5 10.0 6.8Total 36.8 77.7 139.2 308.2 256.5Source ICRARegulatory framework: T here is currently no regulatory framework for securitization marketin general. However, securitizations originated by RBI regulated entities viz. banks, FIs andNBFCs are governed by guidelines issued by RBI. Enactment of SARFAESI enabledsecuritiastion of NPAs by banks, which could sell off their NPAs to ARCs registered withRBI. More recently, RBI has issued guidelines for secutisation of standard assets by Banks,FIs and NBFC which are in accordance with international best practices in February 2006                                               2 This section draws mainly on the Patil Committee report on Corporate Bonds and Securitisation20which provides regulatory framework for several critical aspects of securitization. Recently,an amendment has been proposed to SCRA which recognizes pass-through certificates(PTC) as eligible securities to be listed and traded on exchanges.VII. Concluding ObservationsThe discussion in the previous Sections is indicative of the large ground that has sofar been covered by reforms in the Government securities market in India. It will also benoted that India, unlike amny other developing countries developed local currencyGovernment bond market with investors being largely domestic. Investment by foreigners indebt market is calibrated through overall limits.In this context, the extant macroeconomic conditions provide an ideal setting to carryforward the reform process in the G-Sec market. Indeed, an annual growth rate averagingover 8 per cent in the last three years; a savings rate of nearly 30 per cent; theentrenchment of a rule-based fiscal consolidation process; a modest current account deficit,low and rapidly declining level of external debt and a sharp build up of foreign exchangereserves, provide a conducive environment for further development of the G-Sec market.The inflation rate, which had declined substantially from its level in the first half of the 1990s,has remained fairly stable since then. The recent increase in the inflation rate to over 6 percent has engendered a host of countervailing measures by the Government and theReserve Bank to expeditiously realign the inflation rate within the stated range of 5.0 to 5.5per cent while continuing to pursue the medium-term goal of a ceiling on inflation at 5.0 percent. Continued stability in the inflation rate would positively impact on the development ofthe G-Sec market. Additionally, it would be imperative to adhere to the provisions of thefiscal responsibility legislations of both the Centre and the State Governments so as toenhance the credibility of fiscal policies, impart greater stability to financial markets andfurther strengthen macroeconomic fundamentals.  It would also be necessary to continue the efforts to develop a deep and liquid G-Sec market. Notwithstanding passive consolidation through reissuances, the number ofactively traded securities remains low relative to the number of securities outstanding. Thisresults in a kinked yield curve which impedes pricing of securities. The finer modalities forimplementing the scheme are being worked out.         The possibility of reintroducing instruments like Inflation-Indexed Bonds and FloatingRate Bonds is also being explored by addressing the observed infirmities in the earlier'avatars' of these instruments, as highlighted in Section II.21STRIPS could also be introduced with the enactment of the Government Securities Act thatwould facilitate lien marking and pledge of securities for raising loans against G-Secs.The need for appropriate risk management in the context of the G-Sec also needs to beemphasized. An important issue of concern is the lack of uniform accounting standards forderivatives and the lack of transparent appropriateness standards. In the interest ofsystemic safety, further developments in the derivatives markets in terms of moreinstruments and wider participation base also need to be synchronized with effectiveaccounting and disclosure norms in line with international best practices.As far as the corporate bond market is concerned, the Government of India\u2019sEconomic Survey 2006-07, observed that \u201c Outlook in infrastructure will depend on howinvestment in infrastructure is facilitated. Such investment requires long-term funds with longpay back periods, for example, from insurance and pension funds. Thus, success on theinfrastructure front will be facilitated by the development of a vibrant bond market, andpension and insurance reforms. \u201d (para 9.102) Further development of the corporate bondmarket would entail diversification and expansion of investor interest, which would, in turnnecessitate institutional measures for credit enhancement. This is already facilitated by theprevalence of credit rating institutions in India (all the three major rating agencies arerepresented in India). Credit risk could also be addressed by developing bond insuranceinstitutions. Institutional investors with superior risk assessment capacity along withinvestment capacity could also take on the role of credit enhancers. In addition, the issuerand instrument base needs to be widened through encouragement of segments likemunicipal bonds, mortgage backed securities and general securitized paper, in order tomeet the diverse requirements of investors and issuers in respect of the corporate bondmarket.22ANNEXIMF/World Bank Guidelines for Public Debt Management: The Indian PositionSr. No. Guideline Status1. Debt Management Objectives and Coordination1.1 Objectives The Reserve Bank of India, as the Government\u2019s debtmanager, is guided by the twin objectives of minimisationof interest cost over time and rollover risk.1.2 Scope The RBI manages the internal marketable debt  of theCentral Government by statute. Internal marketable debtaccounts for 40 per cent of the total outstanding debt ofthe Central Government, whereas net market borrowingsaccount for around 77 per cent of the GFD. The RBImanages the internal marketable debt of the StateGovernments under voluntary agreements. Internalmarketable debt accounts for around 20 per cent of thetotal outstanding liabilities of the State Governmentswhereas net market borrowings account for around 20 percent of their GFD.1.3 Coordinationwith monetaryand fiscalpoliciesWith a view to moving towards functional separationbetween debt management and monetary operations, theRBI constituted a new department viz., the FinancialMarkets Department in July 2005.Coordination between debt management, monetary andfiscal policies is achieved via (i) the Financial MarketsCommittee of the RBI that meets daily to review thedevelopments, on a daily basis, in various marketsegments and bring about co-ordination in monetary,exchange and debt management; (ii) the StandingCommittee on Cash and Debt Management that consistsof representatives of the Central Government and the RBIthat meets periodically to examine issues relating to debtmanagement and ensure co-ordination of various policyinstruments; (iii) a Standing Technical Committee hasbeen constituted recently with representatives from allState Governments, the Central Government and the RBIto advise on the wide-ranging issues relating to theborrowing programmes of Central and StateGovernments through a consensual and co-operativeapproach.2. Transparency and Accountability2.1 Clarity of Roles,Responsibilitiesand objectivesThe allocation of responsibilities between the CentralGovernment and the RBI (which is both the debt managerand the monetary authority) for the formulation andexecution of debt management policy is clearly defined bylaw (Constitutional provisions, RBI Act, GovernmentSecurities Act) and is publicly disclosed.The Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL) acts as aclearing house and a central counterparty throughnovation in the transactions of Government securities.23The objectives of debt management (as given in 1.1) areset out in the Annual Report of the RBI, as a part of thereview of debt management policy and operations.2.2 Open processfor formulatingand reporting ofdebtmanagementpoliciesRegulations and procedures for primary auctions, primarydealer activities and secondary market operations in G-Secs are publicly disclosed.2.3 Publicavailability ofinformation ondebtmanagementpoliciesThe budgets of the Central and State Governmentsprovide information on the past, present and futurebudgetary activities and the financing of the fiscal deficit.Government budgets are also analysed in variouspublications of the RBI including its Annual Report. Theconsolidated financial position of the Central and StateGovernments is reported in the RBI's Annual Report. Theconsolidated financial position of the Central and StateGovernments as also of their public sector enterprises isreported in the Central Government's annual EconomicSurvey.The budget of the Central Government providesinformation on the stock and composition of its debt andfinancial assets. Various aspects of the internalmarketable debt of the Central and State Governmentsare analysed in the RBI's Annual Report.Indicative auction calendars for dated securities andTreasury Bills of the Central Government are issued on ahalf-yearly basis and annual basis, respectively.The RBI announces auction results soon after the auctionvia press releases on its website.The RBI regularly issues statistical information on theprimary and secondary markets for Governmentsecurities. These can also be accessed on the RBI\u2019swebsite.Real time information on trades in Government securitieson the Negotiated Dealing System are issued on theRBI's website.2.4 Accountabilityand assurancesof integrity byagenciesresponsible fordebtmanagementThere is a system of annual statutory audit of the ReserveBank operations which covers the debt managementactivities. The debt management activities are alsocovered by concurrent audit. In addition, there is aninternal Management Audit and Systems Inspection whichfocuses on the macro management of debt activities. Theannual accounts of the RBI are audited by externalauditors and published in its Annual Report.3. Institutional Framework3.1 Governance As indicated in 2.1 above, the organizational frameworkfor debt management is clearly specified by law and themandates of the respective players are clear.24An annual review of debt management operations issubmitted to the central board of directors of the RBI.3.2 Management ofinternaloperations andlegaldocumentationDebt management activities are supported by an accurateand comprehensive management information system withproper safeguards.The debt manager has access to methodologies andmodels for cost-effective debt management. Debtmanagement is supported by an in-house researchdepartment which carries out analytical work periodically.The Reserve Bank of India has a Legal Department whichtenders legal advice, as and when necessary, on wide-ranging issues including debt management. Efforts aremade to ensure that all transactions and policy measureshave sound legal basis.4. DebtManagementStrategyAs indicated in 1.1 above, the Reserve Bank of India, asthe Government\u2019s debt manager, is guided by the twinobjectives of minimisation of interest cost over time androllover risk. An indicative calendar of G-secs is issued.Borrowing decisions are guided, inter-alia, by the(expected) cash flows of the Government, marketconditions, the repayment schedule and fiscal andmacroeconomic indicators.5. Risk Management Framework5.1 Scope forActiveManagementA policy of passive consolidation through reissuance/reopenings was started in 1999 in order to improvefungibility among the securities and to facilitateconsolidation of debtA scheme for active consolidation of G-Secs is beingframed in consultation with the Central Government.Stress testing is, however, yet to be introduced.5.2 ContingentLiabilitiesInformation on the guarantees of the Central and StateGovernments are collated and reported in variouspublications of the RBI including its Annual Report. TheFiscal Responsibility Legislations of the CentralGovernment and many of the State Governments providefor a ceiling on guarantees. The possible impact ofguarantees is taken into consideration in borrowingdecisions.6. Development and Maintenance of an Efficient Market for GovernmentSecurities6.1 PortfolioDiversificationand InstrumentsUsually plain vanilla bonds (of various maturities) areissued. Through the 1990s, various types of instrumentshave been introduced, like zero coupon bonds, capitalindexed bonds, floating rate bonds and bonds with calland put options.The introduction of STRIPs is being envisaged and will beundertaken as and when the enabling legislation isenacted.25Initiatives are continuously taken to broaden the investorbase for G-secs. Some of the measures include primarydealers, non-competitive bidding facility and promotion ofgilt mutual funds. Withholding tax (Tax Deducted atSource) has already been abolished for G-secs. FIIs arepermitted to invest in securities issued by the Central andState Governments by an incremental amount of 5 percent of total net issuance in the previous financial year.This is over and above the current stipulation ofinvestment up to US $ 2 billion.6.2 Primary Market Dated securities (of various maturities) and Treasury Bills(91-, 182- and 364-day tenor) of the Central Governmentare issued through competitive auctions. A non-competitive route is also available in respect of datedsecurities and Treasury Bills to encourage widerparticipation and retail holding. The issuance datedsecurities of the State Governments has progressivelytransited (completely) to the auction route in 2006-07 sofar.As per the provisions of the FRBM Act, the RBI cannotparticipate in the primary auctions of Central G-secs (RBIdoes not participate in the primary auctions of State G-secs).A system of Primary Dealers is in place for underwritingprimary issuances of G-secs.6.3 SecondaryMarketPursuance of sound monetary policy with the twinobjectives of price stability  and growth.Supporting market participants (FIMMDA, PDAI, etc) intheir efforts to develop codes of conduct for marketparticipants and to ensure best practices.Promotion of an active repo market.Removal of TDS from G-secs. G-secs are also notsubject to Securities Transaction Tax (STT) applicable toequities.An ordinance has recently been passed to remove thefloor (25 per cent) on SLR.Settlement of government securities and funds is beingdone on a Delivery vs. Payments (DvP) basis in thebooks of the RBI since 1995. With the introduction ofClearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL) in February2002, which acts as clearing house and a centralcounterparty, the problem of gridlock of settlements hasbeen reduced.Providing information on the G-Sec market on highfrequency basis.26References1.

Over the last decade, the profile of central banks has gone up. First, we ha d the Great Moderation - a period of extraordinary benign macroeconomic e nvironment globally, characterized by steady growth in advanced economies and accelerated growth in emerging economies, and low and stable inflation a ll around. Central banks took credit for this, believed they had discovered th e Holy Grail and declared victory.  2. That sense of triumph was dented by the crisis as central banks came to be blamed for policies and actions that got the world into the crisis. Even so, central banks battled the crisis from the frontlines and regained some of the lost reputation by acting quickly, decisively, a nd where required in concert,  to stabilize the global economy which was hurtling towards collapse. Over the last few months, fears of a double-dip recession have resurfaced, and governments in advanced countries are locked in a policy logjam over the balance between short-term fiscal stimulus and long term fiscal consolidation. This has willy-nilly pushed central banks to the fore once again as monetary stimulus is having to  bear the burden of being the first, and in some cases, possibly the only li ne of defence against recession.                                                   1 Comments of  Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Stern School of Business, New York University, September 26, 2011. 3. The crisis has been an intellectual challenge in many ways. It has tested the armoury of instruments available to centr al banks and the limits of their policy force. It has also reopened questions that we thought had been answered and renewed debates that we thought had been settled. My own experience has been that real world problems are too complex to fit templa te solution of text books. I want to use this opportunity that you ha ve provided me to communicate to you some of the complexities and dilemmas in real world policy making, and I will do so from the perspective of th e Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  What is the appropriate mo netary policy response to complex growth-inflation dynamics?  4. India recovered from the crisis soone r than even other emerging economies, but inflation too caught up with us sooner th an elsewhere. Inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), which act ually went into negative territory for a brief period in mid-2009, started rising in  late 2009, and it has remained around 9-10 per cent since January 2010 reflecting both supply and demand pressures. Supply pressures stemmed fr om elevated domestic food prices and rising global prices of oil and other commodities. The source of demand pressures was an economy with low per capita income which recovered sharply from the crisis. The supply pressures and demand pressures collided triggering a wider inflationary process.  5. In response to the inflat ionary pressures, the Reserve Bank began to reverse its accommodative monetary policy as ear ly as October 2009. We have been criticized for our anti-inflationary stance,  ironically from two different directions. From one side, we have been critici zed for being hawkish on inflation. The argument has been that our inflation is driven largely by supply shocks, particularly, since mid-2010, by high oil and other commodity prices, and that monetary policy should not respond to such  inflation. We will only end up hurting growth. The criticism from the other side has been that the Reserve Bank has been soft on inflation, the baby step approach we followed - of increasing policy interest rates by 25 bp each time - was not deterrent  enough, and that the persistence of inflation is a result of our delayed response.  Both these critiques cannot obviously be right at the same time. Let me offe r a response to them and in the process explain the rationale for our  anti-inflationary stance.  Monetary Policy Too Hawkish 6. My response to the doves is as follows. Admittedly, monetary policy is best suited to contain inflationary pressures stemming from the aggregate demand side. In that case, the policy pres cription is clear. If infla tion is high, tighten monetary policy; and if inflation is low, loosen monetary policy. Monetary policy options in the face of supply shocks ar e less straight forward. Wh ether monetary policy is effective in dealing with supply shocks  is therefore a ma tter of both academic debate and policy contention.   7. The conventional wisdom is that if inflation expectations  are well anchored, monetary policy need not react to suppl y shocks. This premise is based on two assumptions; first that the supply shocks are purely temporary, and second that supply shocks are the only ones driving in flation. These assumptions do not always hold. In the real world, oftentimes supply shocks lead to a permanent trend upward shift in prices. Also, sometimes, demand pressures combine with supply shocks to stoke inflationary pressures.   8. A good illustration of the first assumption - mean reverting supply shocks - not holding comes from the world prices of oil whic h have trended up on a long period basis. International crude oil prices  recorded an annual average increase of around 17 per cent during the 2000s as agains t only a modest increase of 2 per cent during the 1990s and a decline of 3 per cen t during the 1980s. This obviously is the outcome of structural changes in supply and demand for oil. Monetary policy has to recognize these underlying tren ds and respond to them. If it looks upon these trends as pure transient supply shocks and ignores them, it runs the risk of destabilizing inflation expectations.  9. And now about the second assumption - of supply shocks not usually acting alone to stoke inflation. The shifting driver s of inflation in India over the past year and a half offer a good illustration. The increase in global commodity prices coincided with rapidly rising demand at ho me. GDP grew at 8.5 per cent last year (2010/11), faster than the trend growth rate  which is now estimated to be of the order of 8 per cent. In an environment of  rapid growth and hi gh capacity utilization, corporates regained pricing power and were able to pass th rough the increase in input prices to higher output prices thus fu elling generalized inflationary pressures.   10. Similar dynamics were at play on the food front. Rising incomes, especially in rural areas, have resulted in a shift in dietary habits away from cereals and toward protein-based foods. This is a stru ctural change and monetary policy will be misled if it treats this as  a one-off supply shock. Given the high share of food in the various consumer price indices (46% - 70%), persistent supply pressures on the food front can fuel inflation expectati ons; and in the face of growing demand pressures, rising inflation expectations can trigger a wage-price spiral. Recent reports that real wages of rural labour have gone up mark edly suggest that such a wage-price spiral may already be under way.  11. To summarize, the inflation that we have experienced over the last nearly twenty months is a result of a combination of supply shocks that had a trend impact on prices as well as demand pressures. Give n the nature of the inflation drivers and their combined impact, clearly there is a significant role for monetary policy in combating inflation. Our monetary policy stance is guided by this understanding, and is aimed at restraining demand a nd anchoring inflation expectations. The argument of our critics that monetary policy has no role because inflation is a result of imported commodity prices would have b een valid if the increase in commodity prices was a pure and transien t supply shock or if there were no demand pressures. That clearly was not the case in India.   Monetary Tightening Hurts Growth 12. Another argument made in this line of criticism is that monetary policy tightening is hurting growth. I believe a much more nuanced evaluation of our policy stance is necessary. Evidence from empirical research suggests that the relationship between growth and inflation is  non-linear. At low in flation and stable inflation expectations, there is a trade-o ff between growth and inflation. But above a certain threshold level of  inflation, this relationshi p reverses, the trade-off disappears, and high inflation actually st arts taking a toll on growth. Estimates by the Reserve Bank using differe nt methodologies put the thre shold level of inflation in the range of 4% - 6%. With WPI inflation ruling above 9 per cent, we are way past the threshold. At this high level, inflation is unambiguously inimical to growth; it saps investor confidence and er odes medium term growth prospects. The Reserve Bank\u2019s monetary tightening is accordingly geared towards safeguarding medium term growth even if it means so me sacrifice in near term growth.   Monetary Policy Behind the Curve  13. Now let me turn to the criticism fr om the opposite side - that the Reserve Bank was slow in closing the monetary spig ots, that our \u2018baby step\u2019 approach was inadequate to tame the inflationary pre ssures, and that we are having to tighten aggressively lately to make up for lost time.   14. This criticism fails to appreciate the context - the nature of domestic inflation and global uncertainty - in which we were operating. The calibration of our monetary tightening was guided by the changing drivers of inflation over the course of fiscal year 2010/11. Early on in the year, inflation pressures had their origin in food prices, and accordingly our  monetary policy response was aimed at containing the spillover risk to non-food inflation. Note that policy rates had gone down to historically low levels during the crisis, and an abrupt  adjustment would have disrupted the market. Our judgement, therefore, was that tightening should be done gradually, in small steps, so as to allow time for the banks and the private sector to adjust to a higher interest rate environment.   15. The inflation scenario change d starting August 2010 when global commodity prices surged higher than anticipated. Global oil prices came under further pressure starting January 2011 because of political developments in the Middle East and North-Africa. Also, as I had indicated earlier, because of the narrowing of the output gap, producers were able to pass on higher input prices to higher output prices leading to inflati onary pressures getting generalized as evidenced by the increase in non-food ma nufactured product inflation from 5.3 per cent per cent in August 2010 to  8.5 per cent in March 2011. We responded to these changes in underlying drivers of inflation by tightening more aggressively starting May 2011.   16. The second factor relevant in the \u2018behi nd the curve\u2019 debate is that we also had to contend with an uncertain global recovery. Even as there was some talk of spring shoots in April 2010, the optimism di d not last; soon thereafter, the Greek sovereign debt crisis and unemployment concerns in the US revived concerns about the pace and shape of global recovery. These uncertainties increased both in nature and size as time passed with the euro area sovereign debt problem not only spreading but proving to be intractable, th e US recovery stalli ng and the Japanese economy assaulted by an unprecedented natural disaster. Our \u2018baby step\u2019 approach during 2010 was accordingly a delicate balancing act between supporting recovery at home amidst growing global uncertainty  and containing inflation pressures.   17. If the above factors are reckoned w ith, the \u2018behind-the-curve\u2019 argument loses potency. Starting in March 2010, we ha ve so far raised policy interest rates (the repo rate) by 350 bp. The effective ti ghtening has been even more, 500 bp, as the operational policy rate shifted from reve rse repo rate (absorption mode) to repo rate (infusion mode).   18. In offering a response to the criticis m of our monetary policy stance from both sides, my endeavour has been to co mmunicate to you th at every monetary policy action involves complex judgement. Th e supply shocks we confront in the real world are different from pure text book versions; oftentimes they coincide with rising demand pressures. We have to bala nce growth-inflation concerns. On top of that, monetary policy actions need to be forward looking even in the face of external uncertainty. This in essence is the dilemma of moneta ry policy decisions.   How do you justify liquidity injection in the midst of a tightening cycle? 19. The conventional tools of monetary po licy are controls over the volume of money (liquidity) and the price of money (policy intere st rate). Typically an expansionary stance would involve ea sing both the rate and volume, and conversely, a contractionary stance w ould involve tightening both of them. Occasionally, there arise situations when the price and volume instruments are deployed in opposite directions - for exampl e, injecting liquidity amidst a rate tightening cycle - that call for both cau tious judgement and extra effort at communication.   20. In understanding the motive force for liquidity adjustme nt by a central bank, it must be noted that a growing econom y requires the central bank to inject primary liquidity to meet the requirement for currency and credit. This injection can come about only through an expansion of  the reserve (base) money. In the first instance, liquidity injection happens through overnight borrowing by banks under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF). If the liquidity shortage is of a durable nature, the central bank needs to meet that need through outright open market operations (OMOs) by buying government securities.   21. As we progressed with monetary  tightening through 2010, the LAF window shifted from a surplus (absorption) mode to a deficit (injection) mode. This was consistent with our anti-inflationary stan ce since a deficit liquidity situation would improve monetary transmission. We had also indicated clearly that  it would be the endeavour of the Reserve Bank to maintain  the absorption or injection through the LAF window at about \u00b1 1 per cent of the net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of banks. However, towards the second half  of 2010, systemic liquidity tightened further pushing the injec tion through the LAF window beyond 1 per cent of NDTL. This was owing to a combination of struct ural and one-off factors. Recognizing that the deficit in systemic liquidity was of a durable nature, the Reserve Bank conducted outright OMOs to inject liquidity of a durable nature.  22. This liquidity injection through OMOs happened at a time when we were tightening policy rates to combat inflat ion. These were seemingly contrarian actions, and many observers may have seen them as being conflicting and incoherent. We realized that there was a communication challenge here - to explain to the market that we remained committed to bringing inflation down, that our action in injecting liquidity was not inconsis tent with our anti-i nflation stance, that we continued to hold that liquidity shoul d be in a deficit mode in a monetary tightening cycle, but that we were injec ting liquidity only to ease the \u2018excessive deficit\u2019 in order to ensure that flow of credit for productiv e purposes was not choked.   23. Informed market participants did of course understand the rationale for our actions. But we recognized the importance of communicating the rationale to the larger public. If people got confused policy signals a nd believed thereby that the central bank\u2019s commitment to inflation control was not credible, inflation expectations would get unhinged and that would erode the effec tiveness of our anti-inflation strategy. We, therefore, went the extra mile to communicate the rationale at a non-technical level.  Forward Guidance: How transparent can/should a central bank be? 24. Received wisdom today is that successful monetary policy is not just a matter of effective calibration of overnight in terest rates, but also of shaping market expectations of the way in which interest rates, inflation and income are likely to evolve on the way forward. Among the important instruments used by central banks for this purpose is the \u2018forward guida nce\u2019 they give in their monetary policy statements.   25. The practice of giving forward guidance varies across central banks. By far the most explicit has been the Bank of Canada which, given th e uncertainty during the crisis, gave a definite timeframe until which it would keep ove rnight rate at the \u2018current\u2019 level, subject of course to  the outlook for inflation. The ECB has traditionally been less explicit on the ground that policy commitment is not possible in an uncertain macro environm ent. The US Fed has a more credible record of using forward guidance to shap e and manage expectations. For over two years since the crisis, the Fed had guide d the markets by saying that \u2018economic conditions are likely to warra nt exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period\u2019. In its most recent statement of August 9, 2011, the Fed quantified \u2018extended period\u2019 as \u2018at l east upto mid-2013\u2019, thereby giving a more definitive time frame for market participants  to plan. The Fed evidently expects that by reducing uncertainty, at least in one dimension (time dimension), the forward guidance will help stimulate demand.   26. Giving forward guidance is not alwa ys necessarily a positive sum game. Central banks face several dilemmas. The fi rst is how exactly is the conditionality surrounding the guidance to be worded. It cannot be so vague as to lose all content value; on the other hand, it cannot be so precise that the central bank becomes a prisoner of its words and loses any flexib ility to deviate from  the guidance should the underlying circumstances change. A s econd, and related, dilemma is how to ensure that the market correctly appr eciates the conditiona lity and does not interpret the guidance as an  irrevocable commitment.   27. Starting early 2010, in keeping with th e best practice, the Reserve Bank too has begun giving forward guidance. And as expected, we too ha ve confronted the classic communication dilemma. Let me illust rate. In the First Quarter Review of July 2011, we said: \u201cGoing forward, the monetary policy stance will depend on the evolving inflation trajectory, which in turn, will be determined by trends in domestic growth and global commodity prices. A change in stance will be motivat ed by signs of a sustainable downturn in inflation.\u201d   28. Simultaneously, we also noted that the stance of monetary policy will be to \u201cmanage the risk of growth fall ing significantly below trend\u201d.   29. Reading the two statements together, some analysts have criticized the guidance for its lack of precision; more specifically, there were questions like, \u2018what is the trend growth ra te\u2019 and \u2018how much deviati on from trend would the RBI tolerate\u2019. This was valid criticism and these questions were relevant. With our trend growth rate, post-crisis, estimated at 8 pe r cent, the balance of  policy stance would shift if growth fell consistently and substantially below that rate. But a shift in stance will also be a function of the behaviour of the external and internal drivers of inflation. What we said in response to the criticism therefore was that defining precisely \u2018what significantly below trend\u2019 ex-ante was difficult, and that the ambiguity in the guidance was deliberate because it was unavoidable.   30. Central to this whole issue of forwar d guidance is that a central bank is handicapped by external uncertainty over wh ich it has no control. The crisis has brought this dilemma into sharp focus. On the one hand, central banks want to use the instrumentality of forward guidan ce to manage expectations, and even outcomes; on the other hand, they cannot be  precise enough because of external uncertainty. How to communicate monetary po licy so that the be nefit-cost balance is positive is yet another d ilemma for central banks.  Should monetary policy respond to asset prices? 31. Among the many questions thrown up by th e crisis is one about the role of central banks in dealing with asset pr ice bubbles. The broadly accepted theology before the crisis - although not the only  view - was the Greenspan orthodoxy which can be summarized as follows. First, asset price bubbles are hard to identify in real time, and the fundamental fact ors that drive asset prices are not directly observable. A central bank should not therefore sec ond guess the market. Second, monetary policy is too blunt an instrument to count eract asset price booms. And third, central banks can \u2018clean up the mess\u2019 after the bubble bursts. The surmise therefore was that the cost-benefit calculus of a more activist monetary stance of \u201cleaning against the wind\u201d was clearly negative. In other wo rds, it is not the j ob of central bankers to remove the punch bowl no matter that the party is getting wild. 32. The crisis has dented the credib ility of the Greenspan orthodoxy. The emerging view post-crisis is that central banks cannot remain indifferent to asset price bubbles. However, it has thrown up a debate over what should be the role of the central bank and how that role might aff ect its other responsibilities, and indeed its autonomy. The debate is still fluid and there are no conclusive answers. Nevertheless, it has helped in crystallizing some views to guide the way forward. Let me discuss some of them.  33. As much as the pre-crisis orthodoxy about not deploying monetary policy in aid of asset price management has now lost  its potency, reservations persist about its efficacy. The essence of the argument is  that the typical monetary policy action of raising policy interest rate in sma ll steps of 25-50 basis points will not help contain the surge in asset prices. On  the other hand, monetary policy action aggressive enough to deter asset price build  up will take a heavy toll on the real economy. A consensus is building around the view that the most  appropriate way of addressing asset prices is through macroprudential instruments, either independently or in conjunction with monetary policy. Indeed, macroprudential instruments are at the heart of the Ba sel 3 package which was agreed upon last year.  34. Macroprudential policies are neat in concept but throw up a host of problems in operation. The t ools of macroprudential polic y such as capital norms, countercyclical buffers and risk weights fall within the domain of regulation. But there also has to be consistency between  the monetary stan ce and macroprudential policy. Does this then mean th at the central bank should al so have responsibility for bank regulation? If on the other hand, the responsibilities are distributed across different agencies, what should be the platform and protocol for coordination? What should be the role  of the government?   35. Indeed, the post-crisis trend has been  to entrust macroprudential supervision to central banks, and where cen tral banks already have this  responsibility, to define it more explicitly. While there could be some synergies in that, there are also questions about potential c onflicts of interest such as when, for example, the macroeconomic situation may require a tight  monetary policy, but the central bank may demur because such tightening may rais e concerns about the stability of the banking system. Some people argue t hough that potential conflicts between monetary policy and macroprudential polic y are being exaggerated. In entrusting responsibility for macroprude ntial supervision, and mo re broadly for financial stability, to central banks, there are con cerns also about how this responsibility, might impact the prized autonomy of central banks. This apprehension arises because macroprudential decisions entail a greater element of subjective judgement than do monetary policy decisions, and if that be the case, it opens up scope for interference from the outside.  36. My attempt as above has been only to give you a flavour of the many complex questions thrown up by this issu e of central bank responsibility for asset price management, indeed more broadly fo r financial stability. The scope of this lecture does not permit a detailed assessment of the debate. But let me give you the Reserve Bank perspective on this.  37. The Reserve Bank has traditionally had a much broader mandate, including responsibility for some development func tions, than is typical of advanced economy central banks. Our experience in regard to simultaneously managing both monetary policy and macroprudential policy has been positive, indeed synergistic. Asset price trends are one of the many vari ables we take into account in monetary policy calibration. We have used conventi onal monetary policy in struments such as policy interest rates if demand pressure s are across board. On the other hand, if demand pressures are confined to specific sectors, we have found it more efficient to use macroprudential instruments such as  risk weights and provisioning norms so as to put sand in the wheels of credit flowin g to those sectors. We have also used macroprudential instruments symmetrically - tightening in times of excess demand as, for example, in the years before the crisis, and easing in times of slackening demand, for example, as part of the crisis response.   38. Even as macroprudential policies have become the talk of the town post-crisis, deploying them requires careful j udgement. In order to make a judgement, a central bank has to ascertain if the asset price build up is driven by \u2018excessive leverage\u2019 and if the price build up is acro ss board or confined to specific sectors. By far the most important thing to remember in deploying macroprudential policies is that, with the benefit of hindsight, all conservative policies look safe. But excessive conservatism in order to be prep ared to ride out a potential crisis could thwart financial innovation a nd progress. It is this balance between preventing instability and promoting i nnovation that central banks have to learn to manage. And this is especially important in an  emerging market economy like India where the responsibility of the central bank for market development, though not explicit, is nonetheless quite  important.   How should monetary policy manage the interface with fiscal policy?  39. The seventy odd years since the Great  Depression saw a famous rivalry between fiscal and monetary policies for in fluence. For much of this period, almost across the developed world, Keynesian theo logy ruled, fiscal policy dominated and monetary policy remained subservient to  that. The stagflation of the 1970s, the influential monetarist views of Friedman et al and the apparent success of supply side policies to tame inflation prompted a shift in thinking aw ay from full bodied Keynesianism. Also important were the theo retical analysis of discretion vs. rules in setting monetary policy. Together, th e theoretical advances and empirical evidence allowed monetary policy to wean itself away from fiscal dominance and central banks started asserting their autonomy.   40. Even as the advantages of having an apolitical m onetary authority as an effective counterpoise to politically driven  fiscal policies were becoming evident, democratic compulsions made fiscal disc ipline increasingly difficult. To get around this, starting 1990s, several countries voluntarily enacted fiscal responsibility laws. The laws imposed limits on fiscal deficits/public debt on the one hand and prohibited primary financing of the fiscal  deficit by the central bank on the other. This institutional framework allowed operational independence to the central bank in its conduct of monetary policy within a rule-based regime and was successful in keeping inflation low.   41. The rule based fiscal regimes unravelled during the crisis as both governments and central banks implement ed expansionary policies in close coordination. While such coordination duri ng the crisis was not questioned except by extreme purists, now in the recovery pe riod, several fundamental concerns are resurfacing. At the heart of these concerns is whether monetary policy is once again becoming hostage to fiscal compulsions? The specifics of the debate vary but the basic issues are similar. In the US, the debate is over the trade-off between short-term fiscal stimulus and long-term fis cal consolidation. In the euro area, the question is about the shared benefits of  a monetary union without the shared responsibilities of a fiscal union. The questions  all around are: Are central banks being forced beyond their comfort zone to maintain expansionary monetary stances to compensate for fiscal laxity? Aren\u2019t th e so called unconventional monetary actions thinly veiled fiscal measures?  Aren\u2019t central banks, in the process, compromising their basic commitment to price stability? Are central banks becoming vulnerable to political pressures?  Is their autonomy at risk? The answers to these questions will be shaped by how the current big issues are settled.   42. As in many economies, in India too, monetary policy was dominated by fiscal considerations during the 1970s and the 1980s. Large and growing fiscal deficits ended up being financed by the Reserve Bank. This led to more than desired growth in base m oney and money supply which ul timately reflected in high inflation. Like other economies, we t oo put in place a fiscal responsibility legislation - the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003 - with ceilings on deficit and debt ra tios and provisions prohibiting primary financing of government debt by the cen tral bank. These provi sions facilitated fiscal consolidation during 2003-08 and afforded the Reserve Bank the necessary flexibility to implement monetary policy aimed at low and stable inflation.    43. Like elsewhere in the world, both mone tary and fiscal policies were eased in India too in response to the crisis. In pa rticular, this meant interrupting the fiscal consolidation process enjoined by the FRBM Act. As India emerged from the crisis, the Government adopted a revised road map for fiscal  consolidation as recommended by the Thirteenth Finance Commission. Nevertheless, meeting the road map targets is going to be a fo rmidable challenge. The quantum of non-discretionary expenditure (sal aries, pensions, interest payments) is large and this cannot be adjusted easily, at any rate in the short-term. By far the largest component of discretionary expenditure is on subsidies - on food, fertilizer and petroleum products. In reducing these subs idies, there is inevitably a tension between democratic compulsions and econom ic virtue. Even as the Government pursues a quantitative target, it also has to be mindful of the quality of fiscal adjustment - that is to prune unproduc tive expenditure and increase productive expenditure which is necessary for rais ing the potential outpu t of the economy.  44. As I said, the Reserve Bank has been battling inflation for the last twenty months. Monetary tightening, as is well known, works by restraining demand. In as much as the fiscal stance is supportive of demand, the monetary stance has had to be more aggressive than otherwise. For monetary policy to be more supportive of growth, it will be necessary for fiscal consolidation to take root more firmly.   45. The dilemma for monetary policy in I ndia is thus somewhat different from that of the advanced economies. The d ilemma for advanced economy central banks is whether monetary policy is having to be kept more accommodative than necessary to offset fiscal contraction. In  contrast, the dilemma for the Reserve Bank is whether monetary policy is having to be  tightened that much more because of fiscal demand.  Conclusion 46. In my remarks today, I have tried to  present to you some of the dilemmas we confront in monetary policy management . All central banks c onfront these, with differences in the extent and timing. I have tried to give you the Reserve Bank perspective on these. The message I tried to convey is that there are no template answers to real life policy issues. Analysis is important, but judgement is crucial. I believe a two way communication between central practitioners  and central bank scholars will help in sharpening bot h our analysis and judgement.  ", "3 Sep 05 MP.pdf": "MONETARY CO-OPERATION IN ASIA 1Mr. Chairman and distinguished participants,It is a privilege to be associated with the deliberation s on Asian Integration.Singapore very vividly signifies both the diversity and poten tial for prosperity of the Asian region.  We deeply appreciate the hospitality and excellent arrangements made by the IMF and MAS for this High Level Seminar. The di scussion paper circulated by the MAS is of high quality and is a very useful document. This session is devoted to subjects of special interest to Central Banks, namely \u201cEnhan cing RegionalSurveillance and Monetary Co-operation in Asia\u201d.  I int end focusing on one of the topics flagged for discussion in this session by the organizers,  namely \u201cIs there scope for co-operation or co-ordination on exchange rate pol icies over the long term?\u201d 2. In this brief presentation, I propose to explore the  following areas : First,changing dynamics of exchange rate regimes in Asia; second, importance of the Asian economies for global prosperity and stability; third , the Asian dynamics offinancial integration, fourth, the scope for co-operati on or co-ordination on exchange rate policies; and finally, some thoughts specific to the I ndian situation.Changing dynamics of exchange rate regimes in Asia 3. In the period prior to the 1997 crisis, many of the A sian economies followed an exchange rate regime of fixed but adjustable pegs. Dur ing the East Asian crisis, it was realized that such pegs were quite vulnerable to speculati ve attacks. Several EastAsian economies have adopted different types of exchange r ate regimes in the post- crisis period. While some countries continued with pegged regimes, others moved over to some kind of managed floats.4. Thus, it appears that in most economies of Asia, the w eight of experience seems to be tilted in favour of intermediate regimes, a nd post-crisis, the choice of the exchange rate regimes generally reveals a growing prefer ence for relatively more flexible exchange rates than before. In this regard, gi ven the current state of relatively benign international financial market conditions, it is possible to speculate that as the comfort level of forex reserves as self insurance is reached, and institutions and                                                 1 Speech by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank o f India at the IMF-MAS High-Level Seminar on Asian Integration held on September 3, 2005 at Sing apore.financial markets in Asian economies acquire further resili ence, this shift in preference might grow stronger and wider. The recent moves by the C hinese and the Malaysian authorities would only substantiate such a notion.5. An intermediate managed floating regime may not sou nd technically a perfectsystem but, prima facie , it has proven to be the most pragmatic which explains itspopularity.  The built-in flexibility allows the domest ic currency to be responsive to market forces, while it meets the concern of the authorit ies for \u2018basic stability\u2019 and orderly movement in forex markets. In contrast to a pure  float, this mechanism can prevent excessive exchange rate volatility that can have adve rse impacts on externaltrade and investment.  In other words, rather than bei ng distracted by a quest for the \u2018perfect system\u2019, perhaps it is wise to focus on improving th e working of any given floatregime.  The real issue in this regard relates to how m uch of a float is envisaged and the nature, magnitudes as well as instruments of its man agement.  These would depend on several factors, especially the changing contours b etween flexibility and volatility in each economy.6. The recent record of very impressive growth in Asia has be en driven by trade and cross-border investment flows.  The rapid strides achieve d by China have provided a powerful stimulus for regional expansion.  Bu t it is the nature of trade flows as much as their impressive scale that is shaping economic rela tionships and prospects. While much of this trade involves production of g oods, still ultimately destined for the North American and European markets, i t also reflects an increased division of labour, product specialization and integrati on within the region.  Together with this, fundamental shifts in economic relations are a lso taking place.7. Many of the intra-Asia trade flows, which correspond to  the internationaldivision of labour between Asian countries, are flows of  exports of components and spares but not of finished goods for their end consumers.  A crucial question for some countries in the region is the level of income that woul d enable domestic demand to become the main driving force of growth.  As domestic dem and, notably household sector demand, becomes the driver of growth, movement to a more flexible exchange rate policy would be feasible.8. Similarly, as the corporates as well as financial inter mediaries, especially banks equip themselves to manage movements in exchange rate, gr eater flexibility would be feasible, as forex markets also would tend to become less vo latile. It is also necessary in this regard to recognize the \u2018insurance\u2019 in the form of foreign exchange reserves needed against potentially volatile capital flows which sh ould be sufficient to take care of fluctuations in capital flows and \u2018liquidity at risk\u2019. It is generally felt that reserves would act as a circuit breaker for situations when unidire ctional expectations become self-fulfilling. The swap arrangements among the Centr al Banks such as the one under Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI) add to the level of  \u2018insurance\u2019 and hence to the comfort factor to the Central Banks in dealing with exce ss volatility in capital flows.9. Recently there has been considerable expansion in global  liquidity but this should not dilute the vigil of policy makers in regard to  volatility in capital flows.  Very often, it is difficult to assess, ex ante , whether capital flows are temporary or permanent.  It is prudent for policy makers to assume tha t they are reversible till they are proven to be enduring. Impact on real economy of sig nificant reverse movements over a relatively short period could be destabilizing wit h attendant serious welfare implications.  We in Asia are acutely aware of these aspect s.  Recent sharp upward movements in oil prices in an era of heightened uncertai nties is yet another reason for policy makers in Asia to be vigilant.  The hikes in oil pri ces tend to have adverse consequences for growth and prices in several of our economi es but they also have significant impact on external sector, encompassing both cu rrent and capital accounts.On current account, the trade deficit will tend to wide n.  On capital account, surpluses generated in oil exporting countries may add to global liquidity and lead to large capital inflows to emerging markets that are net import ers of oil. Hence, a carefulassessment of the medium term sustainability would be impe rative.10. Over the medium to longer term, the exchange rate regimes and related policies are likely to be influenced by (a) the confidence  in the strength of Asian economies; (b) perceived resilience of their economic as wel l as financial systems; (c) growing economic and financial integration amongst Asia n economies; (d) emerging significance of Asian economies in the global economy; (e)  the state of internationalfinancial architecture and market conditions and (f) poli cy-induced measures for co- operation and co-ordination amongst Asian economies.Importance of Asian economies and policies 11. The fact that the Asian economies have recovered swiftly after the crises of1997 is an important consideration in viewing the futur e external developments.  The growth rate of developing Asia, which had plummeted to  4.2 per cent in 1998,recovered quickly to 6.2 per cent in 1999, rising further to 6.6 per cent in the year 2000. In the more recent period, the recovery in the ou tput of the Asian economies has been robust with developing Asia growing by nearly 8 per cent in 2003 and 2004.It is widely recognized that the contribution of Asia to global growth has generally been very impressive in recent years, and may continue to be so, for several years in future.  The current account on the balance of payments h as been in surplus for many if not all Asian economies. The private capital flows to the emerging Asia have recovered from an outflow of US $ 52 billion in 1998 to an inflow of US $ 151 billion in 2004.  At the same time, the reserve build up in the r egion has been significant.12. In the backdrop of the resilience of the Asian economi es and their ability to bounce back after a deep financial crisis, there is resurgen ce of confidence in their future. Strategies in the form of having mutual swap a greements under the Chiang Mai initiative, to guard against speculative attacks, could now be enlarged, and could also be supplemented by greater co-operation and co-ordi nation in the exchange rate regimes and policies.13. Indeed, from a longer-term perspective, we must note  that Asia is appropriately poised in terms of abundance in factors of production \u2013 l abour and capital \u2013 particularly labour, as the demography is clearly in favour  of Asia to sustain a long- term growth. The emergence of surplus factors of producti on in Asia combined with financial strength would impact prices, wages and exchange  rates.  Asian economies could explore strategies to evolve a system whereby they could  not only prevent and,if necessary, manage financial crises on their own to the e xtent possible, but also play a more active role in co-ordinating policies with other  major developed economies.These arrangements could be consistent with continued and an active role of IMF in international monetary cooperation.14. It is useful to recall that the acute sense of interde pendence aroused by the financial \u201ccontagion\u201d in 1997 convinced the Asian economie s of the importance ofeconomic cooperation, one that reflected their common in terests and priorities as wellas strengthened their voice in the global arena. Among others, this led to two parallelmovements \u2013 one in South Asia in the form of the SAARC  Initiative and the other in East Asia reflecting the ASEAN+3 Initiative.15. The idea of having an integrated financial system so a s to provide viable \u2018safety net\u2019 in times of crisis germinated. As a result, the idea  of \u201cASEAN + 3\u201d Initiative 2gained prominence. This, in turn, was reflected in two correlated developments. First,in 2000, ASEAN+3 countries mutually agreed to form a n etwork of bilateral swap agreements to provide mutual protection from financial emergencies, popularly known as the Chiang Mai Initiative. More recently, there has b een a resurgence in the debate on the formation of an Asian Monetary Fund and the ad option of an Asian Currency Unit. Concomitantly, reflecting the parallel developmen ts under the ASEAN+3 Initiative, there has been wider discussion and debate on  the formation of a South Asian Economic Union and a South Asian Development Ban k 3. Second, the Asian Bond Fund  Initiative 4 was launched in 2003 reflecting the effort to develop a regionalbond market for catering to the medium and long term financing needs of the Asian economies.Asian dynamics of financial integration 16. It is useful to recognize that, there are several impo rtant factors that are relevant for considering greater financial integration in Asia.  First, the wide diversity in the level of economic development across the region. Second , the divergent level offinancial sector development across the region. Third, the  limited scope of the existing intra-region resource-pooling mechanism and the lack of i nstitutional frameworks.Fourth, the presence of asynchronous business cycles amongst the countries in the region. Such divergences are aptly reflected in the asymmet ric transmission ofdemand and monetary shocks in the region.17. There are significant developments that point to eme rgence of enabling factors for strengthening of economic integration in Asia.  Fi rst, emerging Asia fares quite wellin terms of factor mobility and wage and price flexibi lity. Second, the trade intensity ratios in emerging Asia, particularly the ASEAN region,  are quite high and are likely to accelerate. Further, Foreign Direct Investment flows with in the region are significant.Third, tariffs are being brought down rapidly.  Four th, the free trade agreements are                                                 2 The ASEAN + 3 was formed as a gathering of the gov ernments of ASEAN members, China, Korea and Japan that were Asian members of ASEM, had its first leaders\u2019 meeting in December 1997.3 The SAARC Council of Ministers meeting held in Isl amabad during January 2-3, 2004, desired thatthe SAARCFINANCE should prepare a concept paper on the proposed South Asian Economic Union and a South Asian Development Bank.4 The Asian Bond Fund is basically an arrangement for  pooling of a portion of foreign exchange reserves of few East Asia and Pacific countries and  the Fund portfolio is invested in the liquid US do llar denominated bonds of major Asian economies.expanding and deepening making the prospects of tariff- free and virtual trade integration in Asia sooner than later.  Fifth, there  is a strong commitment of politicalleadership in Asia to focus on economic issues. There are re gular and frequent close interactions among Central Bank Governors in Asia which sho uld strengthen the process of cooperation.Scope for co-operation and co-ordination 18. The Chiang Mai Initiative is a good starting point to build on the various existing initiatives. Although under the present dispensation th e CMI is complementary to similar IMF initiatives, it has an important symbolic valu e in as much as it can signalthe markets a regional commitment to supporting any mem ber country\u2019s currency thatis under speculative pressures. It also recognizes that establ ishing swap arrangements does not obviate the need to address structur al and financial sector weaknesses.  It may also be added that while CMI might have contributed to the exchange rate stability in the region, it has also contri buted to closer regionaleconomic and financial integration and co-operation.  It is useful to discuss ways ofcarrying this process forward.19. There are several fora already established for region al monetary cooperation.The Asian Clearing Union (ACU), which was established in  1974 at the initiative of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (ESCAP ) has eight member central banks.  The main objective of the ACU is to provid e a facility to settle currentinternational transactions among members on multilatera l net settlement basis.  The ACU mechanism also provides for a currency swap type mechanism amongstmembers for trade transactions. ACU aims to promote mone tary co-operation amongst the members and has also resulted in closer relat ions across the banking systems of the member countries. During the last few years t rade settled through ACU mechanism has grown at a rate higher than that of tota l international trade of the member countries.20. Yet another forum for exchange of views and experie nces, including through visits and training programmes, is SAARCFINANCE.  Areas  covered in recentmonths include communication policies and practices of Centr al Banks and Real Time Gross Settlement systems.21.  The recent policy shift in China from a pegged to a  flexible exchange rate regime is a significant development in international fi nance. This step is a watershed in the financial sector reform process now underway in Chi na.  Going by the available indications, China has long-term plans for development of deep and liquid markets in financial assets, which would encompass foreign exchange, bo nds, and equities, as also commodities.Some thoughts on India\u2019s approach 22. It may be useful to recall our experience with exchan ge rate management in India. In September 1975, the Government of India pr oposed a system of determining the exchange rate based on a basket of five currencies, wit h weighting, based essentially though not entirely, on trade weights. The p ermissible range for the exchange rate was 2.25 per cent on either side.  The cur rencies chosen were US Dollar, Pound Sterling, Deutsche Mark, Japanese Yen and SDR.  The weights were revised in 1979, 1983 and 1984, though the currency compo sition broadly remained the same with only one change in 1984 when French Franc replaced SDR. The band,however, was extended from 2.25 to 5.0 per cent in 197 9 and from 5 to 10 per cent in 1986.  Soon after the devaluation of the rupee in Jul y 1991, there was a move in March 1992 to a regime of partial convertibility (essenti ally a dual exchange rate). In March 1993 the regime changed to a uniform exchange ra te of the rupee which was market-determined \u2013 a system which remains in place to da te. In August 1994, India moved over to current account convertibility. From the latt er part of 1997, India moved to a cautious and well calibrated move towards capital acco unt convertibility. These developments tested the exchange rate regime which proved  conducive to growth while maintaining stability.23. India has been actively participating in the various in itiatives in SAARCFINANCE and ACU arrangements.  Exchange of views a nd co-ordination in policies through both formal and informal mechanisms ha ve been the main characteristics of co-operation. India\u2019s trade links with As ia are growing at an unprecedented scale.  The stated policy in regard to tari ffs is to bring them on par with those of East Asia as soon as feasible.  Policy on Free Trad e Agreements with countries in Asia, including SAPTA point to the bindin g forces of greater integration ofIndia into Asia. Launching of negotiations of Free Tr ade Agreements between ASEAN and India is of historic significance for carrying forward Asian Integration.24. As part of our policy of communication and to aid rese archers and analysts the Reserve Bank of India has been constructing a five-country an d 36-country indices for Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) and Real Effecti ve Exchange Rate (REER).We have decided to review the REER and accordingly we expe ct a new six-country index to replace the present five-country one. The new i ndex is likely to include the U.S.A., Eurozone, the U.K., Japan, China and Hong Kon g. The new index would in that case have two new currencies, both Asian, namely, the Renminbi and the Hong Kong Dollar. The 36-country index already includes the ke y Asian countries, but its review is likely to result in some enhancement of their we ights. This reflects an increasing recognition of the Indian economy\u2019s rapidly gro wing integration with Asia.-- ", "5 Oct 09 MP.pdf": "1  Emerging Market Concerns: An Indian Perspective1By Duvvuri Subbarao 1. From the perspective of Emergi ng Market Economies (EMEs) and particularly for that of India, I w ill highlight five concerns. These are: first, timing of exit from the a ccommodative monetary policy in the context of rising food price-led infla tion but still weak growth; second, the possibility of another surge in capital flow s, especially if we turn out to be an outlier in withdrawal of mone tary stimulus; third, monetary transmission mechanism as it is evolving from the crisis period; fourth, return to fiscal consolidation and qua lity of fiscal adjustment; and finally, the implications of the efforts towa rds financial stability on financial inclusion and growth.  Unique Features of the Indian Economy 2. Before I turn to these issues, I want  to indicate a few features unique to the Indian economy. These feat ures, I believe, are important to appreciate my comments on em erging market concerns.   3. What are the unique features of the Indian economy that distinguish it from other EMEs? First, our growth is driven by domestic demand \u2013 both                                                  Remarks by Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at G-30 International Banking Seminar in Istanbul on October 5, 2009 or ganized on the occasion of the IM F-World Bank Annual Meetings 2009.  2  consumption and investment. Consum ption and saving are well balanced. In India, the share of private fina l consumption expenditure in GDP is around 55 per cent. Our savings rate is 37.7 per cent and investment rate is 39.1 per cent.  4. Second, we have twin deficits \u2013 fiscal as well as current account deficit. We were on a path of fiscal consolidation before the crisis, but got off track because of the counter cy clical spending necessitated by the crisis.  Unlike major EMEs, which ar e running current account surpluses, we have recorded deficits on the current account. Although current account deficits have been modest, th e deficit reached a high of 2.6 per cent of GDP in 2008-09 but is expect ed to moderate during 2009-10.   5. Third, given the right balance between domestic consumption and saving on the one hand, and infrastructural bottlenecks in major areas (such as power, roads, urban infrastruct ure as also social infrastructure) on the other, India is essentially a supp ly-constrained economy. Just before the crisis, such supply concerns le d to a view that there might be overheating in the economy. Generally, weak external demand has led to some externally induced  cyclical slowdown. However, as the global economy recovers, supply constraints are again expected to be binding.  3  6. Against this backdrop of the unique features of our economy, let me turn to the five concerns that I want to raise.   First Concern: Exit from Accommoda tive Monetary Policy: Growth vs. Inflation   7. While there is broad agreement that  we need to exit from the present excessively accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, there is less agreement on when and how we should exit. There are incipient signs of recovery. Industrial production has picked up in the past couple of months, but export growth remains ne gative. Business confidence surveys suggest recovery from the troughs touched a year ago although the confidence levels remain below the earlier peaks.   8. Even as recovery remains weak, consumer price inflation (CPI) is running in double digits on the back  of high food prices. While the headline wholesale price inflation rema ins low (0.84 per cent for the week ended September 19, 2009) \u2013 it was even negative during June-August 2009 \u2013 CPI inflation has been persiste ntly high for almost a year. Higher food prices in our case are partly a re sult of the structural demand-supply imbalances. At present, cyclical fact ors are also at play. Monsoon in the current season, which ended on September 30, has been the weakest since 1972. Agricultural output is expected to suffer and this could keep upward 4  pressure on food prices in the co ming months. High food prices are, therefore, a mix of structural and cy clical factors. While the buffer stock of foodgrains and better supply mana gement could mitigate the adverse effects to an extent, imports ar e not an easy solution given the requirement.  9. Although inflation pressures emana ting from higher food prices may limit the scope for monetary policy action, there are implications for inflation expectations. Furtherm ore, unlike the major advanced economies, growth remains positive. R eal GDP growth was 6.7 per cent in 2008-09 and is expected to be 6.0 pe r cent (with an upward bias) as per the Reserve Bank\u2019s July 2009 projections . In view of the country specific features, we may need to exit fro m accommodative monetary policy earlier than advanced economies. This  calls for careful management of trade-offs: growth concerns warrant a delayed exi t, but inflation concerns call for an earlier exit. An early exit on inflation concerns runs the risk of derailing the fragile growth, while a delayed exit may e ngender inflation expectations.  Second Concern: Management of Large and Volatile Capital Flows  10. Major central banks \u2013 such as the US Fed, the ECB, the BoE \u2013 have flushed their financial systems w ith unprecedented amount of liquidity. 5  Till the first quarter of 2009, this liq uidity was finding its way back to the central banks as excess reserves  because of risk aversion.   11. Risk appetite is now returning. There are signs of recovery in portfolio investments to the EMEs. Fo r instance, portfolio investments by FIIs in the Indian equity market amounted to US$ 13.6 billion in the period April 1-September 18, 2009 as ag ainst outflows of US$ 5.2 billion in the corresponding period of 2008 refl ecting a turnaround of almost US$ 19 billion.   12. Moreover, as noted above, in view of  incipient inflationary pressures, policy rates in our case may have to  be tightened ahead of those in advanced economies. The resultant larg er interest differe ntial may attract larger capital inflows. Will capital infl ows be modest or turn into a flood as in 2007? The latter concern is particularly relevant in view of abundant liquidity in the major advanced econom ies. What will the implications be for exchange rates? In India, the current account is in modest deficit; hence large and volatile capital flow s can impose macroeconomic costs.  13. Emerging market central banks have three options in managing capital flows. The first option is for th e central bank not to intervene in the forex market and let the exchange rate  bear the burden of adjustment. Will undue exchange rate appreciation not further widen the current account 6  and what will the implications be for future sustainability? Will exchange rate appreciation help to  contain inflation? These are the questions to address if this option is adopted.   14. Second, the central bank can interven e in the forex market, but refrain from sterilisation. Such an approach r uns the risk of excessive growth in monetary and credit aggregates which can lead to higher inflation as well as credit and investment booms a nd create financial fragility.   15. The third option is to sterilise the interventions.  Irrespective of the method of sterilisation, th e financial cost of ster ilisation in terms of national balance sheet is obviously ultimately borne by the government even though direct costs may be borne  by separate agen cies. Sterilised intervention can exacerbate fiscal pressu res, but this needs to be assessed against the benefits of macro-financial stability.   Third Concern: De-clogging Mone tary Transmission Mechanism 16. Following the collapse of Lehman  Brothers, the global economic outlook deteriorated sharply, and th e Indian economy got impacted by the contagion through all the channels \u2013 the financial channel, the real channel and the confidence channel. The Reserve Bank\u2019s crisis response included, like in the case of other central banks, both conventional and unconventional measures.  7  17. In response to the easing of po licy interest ra tes and abundant liquidity made available, market rates eased significantly. Yields on 10-year central government securities fell from 8.6 per cent at end-September 2008 to 5.3 per cent by end-December 20 08. This trend has since reversed with yields hardening since the begi nning of the current calendar year on the back of large and abrupt incr ease in the government borrowing programme.  18. In contrast, interest rates on bank deposits and loans have exhibited stickiness. While the Reserve Bank cut the effective policy rate by 575 basis points, banks\u2019 Benchmark Prim e Lending Rates (BPLRs) have seen a reduction of only 100-275 basis point s. This stickiness has impeded monetary transmission and blunted the intended impact of policy actions. What is the explanation for the stickine ss in the interest rate structure of banks?  19. There are several factors that cause this stickiness \u2013 the higher rates of interest offered by the small savings instruments which discourage banks from reducing deposit rates, the high cost of deposits raised by banks during earlier tighter monetary policy regime which raised their weighted average costs, and the large government borrowing programme which pushed up yields on government securities. 8   20. These factors, which impeded moneta ry transmission, were in play even before the crisis. A definite ta sk going forward will be to address the impediments to monetary transmission.  Fourth Concern: Fiscal Stimulus - Withdrawal and Quality of Adjustment  21. Like in other economies, fiscal stimulus measures and weakening of economic activity have led to substantial increase in our fiscal deficits. The Central Government\u2019s fiscal defi cit is budgeted to jump from 2.7 per cent of GDP in 2007-08 to 6.8 per cent in 2009-10; the combined fiscal deficit of the Centre and the states is  expected to increase from 4.2 per cent of GDP to 10.2 per cent over the sa me period. These deficits are large and need to be rolled back. What is the scope for adjustment? What lesson does our past experience offer?  22. As a result of the discipline impos ed by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, the Centre\u2019s fiscal deficit came down from 6.2 per cent of GDP in 2001-02 to  2.7 per cent in 2007-08. Over the same period, the deficit of the stat e governments declined from 4.1 per cent of GDP to 1.5 per cent. Thus, we saw a large adjustment over a relatively small period. This past expe rience with fiscal adjustment may raise hopes that we will be able to roll back the recent fiscal deficits.  Such 9  a simplistic approach may be misleading.  A large part of our fiscal deficit is structural and not cyclical. Also, at  least a part of fiscal consolidation resulted from high growth, not the ot her way round. It is important to acknowledge this in order to define the problem and assess the enormity of the challenge.   23. Three issues are important in this context. First, this concept of \u2018fiscal adjustment over a cycle\u2019 is inadvisabl e for us. Adjustment over a cycle is for mature and advanced economies. Even there it does not work - the UK, for instance, was running its highest fiscal deficit at the peak of the economic cycle. We will be safest sticking to a single formula and tying ourselves down to annual, inflexible ta rgets. This is a blunt but safe way of de-linking fiscal adjustment from democratic pressures. Second, we must focus on the quality of fiscal ad justment, not just chase a numerical target. The ratio of capital outlay to  GDP for the Central Government has stagnated between 1 a nd 2 per cent of GDP since the early 1990s from around 2-3 per cent in the preceding deca de. Third, we cannot sit back and hope that tax increase will deliver fi scal consolidation on a platter. Revenue expenditure has increas ed from around 12 per cent of GDP during the period 2000-08 to over 15 per cent now. We need to work seriously on expenditure compression. This is going to be politically 10  challenging both at the Centre and in th e States, but it needs to be done regardless.   Fifth Concern: Financial Stability, Financial Inclusion and Growth    24. The last concern I want to raise re lates to the challenge of financial inclusion.   25. Given the enormity of the crisis, fi nancial sector regulation is being tightened under the aegis of international bodies such as the BCBS and FSB. There are proposals that would raise the reserve requirement of banks. New regulations for liquidity re quirements are also going to be in place. There are also proposals to require banks to hold government securities. Many of these measures  are necessary. But we need to recognise that all such proposals will have the impact of increasing the banks\u2019 funding costs which will transl ate into higher lending rates. How will banks react to such higher costs?  Will this lead to an erosion of banks\u2019 social responsibility towards th e poorer and other needy segments of the society? In economies such as India, a large part of population remains financially excluded. We will need to ensure that efforts at financial inclusion do not get negate d by the ongoing tightening of the regulatory regime.  11  26. In order to safeguard financial stability , we have traditionally used a variety of prudential measures such  as specifying exposure norms and pre-emptive tightening of risk weights and provisioning requirements. But these measures are not always costless. Fo r instance, tightening of risk weights arguably tempers the flow of credit to certain sectors, but excessive, premature or  unnecessary tightening could blunt growth. Similarly, exposure norms offer protection against concentration risks; however, such limits could re strict the availability of credit for important growth sectors. This is a live issue in our country in the context of the immense needs of infrastructure financing. Thus, as in the case of price stability, central banks face the challenge of managing the trade-off between financial stability and growth.  27. It needs to be recognized that af ter a crisis, with the benefit of hindsight, all conservative policies appear justified. But excessive conservatism in order to be prepared to ride out a potential crisis could thwart growth and financial innovati on. The question is what price are we willing to pay, in other word s, what potential benefits are we willing to give up, in order to prevent a black swan event? Experience shows that managing this challenge, that is to determine how much to tighten and when, is more a ques tion of good judgement rather than analytical skill. This j udgement skill is the one that central banks, 12  especially in developing countries such  as India, need to hone as they simultaneously pursue the objectives of growth and financial stability.   Conclusion  28. Thank you very much for giving me this platform to speak about the concerns of emerging economies as we  shift from managing the crisis to managing the recovery.  ---------- ", "16 Oct 09 MP.pdf": "Learning from Crises1 Ladies and Gentlemen,  The late John Kenneth Galbraith, Harvard Economics Professor Emeritus , attributed the longevity of his book The Great Crash 1929 \u2013 published in 1955 and never since out of print \u2013 to the tendency of history to threaten a repeat. \"Each time it has been about to pass from bookstores,\" he wrote in a later foreword, \"another speculative episode \u2013 another bubble or the ensuing misfortune \u2013 has stirred inte rest in the history of this, the great modern case of boom and collapse,  which led on to an unforgiving depression.\" So here we ar e again. The financ ial crisis that has engulfed credit markets over the recent per iod has pushed the old Keynesian economist's book back into the Amazon charts.   \"Bad distribution of income\" is the firs t of five weaknesses of the U.S. economy that Galbraith cites in his definitive work on the stock market collapse.  Though Galbraith says it was 5 percent, not 3 percent, of Americans who received one-third of per sonal income in 1929, he says this well-heeled group played a crucial role in the crash. \"The collapse in securities values affected in the first instance the wealthy and the well-to-do. But in the world of 1929 this was a vital group. The members disposed of a large proportion of the consumer income ; they were the source of the lion's share of personal savings and investment\"  History has an eerie way of repeating it self and memory of the pain of busts, according to Galbraith, is perhaps the best regulator  In the latest best seller The Ascent of Money , Niall Ferguson has also highlighted the fact that  the income of the median household in US has scarcely changed since 1980, increasing by just  7 per cent in the last 18 years                                                  Page 1 of 13  1  The 'Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF) Disti nguished Speaker Series' lecture delivered by Mrs. Usha Thorat Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at  Singapore on October 12, 2009.   while their borrowings multiplied severa l times and made what seemed a sub prime mortgage crisis to a full bl own global financial crisis.   In the current global crisis, no c ountry has been spared be it big or small, developing or develo ped, relatively insulated or more open. The shock has impacted both the financial and real sectors although it was financial sector led. In India, the impact th ough significant, has not been to the same extent as in other parts. Th is is partly attributed to the curbs India still has on the capital account, but mainly to t he dominance of domestic expenditure \u2013 consumption and investm ent \u2013 and high savings rate , leading to a balanced macro economy, having small current ac count deficits.  Nevertheless, the impact has been felt by the domestic cr edit equity and forex markets leading to slowing down in the growth rate  and employment gener ation. Still, the country is the second fastest growin g economy in the world with over 6 % growth projected for the current year.  The topic of my talk is \u201cLearning from crises\u201d. As Galbraith recalled it is amazing how the same mistakes get repe ated. Hence I think we owe it to the system to recollect and recount lessons from crises.  The key lessons are how to anticipate and take pre-emptive acti on and equally import ant, once you are in the middle of it, how to respond effectively viz. crisis management.  Post crisis, the critical issues are - how do we put in systems and buffers that can cushion the impact of economic cycl es and booms and busts that are so typical of market driven systems.   During the journey I have traversed in the RBI, I have been witness to many crisis situations of differing di mensions, especially since 1991. Delving into the past I feel veteran enough to  share these experiences and draw lessons.     The BOP crisis of 1991   This was a major crisis in the country. In mid 1991, the foreign exchange reserves of the country were  down to 11 days imports, even what Page 2 of 13  little reserves that remained were not  unencumbered. While the crisis was triggered by increase in oil prices and the Gulf war, the underlying factors were the macro imbalance in the fo rm of unmanageable current account and fiscal deficits. External de bt servicing as a proporti on of current receipts increased from 10.2 per cent in 1980-81 to 35.3 per cent of current receipts in 1990-91. The responses included curb ing imports through a system of administrative controls for large value le tters of credit, giving incentives for exports, pledging of gold reserves with Bank of England and Bank of Japan, devaluation of the Indian Ru pee, issuing attractive bonds in foreign currency to Non-Resident Indians, encouraging re turn flow of capital, an amnesty scheme through gold bonds, borrowing from mu ltilateral institutions, etc., and so on. The long term response included major reforms in  trade industry foreign investment  fiscal  and financia l sector paving the way for development of equity, forex money and government securities markets. There were fundamental changes in monetary management consequent upon stoppage of automatic monetisation of the government deficit and switch over to an auction based market borrowing for meeting the fiscal deficits.    Many valuable lessons were learnt from the crisis \u2013  \u0083 Exchange rates should not be overvalued for long periods \u0083 Providing exchange g uarantees by the centra l bank or government are best avoided  \u0083 On the external account , liberalis ing  equity flows first is a better option followed by commercial credit and longer term debt , while limiting the access to foreign debt by the financial sector  \u0083 Central bank funding of the gove rnment in the primary market should not  be resorted to \u0083 Excessively high remuneration on reserve requirements erodes monetary control. \u0083 Financial sector repression - excessi ve interest controls and credit rationing - is deleterious to growth.   \u0083 A strong financial sector requires prudential regulation and effective supervision   \u0083 Removing or reducing entry barriers to facilitate more competition  Page 3 of 13  \u0083 Coordinated action by the Gove rnment and the central bank with a well knit professional team worki ng together greatly facilitates the process   The Securities irregularities of 1992     The irregularities reflected specul ative buying in the stock market funded by bank liquidity through repurc hase transactions in government securities and bonds, facilitated by a nexus between broker s and banks. In part this reflected a way of earning higher yields in an otherwise administered interest rate structure. Such transactions were done against bank receipts where there were no underly ing government securities. The events that led to these irregularities could be attr ibuted to weaknesses and lack of transparency in the market infrastructu re for government se curities, excess liquidity with public sector undertakings, nexus between banks and brokers and inadequate internal controls that led to bank funds flowing to the stock markets fuelling abnormal stock price incr ease.  Poor internal controls were reflective of low levels of computeris ation and reliance on manual processing.  Consequences resulted when a settlem ent failure triggered panic and the irregularities surfaced in  the open.  RBI had to undertake a series of investigations to unravel the irregular transactions and fix responsibility.  A Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) cons tituted to investigate into these operations required enormous re sources of the management.    There were several positive fall outs of this crisis:   \u0083 Acceleration of capital market reforms and introduction of screen based order matching systems with commensurate depository custody clearing and settlement a rrangements that are continuously upgraded  \u0083 Institution of a delivery versus  payment mechanism for settlement of trades in government securities initially in RBI but later led to establishment of a central co unterparty in the form of CCIL (Clearing Corporation Of India ) which today undertakes guaranteed Page 4 of 13  settlement for government securities , repos in G Secs and forex market trades.  \u0083 Dissemination of information on all individual transactions in the government securities market on a daily basis and currently on real time basis  \u0083 Tightening of internal controls in investment transactions \u0083 Removal of administered interest rates \u2013currently only the savings bank deposit rate is fixed by the RBI, while all  other deposit rates are deregulated  \u0083 Strengthening supervision ov er banks and other financial institutions and establishment of the Board for Fina ncial Supervision (BFS) in 1994 with the primary obj ective of undertaking supervision of the financial sector comprising commercial banks, financial institutions and non-banking financial companies.   \u0083 Recognition of the possibility of  systemic risk in the absence of proper assessment of counterpar ty risk and well functioning securities markets with greater transparency \u0083 Focused attention on the role of the regulator which ensures adherence to regulations in letter and spirit and need for greater  accountability  Imbroglio caused by dealings of N on-Banking Financial Companies in 1997  Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) have been  historically subjected to a relatively lower degree of regulation vis-\u00e0-vis  the banks, the higher rates of return on deposits they could offer enabled them to attract a large base of small savers  and a potential threat to t he stability of the financial system. Added to these was the fact that operations of NBFCs were characterised by several distinctive features viz. no entry barriers, no requirement for large investment in fi xed assets and inventories, freedom to open branch offices, all of which led to  their proliferation in an unbridled manner. A few such companies which were perceived as well-functioning, well-managed and financially healthy and consequently had a large depositor Page 5 of 13  base, defaulted in repayment  of deposits, leading to the realisation that the extant framework was inadequate to m onitor and regulate these companies.  Though there were no systemic problems,  confidence of the depositors in the NBFCs as a sector was er oded and the Reserve Bank fa ced the risk of loss of reputation. In a specific instance, the in-principle approval given by the Reserve Bank to start a bank was used by the entity to mobilise huge funds from the unsuspecting public and the payable-at-par cheques issued by the entity on a leading commercial bank result ed in a huge exposure and default to the bank because of the lag between the timing of paym ents and providing funds cover.    The learning points were: \u0083 Recognition of the possibility of regulator y arbitrage between the entities regulated by banks and non banking financial companies and between the securiti es regulator and the bank regulator.  \u0083 Need for legal powers to regula te the activities of NBFCs, including framing of guidelines for compulsory registration, stringency in conditions for deposit-taking companies akin to banks, and applicability of prudential norms for such companies.     In the recent period, it has be en noted that, even if not accepting deposits, these companies can contribut e to systemic risk as they access public funds and participate in various  markets (debt, equity and foreign exchange markets). Hence capital ratios  and a quarterly system of reporting were introduced for large non-deposit taking NBFCs in 2007.    Asian Crisis of 1997 \u2013 the first global contagion  The South-East Asian crisis star ted with stock market and currency crashes followed by financial crisis whic h spilt over to the real sector. It changed irrevocably the way Asian countr ies look at issues of financial stability.. The Indian market was not  immune and even though there was a general belief that some correction in the rupee was required, the pressure on Page 6 of 13  the rupee in later part of t he year required RBI to inte rvene to maintain orderly conditions. Withdrawal of funds by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) hit the equity and foreign exchange markets and the sale of foreign exchange by RBI also affected the money and bond market s. In addition to intervention, monetary and administrative m easures had to be taken to stabilise markets. The impact on the domestic interest rate s and liquidity was the cost to be paid for restoring stability. The governm ent borrowing programme was managed through private placement and subsequent  open market operations when the markets stabilised.   The learning points were:   \u0083 Need for complementarity between macroeconomic stability and financial stability and exchange rate management for preserving competitiveness and confidence in the economy \u0083  Need for closer supervision and regulation of banks and other financial institutions \u0083 During asset price booms it is important to ensure that banks\u2019 exposure to capital markets and real  estate is not excessive and to understand that  banks can be s ubject to foreign exchange risk even without any currency mismatc hes in their books, when their constituents have huge unhedged exposures \u0083 Management of capital account is important for countries having chronic CAD and where inflation and interest rates are persistently over global levels.  \u0083 Dollarisation of the domestic mark et or internationalisation of the domestic currency can both require careful management.   \u0083 Financial stability emerged as a specific objective of policy as the cost of instability to the real sector is huge especially on the vulnerable segments of society.  Urban Co-operative Banks \u2013 the Weak Link  The tightening of regulation over the banking and NBFC sectors saw the gravitation of risk to the light ly regulated Urban Co -operative Banks Page 7 of 13  (UCBs) which were under  dual regulation of the RBI and the registrar of cooperative societies. The stock market  crash in 2002 triggered a payments problem and it was found that the nexus between the broker and a large UCB (Madhavpura Mercantile Co-operative  Bank) led to huge exposure to the broker and the bank colla psed.  The systemic impl ication was that hundreds of small UCBs had exposur e to this bank and the collapse of these banks would have been very disruptive though confined to a small region. The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) had to make a large payout to the collapsed bank under  a restructuring package and averted the domino effect. But the Madhavpura Bank collapse led to erosion in public confidence and there were a series of  UCB failures across the country. The immediate measures taken were to  ban connected lending, exposure to share-brokers and inter-UCB deposits.  The supervisory system \u2013 both on-site and off-site \u2013 was triggered and strengt hened.  In 2004, all new branch and bank expansion was stopped and a vision  document was put out in 2005 which provided for a MoU wit h the state governments to work out a way for non-disruptive exit of weak UCBs wh ile simultaneously incentivising the growth of strong banks. Subsequently various resolution options have been provided such as merger wit h or without support from DICGC, restructuring of liabilities, introduction of new capital-lik e instruments, and transfer of assets and liabilities. The UCB sector has seen a reduction in the number of weak banks from 725 to 496. 102 banks have gone out of the system through mergers and liquidation. DICGC has al so strengthened it s claim payments system to ensure that prompt relief is  given to small depositors of failed banks.   The lessons learnt were:  \u0083 In dealing with a crisis arising ou t of interconnectedness, breathing time needs to be provided through liquidity injection. \u0083 Reduce interconnectedness within the financial system as it leads to a 'moral hazard' problem of  'too interconnected to fail' \u0083 The most lightly regulated entit y in the financial system becomes the weakest link. The  system's weak est link becomes a  source of reputation risk and erosion in public confidence Page 8 of 13  \u0083 Even though under dual regulation, the bank regulator has to use its powers more effectively and take steps to resolve weak banks.   Failure of a fairly significant mid sized commercial bank in 2004  The Global Trust Bank Ltd, a private sector bank had reported substantial growth and was growing too fast. The bank\u2019s balance sheet was flawed and disclosures inadequate. Very large capital market exposures and shortfall in provisioning were the causes for downfall of the bank. The common depositor does not have the w herewithal to study bank balance sheets before making a deposit, but even the institutional investors seem to be gullible investors. It was also realised that even though insolvent, a bank can carry on without a run as long as it has adequate liquidity or access to liquidity. Interestingly, even at the time of moratorium, the bank had huge inter-bank borrowings and deposits reflecting the confidence placed by other banks and institutional invest ors or the moral hazard view that banks will not be allowed to fail.  Auditor accountabili ty came under focus. The problem had to be dealt with heads on when all avenues and options for revival by the promoters and directors fail ed. Compulsory amalgamation with a public sector bank was resorted to.   This experience gave us valuable less ons of how to deal with a bank run.   \u0083 The process of resolution should be swift and decisive and preferably over the weekend  \u0083 In a computerised system with 24/ 7 banking, and large retail base, the preparation for a moratorium has  to be much more meticulous than in traditional banking. \u0083 Role of media is critical and in any crisis management media management has to be given priority. We actually had to go on media to give out reassurances  about the bank to stop the run \u0083 Adequate liquidity and currency needs  to be kept ready to stem a run once the resolution strategy is decided Page 9 of 13  \u0083 A moratorium is useful to give breathing time to put a resolution package in place but hardship r equests can become tedious to handle.    Institutional factors   This decade has been one of challenges in managing capital flows both inflows and outflows. Both monetar y policies and prudent ial policies have been used through a variety of instruments to manage the macro economic and financial stability challenges  arising out of large c apital flows, external shocks such as 9/11, political uncerta inty, geo political events, and have called for vigilance and prompt actions. While evolving policy instruments to manage these conditions such as the Market Stabilisation Scheme for sterilising the impact of infl ows are important I would lik e to flag a few critical institutional factors which I think ar e required to be encouraged and made part of the automatic trigger mechanisms in  the system. I would like to turn to these -  Problem Recognition  \u2013 The meaning of being vigi lant is to be able to constantly scan the horizon and recognise that a problem is brewing and take pre-emptive action before the problem becomes disruptive. The indicators could be asset values, excess credi t growth, large unhedged exposures, continuing current account deficits financed by short term credit, weakly regulated entities in the system, opportunities for r egulatory arbitrage, large leveraged positions,  prolonge d periods of liquidity excesses or shortages; or the tendencies of entities to leverage, especially by exploiting the inter-linkages in the financial system .  Committee Approach  \u2013 As part of crisis management, it is necessary to have a harmonised approach. First it is  essential to have close coordination with the Government. As in 1991, this  was an important requirement in responding to the recent crisis. Putting in place an institutional mechanism and systems that can facilitate conti nuous dialogue and co-ordination between those in charge of monetary policy, debt management, foreign Page 10 of 13  exchange management, regulat ion and supervision of banking entities, supervision of non-banking entities, secu rities markets regulation and the like is a sine-qua-non.  Within each of these segments it is crucial to be in sync.  We have a Financial Markets Committee (F MC) in the central bank consisting of senior executives responsible for monetary policy and operations, debt management and foreign exchange rese rves management. The FMC meets at least once every day in the mo rning and emergent meetings are also convened when there are episodes of shar p volatility in equity markets, or when any of the other markets are signi ficantly affected. Other regulatory departments including the dep artment responsible fo r payment system also get involved during such times. The Committee keeps in touch with the securities regulator (SEBI), the stock exchanges especially the clearing and settlement corporation of  the exchanges, the Clearin g Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL) and t he like.  We also have a Cr isis Management Group that meets whenever a crisis is anticipated or occurs.   Inter-regulatory Co-ordination \u2013 Financial sector harmonisation among the securities, insurance, pens ion fund and bank regulators is enabled through the High Level Co-ordinatio n Committee on Financial Markets (HLCCFM). The HLCCFM is headed by t he Governor, RBI and meets as and when felt required. The Ministry of Finance provides the secretariat.  Sub-committees / groups formed among SEBI, IRDA, PFRDA and RBI, meet to discuss and sort out issues relating to  developments in the financial markets having implications cutting across different regulators.  Institutionalised and formal approach to decision making in a cr isis has the benefit of building on the experience of the members.   Consultative Approach  \u2013 we have also reaped the advantages of using external experts in our policy making. We have a Technical Advisory Committee for Monetary Policy consisting of academicians, practitioners and experts, which tenders advice to RBI on monetary policy stance. There is also a Technical Advisory Committee that consis ts of financial sector experts from areas such as banking, academics, government, stock exchanges, credit rating agencies and market  representatives. This committee  meets once a Page 11 of 13  quarter to deliberate on developments in money, foreign exchange and government-securities markets and offe rs advice on policies for regulation, growth and further reforms in financial markets, including products, practices and institutional arrangements.   Capacity Building \u2013 Equally crucial is the need to develop people and systems to deal with scenarios and contingencies, which can be achieved only through a sustained process of capacity building. Giving exposure through participation in meetings at loca l and international levels, allowing officers even at fairly junior levels to  be part of the dialogue process at the top levels in various co-ordination fora, enormously helps in nurturing talent. A consultative and participative approach to decision making through setting-up of working groups consisting of a mix of internal and external people with clearly set tasks and time-lines not only casts responsibility but also aids developing expertise. Emphasis in these groups is on harnessing collective wisdom and balanced judgement, typical of a college-like atmosphere for decision making.   Robust Infrastructure \u2013 I am referring to the development of sound market infrastructure for payments and se ttlement for all financial transactions as also market infrastructure for trading reporting information dissemination and clearing settlement. CCPs for clear ing and settlement of equity government securities forex and money markets are in place following the best practices laid down by IOSCO/CPS S. The infrastructure for electronic payments and RTGS are now taken for granted.   Summing up   A lot has been talked about  the current crisis and the response. Most of these talks are on the website. I would ju st like to say that the major learning from this crisis is that globalization has meant that no country is immune from the happenings in global financial markets. Also, at one level, the presence of complex and interconnected financial entities across several jurisdictions with regulators at the nat ional level has pos ed huge challenges in ensuring that there is no regulatory arbitrage and that there is coordination amongst Page 12 of 13  regulators. Even within a juri sdiction, it is recognized that all regulators have to deal with systemic risk and there is need for inter regulatory dialogue and vigilance.    At the macro level, Asian countries  and Latin American countries have learnt lessons from their own past cu rrency and financial crises and have built up reserves and have strengthened their financial systems apart from consciously developing their financial ma rkets. But they have been careful to ensure that their banks are not involved  excessively in toxic assets or innovative transactions. Even so, t he countries have had to face the consequences of falling global tr ade and GDP and unemployment and slowing credit growth. Macro economic imbalances continue though they have reduced. Savings is increasing in the western world and consumption increasing in the East.    Ultimately, we all have to be c oncerned about the real sector and recognize that financial sector developm ent is not a goal by  itself but is intended to enable the growth, not just of the rich, but more importantly inclusive growth cutting across all segments of the society and regions. As regulators and central banks, it is our duty to ensure this.   .

I would like to convey my appreciations to the College of Supervisors  (CoS)  for organising this conference. I also congratulate the CoS for its accomplishments over the last two years.   2. In the context of the overall impact of the C OVID -19 pandemic,  the war in Ukraine and the recent banking sector events in the US and Europe on the financial sector, there is now renewed focus on issues of financial resilience and stability.  Regulators and Governments across the world are now looking at these aspects with greater intensity. Adequacy of the existing regulations and supervisory systems are under fresh assessment.  In this background, a global conference on financial resilience is very appropriate and timely.    3. The financial sector in a country and the ind ividual entities therein like banks, non- banking financial companies (NBFCs) and other entities have to be resilient at all times. They should have the inner strength to withstand even the most stressful times. So far as India is concerned, the Reserve Bank of India has significantly strengthened its regulations and supervision of banks and other regulated entities in 2  recent years.  Our approach has been to enhance the resilience as well as the robustness of the f inancial sector so that individual entities effectively withstand stressful situations and continue to contribute to the process of economic development of the country.  In my address today, I propose to highlight the expectation s of the Reserve Bank of India from the stakeholders in the Indian financial system.  1.  4. In most economies, central banks act as custodians of financial stability . Central banks  are also empowered to act as a lender of last resort  during  financial crises. This historical function of providing emergency  liquidity assistance to banks and other financial market institutions  necessitates that c entral banks  keep a close watch  on banks and financial markets for signs of instability , if any. Moreover, monetary policy is implemented largely t hrough banks and financial markets. The transmission of monetary policy to the real economy depends crucially on the smooth functioning of the financial markets as well as financial intermediaries like banks  and NBFCs . It is in this context that the key and complementary functions of central banks such as setting of interest rates,  liquidity management, regulat ion and supervision over the banking and other segments of the financial sector become more pronounced. These functions work together to support economic growth by maintaining financial stability and promoting responsible behaviour among financial institutions .   5. Let me now specifically turn to the concept of \u2018resilience \u2019 which is the theme of today\u2019s conference. Systemic resilience depends both on the resilience of individual financial institutions  as well as on the interdependencies among them .  3   6. A resilient future ready bank needs to be financially , operationally and organisationally resilient . To be financially resilient, a bank should have adequate capital buffers and be able to generate earnings even in times of severe macroeconomic shocks. It should also have adequate liquidity to meet its obligations in various situations . Therefore, f inancial resilience is closely linked to a bank \u2019s business model and strategy. The Reserve Bank has, therefore, started looking at the business models of banks more closely. Aspects or  deficiencies  in the business model itself can s park a crisis in due course. We have not only prescribed regulatory  norms for capital adequacy and liquidity ratios, but even gone beyond  to nudge banks to build up capital buffers in good times and times of plenty. We did this during the COVID -19 pandemic  when there was plenty of liquidity, the interest rates were low and the full impact of the pandemic on the financial sector was still highly uncertain.   7. The Reserve Bank has also put in place various prudential regulatory framework s. These  include  capital adequacy requirements, asset classification and provisioning requirements, dividend distribution framework  and liquidity management framework . In addition, the Reserve Bank also periodically deploys macroprudential measures to address system level  build -up of risks . As a consequence of the measures taken by both the Reserve Bank and the banks  themselves , the Indian banking system has remained resilient and has not been affected adversely  by the recent sparks of financial instability seen in some advanced economies. This also comes out clearly in our recent stress test results.  4  8. The Gross NPA ratio for the S cheduled Commercial Banks  (SCBs)  was 4.41 per cent  at end December 2022, down from 5.8 per cent as on March 31, 2022 and 7.3 per cent  as on March 31, 2021. The CRAR at 16. 1 per cent  at end December 2022 is also much above the  minimum regulatory requirement. Macro stress tests for credit risk indicate that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimu m capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios.    9. Nevertheless, the recent events in the banking landscape of the US and Europe suggest that risks for an individual bank could crop up from segments of its balance sheet which might have been considered relatively safer. Hence, we expect the management and Board of Directors of each bank to  continually  assess the financial risks and focus on building up adequate capital and liquidity buffers even beyond the regulatory minimum for continu ed resilience and sustainable growth.    10. Let me now focus on operational  resilien ce. This would  mean that a bank should be able to deliver critical services even in the face of disruptions. Cyber risks and possible cyber -attacks are on top of the list so far as such disruptions are concerned.   11. Cyber risk has been identified as the foremost in top ten operational risks for 2023 based on a global survey1 of financial institutions. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), while revising the Principles for Sound Management of Operational Risk in 2021,                                                             1 Source: Risk.Net  5  introduced a specific principle on \u2018Information and Communications Technology (ICT) risk management \u2019 reflecting the importance of this risk. Robust IT and information security governance would  help in increased predictability and reduction of uncertainty in operations, minimise losses from information security related incidents  and enhance operational resi lience. Given the extensive level of outsourcing being done by the banks  and also by other regulated entities , there is even greater need for ensuring that effective policies and practices are in place in this regard. Even the G20 finance ministers and cen tral bank governors are focusing on risks arising from third party dependencies. The RBI has taken a slew of measures in the recent years with usage of advanced analytical  and surveillance tools along with techniques like p hishing simulation and cyber reconnaissance exercises to push for enhanced IT and cyber security governance process es in banks and other  supervised entities. In the context of the growing exposure of Regulated Entities  (REs)  to various risks from dependen cy on third-parties  which provi de technology and IT -enabled services , the R eserve Bank  has recently on April 10, 2023 issued comprehensive guidelines on Information Technology outsourcing2 by banks , NBFCs, and other REs.   12. The third component of resilience for banks  and other financial institutions  is to be organisationally resilient so that they  anticipate risks early  and absorb them efficiently. Organisations must have the capacity and resilience to protect themselves from adverse incidents and shield their balance  sheets . To achieve organisational resilience,  REs need to                                                             2 Master Direction on Outsourcing of Information Technology Services 6  continuously evolve by standardising policies, processes , organisational culture and governance. They must also be flexible enough to encourage diverse ideas and innovations within the organisation.   Pillars of Reserve Bank\u2019s Regulatory and Supervisory Strategy  13. An important element in our strategy of making the Indian financial system , including the banking system,  future ready is the robust and enhanced regulatory and s upervisory framework we have put in place in the last few  years. Our present approach to regulation and s upervision has been built essentially on three pillars .   14. First, one of our focus areas in recent years has been to strengthen governance and assurance functions within the Regulated Entities . The safety and soundness of the banking system relies critically on effective governance, so that the interest of all stakeholders , especially  the depositors , are safeguarded. The essence of good governance is to build an environment of trust, transparency and accountability . Depositors , whose money represent s an overwhelming part of  banks\u2019 resources, keep their life savings and hard-earned money with the banks.  Protection of depositors\u2019  money is , therefore, a sacred duty which has to be fulfilled through good governance.  There cannot  be any compromise on this. T he Reserve Bank is very particular that the Regulated Entities have systems and processes that promote sound corporate governance. The assurance functions i.e. risk management, compliance and internal audit s in banks are critical links between governance and business. Assurance functions assist the Board as well as the senior management in gau ging 7  whether the business operations of the bank or NBFC are being run in conformity with the policies and strategies laid down by the Board. The Reserve Bank  has issued detailed guidelines for ensuring quality and independence of the governance and assura nce functions. These areas are also subjected to intensive supervisory assessment.   15. Second, we have devoted our efforts to identifying and addressing the root causes of the vulnerabilities. Many a time s, vulnerabilities arise from inappropriate business model s adopted by banks and other financial entities. Over -aggressive growth strategies  or mindless pursuit of bottomlines , for instance, are often a precursor to future problems. While we do not interfere with business decision making, Regulated Entities  must demonstrate adequacy of internal controls and loss absorption capacity to match the risks that their business models may generate. Our approach is to flag deficiencies in this area to the senior management or to the Board of Directors of individual in stitutions for remedial action. We also remain engaged with external auditors and flag issues that are relevant for their role as the third line of defence.  In recent times, our focus on \u2018 root cause\u2019  has led us to mandate certain housekeeping hygiene such as automated identification of non- performing loans and provisioning, proper checks and balances in the use of Internal  and Office accounts, implementation of Early Warning Systems (EWS)  for preventi ng frauds and a host of IT and cybersecurity related controls, among others.   16. Third, within the Reserve Bank, we have considerably strengthened our supervisory analytics. We are increasingly employing data analytics \u2013 both macro and micro \u2013 to capture potential and 8  emerging risks, identify outlier entities and the vulnerable large exposures of banks. Our onsite supervisors deep dive into areas red -flagged by offsite supervision  teams. We are now focusing on the adoption of advanced analytical based technological solutions, including Artificial Intelligence/M achine Learning  (AI and ML), for strengthening the internal supervisory processes.   17. We have a system of early warning signals that provide lead indication s of risk build -up. Stress tests are also carried out on a continuous basis. These stress tests not only cover individual entities but also capture the system level stress.    18. While asset quality and capital position indicate resilience and robustness of financial institutions in the medium term, liquidity is often seen as the immediate cause of crisis. We monitor liquidity position of our entities very closely and aberrations , if any, are immediately taken up with the supervised entities for remedial measures. Thus, our whole approach to Supervision has been pro-active for minimi sing surprises, spotting concerns and addressing vulnerabilities early.   19. In essence, the unification  of supervisory architecture  within the Reserve Bank (i.e, combining the supervisory processes of commercial banks, NBFCs and urban cooperative banks  (UCBs) into an integrated Department of Supervision ); ownership -agnostic  and risk -focused supervision ; a shift from episodic to continuous supervision ; enhanc ed off-site surveillance leveraging on data analytics and SupTech solutions ; strengthened on -site supervision; root cause analysis of problems  and identification of outlier entities ; and deep- dive into 9  vulnerable areas  have been the major planks  of our supervisory strategy.    20. The R eserve Bank  has also taken several regulatory initiatives in recent years to strengthen governance, risk management, audit and compliance functions in NBFCs and UCBs. These include the new scale based regulatory framework for NBFCs issued in October 2021 and the revised regulatory framework for UCBs issued in July 2022. Even before these new regulatory frameworks were brought in, we had taken  measures such as issu ance of  guidelines on appointment of Chief Risk Officers (CROs) and Chief Compliance Officers(CCOs) in large NBFCs; Liquidity coverage ratios for NBFCs with asset size of \u20b95000 crore  and above; risk -based internal audit (RBIA) norms for large NBFCs (with asset size of \u20b95000 crore and above) and UCBs with asset size of \u20b9500 crore and above;  and harmonising the guidelines on appointment of statutory auditors for NBFCs  and UCBs with that of commercial banks.    Importance of Effective Internal and External Audit s 21. I would now like to touch upon the criticality of effective internal and external audits for financial institutions. It is no secret that stability and growth of an economy and financial markets are dependent upon trust among stakeholders.  To be future rea dy, banks and financial institutions need to earn the trust of their current as well as prospective customers.  One cannot take the \u2018 trust\u2019 for granted. With greater openness of the economy and faster transmission of information and capital flows on account  of advent of technology, it has become even more necessary to ensure credibility and confidence in the system.  10  Towards this cause, a robust assurance mechanism by way of internal audit is essential to provide independent evaluation and assurance to the stakeholders that the operations of a Regulated Entity are being performed in accordance with the prescribed policies and procedures. Statutory auditors  also play a vital role in maintaining market confidence on audited financial statements. In bank ing industry, this public role is particularly relevant for financial stability, given that banks hold public deposits. Audit quality is key to the effectiveness of such public role.  For these reasons, the Reserve Bank as the supervisor has a keen interest  in the functioning of statutory auditors of  the Regulated Entities.  Wherever necessary, we engage with the external statutory auditors on issues of critical nature in individual banks and financial entities.   22. We have recently revised the guidelines for statutory branch audits of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) according to which a minimum of 70% of credit exposure of a bank is required to be covered. From FY 2023 -24 onwards, the Board of Directors of PSBs will decid e on the coverage of branch audit and selection of branches. While doing so, the Boards are required to keep in mind the specific  characteristics  of individual banks like the bank\u2019s business and  risk profile, geographical spread, degree  of centralisation of processes , etc . We expect the Boards of banks to exercise the highest level of diligence while deciding on these issues. As regards  statutory branch audit  of Private Sector Banks  (PVBs) , we are doing a fresh assessment of the quality and coverage of such audits.  Skill and capacity building  in the Reserve Bank  23. In the Reserve Bank  we attach a lot of importance to skill building and capacity development of our employees. We have been 11  strengthening the Department of Supervision both in number and quality. This is important as effective supervision requires specialised skills and mature judgement. In this context, we expect the College of Supervisors to keep on improving its training methodologies, adopt more case study -based teaching, have more practical sessions  in its training programmes , and develop objective assessment of the impact of its training interventions. The feedback received from trainees may be used to improve programme  content and fill the  gaps identified. The training programme s may also strike a balance between teaching hard technical skills and promoting  soft skills such as leadership, decision making, time management and conflict resolution.    24. The rapid developments and innovations in the financial system, especially in the areas of fintech and digital products pose new opportunities as well as risks. These may affect financial intermediation, payment systems, cyber security and consumer protection. We have to continue  monitor ing and assess ing the implications of these emerging trends, while also developing our own capabilities and frameworks to effectively respond to these challenges .  25. In recent times, we have seen a proliferation of digital lending by NBFCs, FinTechs and loan apps. Such lending also brought with it certain challenges, especially with regard to fair practices and consumer protection. To address these challenges, the R eserve Bank  has laid down comprehensive guidelines for digital lending in September 2022 . These guidelines aim to ensure that lending activities are conducted by the REs and their partners such as Loan Service 12  Providers (LSPs) in a prudent, fair, transparent and responsible manner.   Conclusion  26. To sum up, the Reserve Bank remains committed to future -proof ing the Indian financial system and provide the required support for sustainable growth. I am confident that this G lobal Conference on Financial Resilience organised by the College of Supervisors with participation of experts from India and abroad will add considerable value to the body of knowledge in the area of resilient financial systems. I have been informed that many research papers on identif ied themes have been received and select papers have been made part of the maiden issue of the Journal of Financial Resilience, which was  released today . I am sure the deliberations during the Conference would provide a lot of food for thought and bring new perspectives on the evolution of financial regulation and supervision.   I wish the conference a ll success !  Thank you.  ", "17 Apr 11 FM.pdf": "   Statement by Mr. Duvvuri Subbarao, G overnor, Reserve Bank of India  (On behalf of Mr. Pranab Mukherjee,  Finance Minister of India and Member IMFC representing the Constituency cons isting of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Sri Lanka)  Leader of the Indian Delegation to the International Monetary and Financial Committee Washington D.C., April 16, 2011  Mr. Chairman, 1. There have been significant developm ents in the global economy since we met in the fall of 2010. The IMF too has m oved on several fronts under its mandate which has strengthened its position in a changing world. There are several key questions confronting us today: Is the rec overy assured in the face of still turbulent financial conditions and upward pressures on commodity prices? How resilient is the international monetary system to future shocks? Will the ongoing reforms empower the IMF and make it more effec tive in anchoring global monetary and financial stability?   The Global Economy and Financial Markets 2. A variety of risks, including political and social turmoil in parts of the world combined with natural disasters, have made the global recovery vulnerable .  Financial conditions have turned volatile  and uncertain, with risks of adverse feedback loops into the global economy. Recurring sove reign debt fears have affected market confidence. In the crisis-affected econom ies, financial systems are yet to be fully repaired. While the sense of crisis has waned, new challenges have surfaced.   3. The global recovery may be jeopardized  by a sustained rise in oil prices. Apart from the inflationary pressures c onfronting particularly the emerging and developing countries, there is the da nger of a slowdown in the global economy unless oil prices moderate from current levels. Furthermore, since the summer of 2010, several natural calamities and conse quent food supply constraints have collided with the post-cris is resurgence of demand. World food prices have surged considerably due to concerns about low fu ture supplies because of bad weather and low inventories, raising concerns about food security. Speculative movements in commodity derivative markets are al so causing volatility in prices. Global Challenges and the Role of the IMF 4. The overarching problems confronting the international monetary system stem from weaknesses in detecting and communicating early warnings of impending crises and management of globa l liquidity. This calls for fundamental reform of the international monetary syst em. It is also important to evolve a mechanism to address the challenges of  stemming volatile capital flows and to strengthen multilateral adjustment mechanisms  to deal with imbalances and sources of instability.  IMF Surveillance   5. The surveillance function is critical to the IMF\u2019s overall mandate. By focusing on vulnerabilities a nd detecting the onset of cr ises, it assumes a vital, preemptive role in preserving global and national stability. Effective implementation at both multilateral and bilateral levels is the key to providing  2surveillance with incisiveness and traction. We believe that this can be achieved within the ambit of the existing provisions of the Articles of Agreement. If, however, there is a consensus that there ar e gaps in the legal mandate that hinder effective implementation, an amendment to the Articles is the optimal approach. Ensuring consistency and comprehensiven ess across the various levels of surveillance is important, as is the candour and evenhandedness of the IMF - that systemic risks are pointed out irrespective of where they may originate. We need to stress that multilateral surveillance by the IMF should not lose sight of sovereign debt concerns of developed countries by  adopting tighter scre ening criteria for developing countries that have actually s een fiscal improvement relative to the advanced economies.  Managing Capital Flows         6. As the recovery of emerging and developing countries has gained momentum, capital flows have surged back to near pre-crisis levels. These flows have exhibited considerable volatility, im parting macroeconomic instability in the event of sudden stops and reversals, er oding competitiveness and complicating the setting of macroeconomic policies.  Policy  prescriptions with respect to capital flows should be even-handed.  So far as lumpy and volatile flows are a spillover from policy choices of advanced economi es, managing capital flows should not be treated as an exclusive problem of emer ging market economies and the burden of adjustment should be shared. How this burden will be shared raises both intellectual and practical challenges.   37. As regards multilateral strategies to mana ging capital flows, it is difficult to follow an approach that seeks to establis h, standardize, priori tize or restrict the range of policy responses of the member c ountries that are faci ng large surges in volatile capital inflows. Based on thei r experience, policymakers must have flexibility and discretion to adopt policies that they consider appropriate to mitigate risks through macroeconomic,  prudential and capital ac count management policies without a sense of stigma attached to particular instruments. Given the state of knowledge on these issues, it will be premat ure to consider amending the Articles to either give the IMF jurisdiction over capital account po licies of member countries or to impose an obligation on members on this count. The IMF\u2019s Resources 8. We welcome the ratification of the Ap ril 2008 quota reforms. The next step in this process should be the speedy ra tification and implementation of the 2010 quota and governance reforms. A compre hensive review of the quota formula should be completed by January 2013 to set the stage for the 15th General Review of Quotas by January 2014 which will carry  forward the modest progress made so far in enhancing the representation of dynamic emerging and developing countries in the IMF to meaningfully reflect the changing global economic realities. We must make our best efforts to complete the 2010 reform before the 2012 Annual Meetings.    49. We welcome the expanded and amended New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) which became effective from Ma rch 11, 2011. The activation of the NAB should be regarded as a bridge between curre nt expectations and the availability of higher quota resources unde r the 14th General Review. Subsequently, NAB should be scaled down so as to preserve the quota-based character of the IMF as an institution that is accountab le to its membership.  Reserve Adequacy 10. In our  view, the insurance that re serves provide against sudden stops in growth due to capital dr ying up far outweigh the opportunity costs. Reserve accumulation by countries is an important part of the global safety net, particularly when the reserve accumulation takes pl ace in the context of current account deficits. 11. Any assessment of reserve adequacy  needs to be informed by underlying country-specific condit ions, rigorous analytical a nd empirical f oundations and judgments based on practical experience. There should be due consideration to macroeconomic and prudential frameworks and policies, as we ll as alternative forms of contingent financi ng, country insurance, and over all assets and liabilities that may not be  easily captured in any formula for re serve adequacy. For emerging economies facing volatile surges of capital flows, consideration needs to go even beyond to a broad range of scenarios rela ting to potential drains on reserves, including a sudden stop of new financing, withdrawal of foreign portfolio investments, capital flight, and current acc ount vulnerabilities. Further, the question  5of reserve adequacy cannot be resolved without addressing the broader issue of scarcity of safe reserve assets.  Currency Internationalizati on and the Role of the SDR 12. In principle, it is desirable to develop a multi-currency system with several currencies operating as broad substitutes  and reflecting changing economic weights and global realities. In this context, we note that there have been recent efforts by the IMF to promote the use of SDR as a potential reserve asset for the evolving international monetary system. For the SDR to take on this significant role, several prerequisites have to be in place.  The SDR has to be accepted as a liability of the IMF, has to be automatically acceptable as a medium of payment in cross-border transactions, be freely tradeable and its price has to be determined by forces of demand and supply. As the SDR does not satisfy these conditions, it cannot be a reserve currency in the international payment system. In principle, one needs a global central bank to issue SDRs which take the characteristic of unit of global payment and settlement system. Thus, we see the move to multicurrency world as a gradual evolution. Another dimension of this  issue is to change the composition of the SDR basket. Going by the recent initiatives,  if at all there is a move to alter the composition of the SDR basket, we could consider including currencies of those dynamically emerging market economies that satisfy the existing inclusion criteria: in particular, a fully convertible capital account and a market determined exchange rate.   6Developments in the Constituency 13. I now turn to developments in my constituency. Bangladesh 14. Bangladesh is steadily moving towards a higher growth trajectory that is largely inclusive, environment-friendl y and well supported by continued high performance in the agriculture sector. Exte rnal sector viability has benefited from export growth estimated at 30 percent and the strength of inward remittances. Concerted efforts to address the shortage  of power have improved the investment climate. However, inflation remains high, w ith pressures from global prices of fuel, food and fertilizers interacting with enhanced internal demand. Revenue mobilization has risen by 28 percent till  February 2011 strengthening fiscal sustainability. The budget defi cit is expected to remain  below 4.5 percent of GDP thereby aiding overall macroeconomic st ability. As import demand picks up on the back of domestic demand, some strains co uld build on the balance of payments, although the level of foreign ex change reserves would remain sufficient at the level of over four months of im ports. Accordingly, monetary policy is being tightened with the exchange rate being allowed to  depreciate and cushion the balance of payments. Over the medium term, the progressive removal of constraints on investment, domestic and fore ign, particularly in the c ontext of private and public sector partnerships in large infrastructu re projects would enable Bangladesh to embark upon double digit gr owth with stability.    7Bhutan 15. Bhutan\u2019s growth momentum has been  strong, underpinned by the prudent and skillful macroeconomic management.  Real GDP growth accelerated to nearly 8 per cent in 2009-10, helped by robust gr owth in hydropower, construction and services sectors.  However, inflation reached 9 per cent at end-2010.  The current account deficit has increased to about 13 pe r cent of GDP due to strong imports in the hydropower sector, but the overall balance of payments has remained in surplus due to sizeable grants and loans disbursements.  The reserve position has improved and remains comfortable.  Credit has grow n rapidly, mainly driven by housing and construction sectors as well as personal loan s.  Bhutan\u2019s financial sector coped with the global financial crisis well and financial stability indicators are comfortable. India 16. The Indian economy, on the back of  improved agricultu ral output, strong private consumption, robust investment, and a pick-up in exports, has rebounded strongly with a GDP growth of 8.6 per cent in 2010-11. However, inflation has emerged as a major concern. Headline infl ation has remained firm despite some moderation in food inflation as generali sed price pressures have emerged with rising inputs costs feeding into manufactur ed products inflation. The hardening of global commodity prices, particularly oil prices have further accelerated inflation. A sequenced withdrawal of monetary accommodation is helping to contain inflationary pressures and anchor inflat ionary expectations which remained at elevated levels for a large part of 2010-11, largely driven by fuel and food prices.  8The calibrated fiscal consolidation th at resumed in 2010-11 is being carried forward into the medium-term, thus alleviating some pressures on aggregate demand. The budgetary initiatives in 2011-12 indicate further progress towards it, while giving due importance to the objectiv es of removing struct ural constraints, promoting infrastructure investment and strengthening the earlier policy initiatives towards inclusive growth. However, a potential increase in the subsidies on petroleum products and fertilizers as a resu lt of high crude prices could put pressure on expenditure. Managing capital flows so as to dampen potential threats to macroeconomic and financial stability is  a continuous challenge. Despite some tightness in money markets, financial condi tions have been orderly with a pick-up in credit growth, vibrant equity market  activity and a stable foreign exchange market. Medium-term prospects continue to be positive. Downside risks emanate mainly from continuing uncertainty about energy and commodity prices which may vitiate the investment climate, posing a threat to the current growth trajectory. Notwithstanding the risks, the Indian ec onomy is poised to sustain the growth momentum.  Sri Lanka 17. Emerging out of three decades of civ il conflict and the downturn brought on by the global crisis, the economy of Sri La nka has resumed strong growth in an environment of macroeconomic and financ ial stability. Real GDP grew by 8.0 per cent in 2010, establishing a higher grow th path underpinned by the peaceful domestic environment, improved in vestor confidence,  strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals and the gradual recovery of the global economy.  9Ebbing inflation and a benign inflation ou tlook has enabled the continuation of an accommodative monetary policy stance with moderation of interest rates in all market segments supporting economic act ivity. The recent floods have caused some damage to agricultural production whic h has spiked headline inflation in the past few months higher than expected earlie r. However, core inflation declined and currently remains low at single digit leve l. An encouraging improvement in the overall fiscal situation was witnessed in  2010 with the recovery in government revenue supported by the expansion of economic activity, the containment of recurrent expenditure, as well as the addr essing of certain persistent structural issues in the tax system. The budget deficit was contained within the target of 8.0 per cent of GDP in 2010, down from 9.9 per cent in 2009, and the commitment to fiscal consolidation will ensure furthe r reduction of the budge t deficit to 6.8 per cent in 2011 and to below 5 per cent in the medium te rm. The external sector, which made a remarkable turnaround since the second quarter of 2009, has continued to improve. Both exports and imports recovered strongly, while increased earnings from th e tourism industry and higher inward remittances offset the widening trade deficit, limiting the ex ternal current account deficit. Increased capital and financial flows resulted in th e balance of payments (BOP) recording a surplus in 2010, strengthening external re serves of the coun try. Supported by the favourable macroeconomic environment a nd a sound regulatory and supervisory framework, the financial sector improved and system stability st rengthened in 2010 as reflected in all prudential indicators . Banks\u2019 credit flows significantly recovered, profitability improved, capita l adequacy further increased above the threshold and  10the ratio of non-performing loans declin ed, while provisions for loan losses increased. Going forward, external shocks due  to higher food and energy prices in the global market pose some risks to the bala nce of payments and in flation outlook.     Concluding Remarks 18. While the trough of the crisis definitely  appears to be behind us and there are signs that the recovery is consolid ating, new challenges facing the global economy render it vulnerable. We have to re main vigilant and be prepared to deal with all threats, old and new, as we repair and rebuild. The global problems we are facing today are complex and not amenable to easy solutions. Many of them require significant and often painful adju stments at the national level, and in a world divided by nation-states, there is no natural constituency for the global economy. At the same time, th e global crisis has shown that the global economy as an entity is more important than ever. Gi ven the deepening inte gration of countries into the global economic and financial syst em, uncoordinated responses will lead to worse outcomes for everyone. We should coopera te not only to firmly exit from the crisis, but also to ensure that in resolvi ng this crisis, we do not sow the seeds of the next one. The IMF has to continue to weave together the fabric of international cooperation. This is in the co mmon interest of all. We must ensure that the IMF is adequately prepared for this role so that it remains relevant, legitimate and effective.   11", "23 June 11 MP.pdf": "India and the Global Financial Crisis What Have We Learnt?1 -  Duvvuri Subbarao _________________________________________________________   Thank you for inviting me to deliver the 2011 K R Narayanan Oration. It is an honour to which I attach a lot of value.   President Narayanan 2. Late President Narayanan was a distinguish ed diplomat, a reputed parliamentarian, a capable minister and above all an erudite scholar. Born at the very bottom of India\u2019s social pyramid, he rose on to occupy the highest office in the country with no assets other than hard work, integrity and humility. \u2018A working President\u2019 , as he described himself, he never allowed dogma to overwhelm his beliefs and convictions.   3. President Narayanan was in office from 1997 to 2002, a time when glob alization, as we are experiencing it in the current times, was taki ng root. At the banquet he  hosted for the visiting US President Bill Clinton in New Delhi in March 2000, President Narayanan remarked: \u201cMr. President, we do recognise and welcome the fact  that the world has been moving inevitably towards a one-world... But, for us, globalization does not mean the end of history and geography, and of the lively and exciting di versities of the world.\u201d This wa s a thoughtful remark. As much as globalization may be inevitable, history and geography need not be destiny. If we learn the lessons of experience, we will not repeat the sa me mistakes. This indeed is the topic for my                                                  1 K.R.

Is This Time Different? 4. By all accounts the 2008/09 crisis has been the deepest financia l crisis of our times. It has taken a devastating toll on global output and welfar e. Arguably, the fundamental causes of all financial crises are the same - global imbalances , loose monetary policy and high levels of leverage driven by \u2018irrational exuberance\u2019. In th at respect this crisis has been no different.   5. Where this crisis has been different, however , is in its manifestation. Most recent crises had occurred in individual emerging economies or  regions, and they were, at their core, traditional retail banking or currency crises. The countries in trouble could be rescued by multilateral interventions; besides, the advan ced countries provided a buffer for trade and financial support. In contrast, this crisis orig inated in the most advanced economy, the United States, and hit at the very core of the global financial system.  With virtually no buffers to fall back on, the crisis rapidly engulfed the whole world. Much to their dismay, emerging market economies too were soon pulled into the whirlpool.   How was India Hit by the Crisis? 6. India was no exception. We too were affect ed by the crisis. Output growth which averaged 9.5 per cent per annum during the thre e year period 2005/08 dropped to 6.8 per cent in the crisis year of 2008/09. Exports which grew at  25 per cent during 2005/ 08 decelerated to 12.2 per cent in the crisis year (2008/09) and declined by 2.2 pe r cent in 2009/10. In the pre-crisis years, we had capital flows far in excess of our  current account deficit. In contrast, during the crisis year, net capital flows were significantly s hort of the current account  deficit and this put downward pressure on the rupee. The exchange rate depreciated from ` 39.37 per dollar in January 2008 to ` 51.23 per dollar in March 2009.   7. Notwithstanding our sound banking system and relatively robust financial markets, India felt the tremors of the tectonic shocks in the gl obal financial system. Th e first round effects came through the finance channel by way of sudden stop a nd then reversal of capital flows consequent upon the global deleveraging process. This jolted our foreign exchange markets as well as our equity markets. Almost simultaneously, our credit markets came under pressure as corporates, finding that their external sour ces of funding had dried up, turn ed to domestic bank and non-bank sources for credit.  8. By far the most contagious route for crisis  transmission was the confidence channel. For weeks after the Lehman collapse in mid-September 2008, everyday there was news of yet another storied institution crashing. In this global scenario of uncertainty, the lack of confidence in advanced country markets transmitted as hicc ups to our markets too. The net result was that all our financial markets - equity, debt, m oney and foreign exchange markets - came under varying degrees of pressure. Fina lly, the transmission of the crisis through the real channel was quite straightforward as the globa l recession that followed the fina ncial crash resulted in a sharp decline in export demand for our goods and services.  Why was India Hit by the Crisis? 9. There was dismay in India that we too were affected by the crisis, and this dismay arose mainly on two counts. First, the exposure of our banks to toxic sub-prim e assets was marginal and their off balance sheet activities were limited, and so, the ar gument went, we should not have been affected by a financial sector crisis that  originated from thes e causes. Second, India\u2019s growth is driven by domestic demand and a drop in external demand, it was contended, should have caused no more than a small dent in output growth. Yet the cr isis hit us, and did so more ferociously than we thought possible. The reason for this is globalization:  India is more integrated into the global system than we tend to  acknowledge. Let me illustrate that point with some broadbrush numbers.   10. India\u2019s two way trade (merchandize exports plus imports), as a proportion of GDP, more than doubled over the past decade: from 19.6 per cent in 1998/99, the year of the Asian crisis, to 40.7 per cent in 2008/09. Note that global trade declined by 11 per cent in 2009 as a result of the crisis in contrast to a robus t average growth of 8.6 per cent during the previous few years 2004/07. Such a sharp collapse in world tr ade had an impact on our export demand demonstrating that our trade integration was quite deep.   11. If our trade integration was deep, our financ ial integration was even deeper. A measure of financial integration is the ratio of total extern al transactions (gross current account flows plus gross capital account flows) to GDP. This rati o had more than doubled from 44 per cent in 1998/99 to 112 per cent in 2008/09 evid encing the depth of India\u2019s fi nancial integration. In sum, the reason India was affected by the crisis, despite mitigating factors, is its deepened trade and financial integration with the world.   Managing Globalization 12. What the experience of the crisis demonstrated  clearly was the pow er of globalization. Globalization is a double edged sword; it op ens up incredible opport unities but also poses immense challenges. India surely benefitted from opening up to the world but had also incurred costs on that count. The challenge for India, and indeed for all Emerging Market Economies (EMEs), is really to minimize the costs a nd maximize the benefits of globalization.   Lessons of Crisis 13. A lot is being written about how this crisis  has been too important to waste, how we should learn the lessons of the crisis and apply them in a Sc humpeterian creative destruction mode. Some people have, however, questioned the wisdom of drawing lessons even before the crisis is fully be hind us. When Zhou Enlai, former Chinese Prime Minister, was asked what he thought of the French Revolution, he said it was too early to say. Historians who take a long view may agree with Zhou Enlai but practical policy makers do not enjoy that luxury. So, let me use the opportunity of this platform to draw out eight big picture lessons of the crisis.       Lesson 1: In a globalizing world, decoupling does not work 14. The crisis challenged many of our beliefs, and among the casualties is the decoupling hypothesis. The decoupling hypothesis, which was inte llectually fashionabl e before the crisis, held that even if advanced economies went into a downturn, EMEs would not be affected because of their improved macroeconomic manage ment, robust external reserves and healthy banking sectors. Yet the crisis affected all EMEs , admittedly to different extents, bringing into question the validity of the decoupling hypothesis.  15. Some analysts argue against such an outri ght dismissal of the decoupling hypothesis and suggest a more nuanced evaluation. Recent IMF research2 in fact illustrates that the transmission of distress from advanced economies to EMEs took place in three distinct phases. The first phase runs from the time early signs of the crisis appeared in mid-2007 till the Lehman collapse in September 2008. During this period, the growth performance of EMEs outshone that of advanced economies indicating decoupling. The second phase, star ting with the Lehman collapse till the first quarter of 2009 was one of \u2018recoupli ng\u2019 when advanced economies pulled EMEs too into the downturn. The third phase started in the second quarter of 2009 when EMEs started recovering from the crisis ah ead of advanced economies sugge sting a shift once again to decoupling.   16. So, have EMEs decoupled from the advanced  economies? The answer has necessarily to be nuanced. A useful way to visualize decoupling in the wake of the crisis is to distinguish between \u2018trend\u2019 and \u2018cycle\u2019 decoupling. \u2018Trend \u2019 decoupling is reflected by the widening gap between the trend rates of  growth of EMEs and of advanced economies. This is evidently owing                                                  2 Llaudes, Ricardo, Ferhan Salman, and Mali Chivakul, \u2018T he Impact of the Great Recession on Emerging Markets\u2019. IMF Working Paper 237, October 2010. to the growing weight of domestic factors, ma inly consumption, in the EMEs\u2019 growth process. However, given that there is still significant integration between the two groups of countries, cycles are still coupled. From a \u2018l essons\u2019 perspective, what this means is that EMEs should focus on strengthening domestic drivers of demand a nd instituting automatic stabilizers to buffer themselves against cyclical shocks from advanced economies.                                     Lesson 2: Global imbalances need to be redressed for the sake of global stability  17. No crisis as complex as this has a simp le or a single cause. In popular perception, the collapse of Lehman Brothers in mid-September 2008 will remain marked as the trigger of the crisis. At one level that may well be true. Inde ed, I can visualize future text books in finance dividing the world into \u2018before Lehman\u2019 and \u2018after Lehman\u2019. Bu t if we probe deeper, we will learn that at the heart of the crisis were two root causes - the build up of global imbalances and developments in the financial markets over the la st two decades. And received wisdom today is that these two root causes are interconnected, and that financial market developments were in a sense driven by the global imbalances.   18. Global macro imbalances got built up because of the large savings and current account surpluses in China and much of Asia in wake of the East Asian Crisis a decade ago. These were mirrored by large increases in leveraged consump tion and current account de ficits in the US. In short, Asia produced and America consumed. Be tween the US consump tion boom and the Asian savings glut, there is a raging de bate on what was the cause and wh at was the effect. Regardless, the bottom line is that one was simply the mirr or of the other and th e two share a symbiotic relationship.  19. And how did these imbalances build up? The answer lies in globalization - globalization of trade, of labour and of finance. The world witnessed a phenomenal e xpansion in global trade over the last three decades; gl obal trade as a proportion of gl obal GDP increased from 34 per cent in 1980 to 51 per cen t in 2007, just before the crisis hit us.3 Globalization of finance was even more prolific, especially over the last decade. For the world taken together, the ratio of                                                  3 Calculations based on IMF Direction of Trade Statistics, June 2010. foreign assets and foreign liabilities to GDP ro se from 133 per cent in 1994 to over 300 per cent in 2008.4  The impact of globalization of labour wa s by far more striking. Emerging Asia added nearly three billion to the world\u2019 s pool of labour as it integrated  with the rest of the world over the last two decades thus hugely improving its comparative advantage. Together, the three dimensions of globalization - trade, finance an d labour - helped emerging Asia multiply by a factor its exports to the advan ced economies. The result was large and persistent current account surpluses in the Asian economies and correspo nding current account deficits in the importing advanced economies.  20. The chain of causation from these imbalances  to the financial cr isis is interesting although not obvious. As Asia accumulated savings and simultaneously maintained competitive exchange rates, the savings turned into central  bank reserves. Central ba nks, in turn, invested these savings not in any large, diversified portfolio but in g overnment bonds of the advanced economies. This in turn drove do wn risk free real interest ra tes to historically low levels triggering phenomenal credit expansion and dropping of the guard on credit standards, erosion of credit quality and search for yield, all of whic h combined to brew the crisis to its explosive dimensions.    21. It is argued that if the US Fed had refused to supply the incipient demand for liquidity in the late 1990s and early 2000s, higher interest rates could have prevented the borrowing boom and the follow on widespread deterioration of fi nancial standards and the subsequent melt down. But this also would have meant lower growth in the US and the rest of the world. The short point is that even as macroeconomic imbalances should not  be allowed to proliferate, it is necessary to                                                  4 Calculations based on IMF Balance of Payments Year Book, 2010. balance the need for global economic growth agai nst the disruptions which follow the unwinding of such imbalances.  22. So, where do we go from here? The G-20 is now actively enga ged in the cha llenging task of redressing structural imbalances in th e global economy. At their Pittsburgh Summit in September 2009, the G-20 leaders agreed on a \u2018Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth\u2019 and committed to a \u2018Mutual Assessment Pro cess\u2019 (MAP) which is a peer review of each country\u2019s progress towards meeting the sh ared objectives underlying the framework. Recognizing that global imbalances which had na rrowed during the crisis started widening again in the exit phase, driven mainly by the uneven r ecovery around the world, th e G-20 resolved that promoting external sustainability should be the focus of the next stage of the MAP and entrusted this task to a Framewor k Working Group (FWG).   23. India is privileged in co-cha iring, together with Canada, the FWG for managing the task of developing the indicative guidelines for assess ing and addressing persistent global imbalances. The FWG has adopted a two-stage approach: a lim ited number of indicators will guide the initial assessment process, while a broader set - includi ng qualitative ones - will be used in the second stage to inform an in-depth external sustainabil ity assessment. The success of this initiative is critical for redressing the problem of global imbalances.        Lesson 3: Global problems require global coordination 24. The crisis demonstrated the interconnecte dness of the world thr ough trade, finance and confidence channels. What originated as a bubble in the US housing sector soon snowballed into a crisis and radiated in two diffe rent ways - first, in a geographical sense, from the US to other advanced economies and then to the rest of th e world; and second, in a sectoral sense, from housing to all productive sectors. Even as each country started dousing the fires on its own, it was soon realized that the effort was in vain an d that global coordination is a necessary condition for managing a global crisis.   25. From that perspective, the London G-20 Su mmit in April 2009 will go down in history as a clear turning point when the leaders of the world showed extraordinary determination and unity. Sure, there were differences, but they were debated and discussed and compromises were made without eroding the end goal - that is to end the crisis. This resulted in an agreed package of measures having both domestic and intern ational components but all of them to be implemented in coordination, and indeed in sy nchronization where necessary. The entire range of crisis response measures - ac commodative monetary stance, fis cal stimulus, debt and deposit guarantees, capital injection, asse t purchases, currency swaps - a ll derived in varying degrees from the G-20 package.   26. Now, as we exit from the crisis, there are concerns and apprehensions that the vaunted unity that the G-20 had shown during the crisis  is dissipating. But might it also be a tad unrealistic to expect the degree of unity shown in managing the crisis to also be shown in addressing \u2018peace time\u2019 issues? The focus of G-20 now is to flesh out the agenda for economic and financial restructuring at natio nal and international levels so that the world can prevent, or at any rate minimize the probability of, another crisis of the type we have gone through. Differences of opinion, when the ag enda is so broad, are not only to  be expected, but may in fact have a positive influence in determining what is collectively optimal.   27. The common thread running through the en tire G-20 agenda is the need for global cooperation in solving our most pressing problem s of today. The crisis has taught us that no country can be an island and that economic and fi nancial disruptions anywhe re can cause ripples, if not waves, everywhere. The crisis also taug ht us that given the de epening integration of countries into the global economic  and financial system, uncoordina ted responses will lead to worse outcomes for everyone.   28. The global problems we are facing today are complex and not amenable to easy solutions. Many of them require significant and often painful adjustments at the national level. Because short term national inte rests conflict with globally optimal solutions, it is quite understandable that there are di fferences of views within th e G-20. We must remember though that in a world divided by nation-states, there is no natural constituency for the global economy. At the same time, the global crisis has shown that the global economy as an entity is more important than ever and that global coordination to solve glob al problems is critical.             Lesson 4: Price stability and macro economic stability do not guarantee financial stability  29. The years before the crisis were charac terized by steady growth and low and stable inflation in advanced economies and rapid gr owth and development in EMEs. The so called \u2018Great Moderation\u2019 prompted a growing consensu s around the view that the best practice in monetary policy framework is the pursuit of a single target (price stability) by means of a single instrument (short term policy interest rate). The success of the Great Moderation fortified the argument that price stability is  a necessary and (a nearly) sufficient condition for economic growth and for financial stability. Central bankers believed they ha d discovered the holy grail.   30. That sense of triumph was deflated by th e unravelling of the crisis. As the global financial sector came to the brink of a collapse even in the midst of a period of extraordinary price stability, it became clear that price st ability does not necessarily guarantee financial stability.   31. Indeed the experience of the crisis has prompt ed an even stronger assertion - that there is a trade off between price stability  and financial stability, and that the more successful a central bank is with price stability, the more likely it is to imperil financial stability. The argument goes as follows. The extended period of steady growth and low and stable inflation during the Great Moderation lulled central banks into complacency. Only with the benefit of hindsight is it now clear that the prolonged period of price stability  blindsided policy makers to the cancer of financial instability growing in the underbelly.   32. A dominant issue in the wake of the crisis ha s been the role of central banks in preventing asset price bubbles. The monetary stance of studied indifference to  asset price inflation stemmed from the famous Greenspan orthodoxy which can be  summarized as follows.  First, asset price bubbles are hard to identify on a re al time basis, and the fundame ntal factors th at drive asset prices are not directly observable. A central ba nk should not therefore second guess the market.  Second, monetary policy is too blunt an instrument to counteract asset price booms. And third, central banks can \u2018clean up the mess\u2019 after the bubble bursts. The surmise therefore was that the cost-benefit calculus of a more activist monetary stance of \u201cleaning against the wind\u201d was clearly negative.   33. The crisis has dented th e credibility of the Greensp an orthodoxy. The emerging view post-crisis is that prev enting an asset price build up should be within the remit of  a central bank. Opinion is divided, however, on whether central  banks should prevent asset bubbles through monetary policy action or thr ough regulatory action. On one si de, there is a purist view questioning the efficacy of resorting to m onetary tightening to check speculative bubbles. Opposed to this is the argument that a necessa ry condition for speculative excesses is abundant liquidity, and that controlling liqui dity which is within the rem it of monetary policy should be the first line of defence agai nst \u2018irrational exuberance\u2019.   34. No matter how this debate settle s, a clear, if also disquietin g lesson of the crisis is that price stability and macroeconomic stabil ity do not guarantee financial stability.            Lesson 5: Microprudential regulatio n and supervision need to be supplemented by macroprudential oversight  35. The crisis has clearly demonstr ated that a collection of heal thy financial institutions does not necessarily make a healthy financial se ctor. This is because there are complex interconnections in the financial sector across banks, other financial institutions, markets, and geographies and a problem in any part of the system can rapidly transmit through the system, cascade across layers and develop into a crisis. Systemic safety can also be jeopardized by procyclicality. As the crisis demonstrated, ther e is a strong collective tendency among financial entities to overexpose themselves to the same t ype of risk during an upturn and become overly risk averse during a downturn. Importantly, individual instituti ons, and indeed microprudential oversight too, fail to take into account the spill over impact of the actions of the rest of the financial system on them. This raises the para dox of the fallacy of composition. What is good from an individual institution\u2019s point of view can become disruptive,  and even destructive, if all institutions act in a similar way.   36. That a bubble that started in the US housing sector snowballed into a major crisis is a vivid illustration of the risks arising from the interconnectedness of the global financial system and the risks of procyclicality. Th e lesson clearly is that as much  as micropruden tial supervision is necessary, it needs to be supplemented by macr oprudential oversight to prevent systemic risk building up.  37. Macroprudential oversight requires both analytical sophistication and good judgement. Regulators need to be able to analyze the nature a nd extent of risk and be able to make informed judgement on when and what type of countercyclical buffers they must impose. Both type I and type II errors - imposing buffers too early out of excessive caution or delaying imposition of buffers till it is too late to avert an implosi on - can be costly in macroeconomic terms.    Lesson 6: Capital controls are not only unavoidable, but advisable in certain circumstances  38. As EMEs started recovering from the crisis earlier than advanced economies, they also began exiting from the crisis driven accommoda tive monetary stance ahead of the advanced economies. This multi-speed recovery and the consequent differential exit have triggered speculative capital flows into EM Es resulting in currency apprec iation unrelated to economic fundamentals. This poses complex policy manage ment challenges. Currenc y appreciation erodes export competitiveness. Interventi on in the forex market to preven t appreciation entails costs. If the resultant liquidity is left unsterilized, it could potentially fuel inflationary pressures. If the resultant liquidity is sterilized, it puts upward pressure on interest rates which not only hurts competitiveness, but also, in a curious variation of  the Dutch disease, encourages further flows.   39. Capital inflows far in excess of a country \u2019s absorptive capacity could pose problems other than currency appreciation. Speculative  flows on the look out for quick returns can potentially lead to asset price build up. Also, in the current juncture, one of the driving forces behind hardening commodity prices in recent months  is the excess liquidity in the global system which has possibly triggered financialization of commodities.   40. Quite unsurprisingly, the old debate about whether capital controls are a legitimate policy option has resurfaced again. This is a debate that has traditionally frowned on moderation. Critics maintain that capital controls are distortionary, larg ely ineffective, difficult to implement, easy to evade and that they enta il negative externalities. On the othe r hand, supporters of capital controls argue that controls preserve monetary policy autonomy, save steriliza tion costs and tilt the composition of foreign liabilities toward long- term maturities and ensure macroeconomic and financial stability.   41. The debate on capital cont rols resurfaced after the As ian crisis of the mid-1990s, especially as one of the root ca uses of the crisis wa s the open capital accounts of the East Asian economies. However, as the Asian economies recovered in quick order, regained their export competitiveness and started building up external reserves for self-insurance, the debate was not pursued to its logical conclusion, and the orthodoxy that capital controls are undesirable persisted.   42. The recent crisis has, however, been a clear turning point in the worldview on capital controls. Notably, the IMF put out a policy note 5 in February 2010 that reversed its long held orthodoxy that capital controls ar e inadvisable always and everyw here. The note has referred to certain \u2018 circumstances in which capital controls c an be a legitimate component of the policy response to surges in capital flows \u2019. The World Bank6 and the Asian Development Bank Outlook - 2010 too echoed these views.   43. A useful way of assessing the capital acc ount management of an EME is to draw a distinction between \u2018strategic\u2019 and \u2018tactical\u2019 controls. Strategic c ontrols would involve defining a long term policy indicating the inter se  preference, or the hierarc hy of preferences as it were, across different types of capital flows and the controls that will be deployed to operationalize that policy. Strategic controls gi ve stakeholders a clear and pred ictable framework of rules to make informed choices and to manage risks, a nd they give policy makers sufficient levers to calibrate the flows; in essence they define the boundaries of the playing field. Tactical controls, on the other hand, introduce barriers into the playing field itself. They are deployed                                                  5 Ostry, Jonathan D. and Others (2010), \u201cCapital Infl ows: The Role of Controls\u201d, IMF Staff Position Note, SPN/10/04, February 19, 2010. 6 World Bank: Global Monitoring Report 2009: A Development Emergency.

By their very na ture, tactical  controls introduce a new element of uncertainty into th e calculations of both domestic and foreign stakeholders.   44. India\u2019s approach to capital account manageme nt is typically strate gic. For example, we have an explicitly expressed preference for long term over short term flows and equity over debt flows, and we have used both price based and quantity based controls to operationalize this policy. We have, of course, periodically recalibrate d elements of the strategy in pursuit of capital account liberalization. An important lesson from Indi a\u2019s experience is that even with relatively large swings in capital flows during the crisis, the pressure to use tactical controls did not build up because the strategic controls provided automatic buffers.   45. Even as we debate what EMEs should or should not do to manage excess capital flows, we should remember that to the extent that lumpy and volatile flows are a spillover from policy choices of advanced economies, managing capital flows should not be treated as an exclusive problem of emerging market economies. How this bur den is to be shared raises both intellectual and practical challenges. The intellectual challe nge is to build a better understanding of the forces driving capital flows, what type of polic y instruments, including capital controls, work and in what situations. The practical challenge is the need to reach a shared understanding on a framework for cross border spillovers of domes tic policies in capital-originating countries, and the gamut of policy responses by capital receivin g countries.      Lesson 7: Economics is not physics 46. A few months into the crisis, the Queen happened to be at the London School of Economics and asked a perfectly sensible questi on: \u2018how come none of the economists saw the crisis coming\u2019. The Queen\u2019s question resonated with people around the worl d who felt that they had been let down by economics and economists. As  economists saw their profession discredited and their reputations dented, the economic crisis  soon turned into a crisis in economics.   47. What went wrong with economics? I t now seems that by far the most egregious fault of economics, one that led it astray, ha s been to project it like an exact science. The charge is that economists suffered from \u2018physics envy\u2019 which led them to formulate elegant theories and models - using sophisticated mathematics with  impressive quantitative finesse -  deluding themselves and the world at large that their mode ls have more exactitude than they actually did.  48. Admittedly, in a limited sense there may be some parallels between economics and physics. But similarity in a few laws does not mean  similarity in the basic nature of the academic discipline. The fundamental difference between physics and economics is that physics deals with the physical universe which is governed by  immutable laws, beyond the pale of human behaviour. Economics, in contrast, is a social science whose laws are influenced by human behaviour. Simply put, I cannot change the mass of  an electron no matter how I behave but I can change the price of a derivative by my behaviour.   49. The laws of physics are universal in space and time. The laws of economics are very much a function of the context. Going back to the earlier example, the mass of an electron does not change whether we are in the world of Newton or of Einstein. But in the world of economics, how firms, households and governments behave is  altered by the reigning economic ideology of the time. To give another example, there is no thing absolute, for example, about savings being equal to investment or supply equalling demand as maintained by classical economics but there is something absolute about ener gy lost being equal to energy gained as enunciated by classical physics.   50. In natural sciences, progress is a two way st reet. It can run from empirical findings to theory or the other way round. The famous Mich elson-Morley experiment that found that the velocity of light is constant led to the theory  of relativity - an ex ample of progression from practice to theory. In the reve rse direction, the ferocious sear ch now under way for the Higgs Boson - the God particle - whic h has been predicted by quantum  theory is an example of traversing from theory to practice. In economic s, on the other hand, where the human dimension is paramount, the progression has necessarily to be one way, from empi rical finding to theory. There is a joke that if something works in practi ce, economists run to see if it works in theory. Actually, I don\u2019t see the joke; that is indeed the way it should be.   51. Karl Popper, by far the most influential philo sopher of science of the twentieth century, propounded that a good theory is one that gives rise  to falsifiable hypothes es. By this measure, Einstein\u2019s General Theory was a good theory as it led to the hypothesis about the curvature of space under the force of gravity which indeed was verified by scientists from observations made during a solar eclipse from the West African is lands of Sao Tome and Principe. Economics on the other hand cannot stand the scrutiny of the fals ifiable hypothesis test since empirical results in economics are a function of the context.  52. The short point is that economics cannot la y claim to the immutability, universality, precision and exactitude of physics. Take the recent financial crisis. It is not as if no one saw the pressures building up. There were a respectabl e number of economists who warned of the perilous consequences of the build-up of gl obal imbalances, said that this was simply unsustainable and predicted a currency collapse. In  the event, we did have the system imploding but not as a currency collapse but as a melt down of the financial system.   53. We will be better able to safeguard financial stability both at global and national levels if we remember that economics is a social scienc e and real world outcomes are influenced at a fundamental level by human behaviour.   Lesson 8: Having a sense of economic history is important to prevent and resolve financial crises  54. Let me finish with the last lesson which is  on a larger canvas - that having a sense of economic history is important to prevent and to resolve financial crises. In their painstakingly researched book, This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly , Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart argue that every time a crisis  occurs and experts ar e confronted with the question of why they could not, based on past e xperience, see it coming, they would argue that past experience was no guide as  circumstances had changed. Yet this \u2018this time is different\u2019 argument does not hold. Reinhart and Rogoff put forward impressive  evidence showing that over eight hundred years, all financial crises can be tr aced to the same fundam ental causes as if we learnt nothing from one crisis to another. If only teaching in economics had included a study of economic history, perhaps we can avoid repeating history, never mind as a farce or a tragedy.  ", "10 May 11 MP.pdf": "Policy Discipline and Spillovers in  an Inter-connected Global Economy1 - Duvvuri Subbarao _________________________________________________________   The interconnected world is  not new. We have been living in it for some time. For half a century, e xports, international capital flows, and foreign direct investment have been growing much fa ster than GDP, binding economies ever more tightly together. In many ways, this  process has been a tremendous force for good. My own country, India, is testament to that. Integration with the world contributed to growth, lif ting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But in the past few years, we have seen that these linkages can also have tremendous costs: developments in other countries, ove r which we have no control, can without warning plunge countries into difficulty or even crisis.   2. So, we need to find ways to maximi ze the benefits of globalization while minimizing its costs. To do this, there are tw o basic imperatives. First, we need to better understand the ways in which we are linked together. And then, we need to translate this understanding into coordinated policy acti on. That is, we need to consider ways in which countries can impose policy discipline on one another\u2019s behaviour, to minimize the risks that thei r policies could pose for others. I would like to focus my brief remarks today on th ese two tasks: understanding the nature of linkages and doing something about them. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a01\u00a0Comments \u00a0by\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Duvvuri\u00a0Subbarao, \u00a0Governor, \u00a0Reserve\u00a0Bank\u00a0of\u00a0India\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0SNB\u2010IMF\u00a0Conference \u00a0on\u00a0The\u00a0International\u00a0 Monetary\u00a0 System,\u00a0Zurich,\u00a0May\u00a010,\u00a02011.\u00a0 Understanding Linkages  3. We cannot begin to impose policy disc ipline on countries until we improve our understanding of the linkages amongst economies. Recent experience shows that our understanding of the nature of thes e linkages is seriously deficient. In fact, standard econometric models still suggest that shocks in one country have very small effects on other countries. They do that  because they assume that trade is the primary channel for transmitting these shocks across countries, and trade moves in line with GDP.  Both these assumption ar e flawed. As we all know, the 2008 crisis originated in the housing sector which is a quintessentially non-traded good.   4. In addition, we saw during the cris is that the financial channel is tremendously important, in ways that are still poorly understood. For example, after Lehman collapsed, interbank rates in I ndia soared, by much more than in many other emerging markets, even though India\u2019s banking system is relatively closed.   5. Finally, there is another channel, li ttle analysed and even less understood, arising from the global nature of mode rn industries. For example, in 2001 the collapse of the IT industry was a world-wi de phenomenon, one that was felt even in India, with a magnitude that  would never have been pred icted by trade or financial equations. Right now, we are worrying about the implications of Japan\u2019s difficulties for global supply chains. But we have no framework for analyzing these effects. So, further research into linkages is needed, and the IM F is well-placed to lead such an effort.   Dealing with Spillovers  6. Once we gain a better understandi ng of the way in which economies are linked together, we can begin to devise better ways of dealing with them. But this will also be a difficult task.    7. Consider first the relatively straight forward case where bad policies in one country can have negative consequences for the rest of the world. The most obvious example is poor financial regulati on, which was one of the root causes of the 2008 global crisis. In principle, it should be easy to deal with  this problem since bad policies are harmful for all. Yet as we are seeing, there are immense difficulties in agreeing what good financial regulation en tails. Perhaps this is not surprising. After all, it was not too long ago that the systems in advanced countries were considered \u201cbest practices\u201d, which Em erging Market Economies (EMEs) were advised to emulate. So, we now need so me fundamental research into what good regulation really entails, and this resear ch would do well to consider our total experience - not just that of advanced economies but also of EMEs.  8. Consider now a more complex case, where there are both positive and negative spillovers to analyse. A prom inent example is th e second round of US quantitative easing, QE2. From the perspective of EMEs, QE2 may have had significant negative extern alities. After QE2 was a nnounced in August 2010, the prospect of easy liquidity in the US seem ed to prompt a large increase in capital flows to EMEs, threatening domestic price a nd financial stability. It also seemed to contribute to rising global commodity prices , intensifying inflat ionary pressures. This combination has put some EMEs in  a policy bind, as rising inflation necessitates tighter monetary policy, but hi gher interest rates will only intensify volatile capital inflows, potentially puttin g more pressure on exchange rates and domestic stability. In India\u2019s case, the concerns on this account currently are less acute since capital inflows ar e needed to finance our cu rrent account deficit. Yet even for us, the composition of the inflow s remains an issue. About three-quarters of the current account deficit since 2009 has been financed by volatile capital inflows.  9. At the same time, it must be acknowledged that QE2 has also had positive externalities. It seems to have improved confidence in the US economy, especially by putting an end to deflationary fears. So, to the extent that it has contributed to a stronger and more durable recovery in the US, it has also benefitted EMEs, including India.  10. This case illustrates that before one  imposes discipline on spillovers, it will be critical to assess their impact. Firs t, one would need to  identify the various external effects, quantify them, and find some way of netting them, to see whether the overall impact has been positive or nega tive. Then, one would need to balance these external considerations against the purely domestic benefits. Merely to state these issues is sufficient to illustrate the magnitude of the challenge before us.    11. Finally, consider the case where one country\u2019s policy has a positive impact on the domestic economy, but a negative one on the rest of the world. A well-known example is when a country mainta ins an undervalued exchange rate. In India\u2019s case, the rupee\u2019s exchange rate has been virtually flexible in the past two years, as we have not intervened in the foreign exchange market. The small increase in reserves reflects various accruals, interest earnings and valuation changes. This policy has served the econom y well, as it has allowed the exchange rate to serve as a buffer, depreciating to help the economy when it was weak and appreciating to reduce excess demand wh en it was strong. The policy has also minimized the danger that foreign inflows would be attracted by \u201cone-way bets\u201d on appreciation, or that domes tic firms would borrow excessively from abroad without hedging their exposure. But at the same time, India\u2019s policy means that it is subject to negative externalities from countries th at maintain undervalued exchange rates, undermining our competitiveness in these ma rkets and our efforts to contain the current account deficit.   12. The underlying question is about when and in what circumstances countries can intervene in the forex market to manage  the exchange rate. In particular, is it appropriate to maintain an undervalued exch ange rate for purely trade advantage? But equally, we recognize that there will be numerous difficulties. How can undervaluation be proved in a rigorous wa y? And where would one draw the line between an acceptable undervaluation, and a more serious one? The challenge is even more complex if the problem is define d in terms of current account surpluses, because there can be surpluses for good reasons (such as when the population is aging, leading the country to  lend to younger, more dynamic countries that need to borrow) or bad ones, where the surplu ses arise because of distortions.   Establishing a Code of Discipline  13. But let\u2019s say that we es tablish a case for doing some thing about a spillover. The first step would be to develop a consen sus on a code of discipline. As one IEO study noted:  It is now recognized that a world economy dominated by integrated markets, and with coun tries at very different levels of economic and institutional development, requires a system of global, yet non-binding, rules of conduct (\u201csoft law\u201d) that are internationally promulgated and nationally implemented\u2026.IMF surveillance has been seen as the instrument to disseminate the new sets of rules across the Fund\u2019s near-universal membership, and to facilitate their implem entation by member countries.2 14. Still, developing consen sus on a code of discipline will be  challenging. I have already alluded to the difficulties in  reaching international agreement just in the specific field of financial regulation. It  will be even more difficult to reach a consensus on broader economic policy. Indee d, the history of the past few decades is an object lesson in how problematic such a process could be. The first major code that emerging countries were expe cted to follow was the Washington Consensus of the 1990s. But not all countries benefitted sufficiently from these policies and at some point, there was a backlash.  The second wave of consensus came during the 2000s in the form of a plethora of international standards and codes. There was also a consensus that fi scal policy should aim at low levels of public debt, that monetary policy should ta rget inflation, and that regulation should \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a02\u00a0IEO\u00a0Background\u00a0 Paper\u00a0 BP/08/10 \u00a0\u201cIMF\u00a0Surveillance: \u00a0A\u00a0Case\u00a0 Study\u00a0on\u00a0IMF\u00a0Governance\u201d. \u00a0be separated from monetary policy, and us ed to preserve fina ncial stability. The crisis has forced a rethinking on all of thes e. But a new consensus to replace the old one has not yet emerged, as the IMF conference held in March 2011 amply demonstrated.   Imposing Discipline  15. But assume we overcome this hurdle a nd reach a consensus on \u201cthe rules of the game\u201d, at least in a particular area such as, say, exchange  rate policy. How could the international community impose discipline on a country? Trying to do so through international agreements could c onfront two major challenges. First, countries could be reluct ant to commit, because they are unsure how the commitments would affect the domestic economy. Second, the effectiveness of such commitments could be diluted if th ere is no true \u201cbuy in\u201d by countries. The experience at the IMF with the 2007 Surveillance Deci sion, which proved impossible to implement is a cautionary tale . So, too, is the expe rience of the WTO, where countries have often evaded the sp irit of trade commitments by resorting to protectionist measures on which no commit ments were given, such as undervalued exchange rates, taxation and subsidies, labour laws, investment  norms, intellectual property rights and environment laws.   Conclusion  16. So, how do we move forw ard? The way ahead is far from clear. But let me sketch out a road map.   17. The first step, as I mentioned, is to  develop a framework for understanding the linkages amongst economies. This is currently being done through the IMF spillover reports, a most welcome initiative. But let me put the challenge squarely. We need to develop a proper framework for analyzing these linkages. And we cannot do this by using the existing trade equations, and attributing all the other spillovers to exogenous financial shocks. We  need a deeper, truer, understanding of the channels and mechanisms that link our  economies together. So, the IMF has an important opportunity to contribute to th is understanding through its own research.  18. Second, we need to move toward a new consensus on economic policies, that is to say new norms against which c ountry behaviour can be assessed. We have made considerable progress - though stil l not enough - on fina ncial regulation. But we have only just started developing a new framework for macroeconomic policy, and defining the proper relationship between  macro, growth, and financial policies. Again, the Fund could make a valuable cont ribution in this area , as well, both by advancing our theoretical understandings and by synthesizing the policy lessons learned by its member countries. As I men tioned, there is much for the world to learn by studying the experien ces of the EMEs, as well as the most advanced countries.  19. Third, because our understanding of spillovers and best practices remains limited, it is far too early to think of reaching new formal international agreements on policy behaviour. Instead, countries will prefer to proceed through more exchange of information, peer review processes and ad hoc international agreements depending on the situation prevailing at any point of time. In other words, we will have to proceed by enc ouraging voluntary compliance by members, while also using peer group/multilateral sp illover assessments as a soft pressure. The template for such an approach is the G-20 MAP process. The forthcoming reports on country imbalances, and how they  might affect the ot her G-20 members, will give us an opportunity to exert peer  pressure on countries whose policies may lead to dangerous spillovers.  20. Finally, we will need to come up with enforcement mechanisms on countries that create negative external ities for the global economy despite multilateral or peer assessment cautioning them about the spillover costs their policies generate for other economies. Since we are far away from a situation where sanctions could be employed, we will need to use incentives. For example, perhaps policy agreements could be reached whereby some countries abandon policies that are creating negative spillovers in return for other countries taking policy action with positive external spillovers for them. Designing such deals and getting countries to agree to them, howev er, will remain a major challenge.  21. In sum, before we can start imposing policy discipline, we will need to put in place the needed building blocks. We need to identify linkages, assess spillovers, and establish norms of behaviour. Then, once these norms are established, we can proceed to a code of disc ipline, with rewards and eventually perhaps even sanctions. It is a long road ahead. But the journey is not only worthwhile; in our interdependent world, it is necessary.     Annex  In the G-20 debate on spillovers, EME\u2019s have emphasized that:   (a) even among G-20 countries, policy shapers are differe nt from policy takers, and most EMEs fall in the latter category (the policies of EMEs taken together, though, could have major global ramifications unlike the actions of a single EME),   (b) the available policy space may vary across countries and over time (i.e. countries with ma naged capital account and exchange rate could enjoy greater policy space than co untries with open capital account and flexible exchange rate),   (c) spillover management that may involve some sacrifice of domestic policy goals could be feasible on ly when every country pursues spillover-sensitive national policies, and the global governance structure would need to ensure th at, using a mix of both persuasion and multilateral enforcement, and most importantly   (d) global safety nets should be strong enough with easier access norms to encourage countries to voluntarily adopt the multilateral norms.

I look forward to this forum emerging as a leading platform for thoughtful discussions on contemporary economic and policy issues.  The conference is being attended by a host of dignitaries from  India and  abroad , and I am sure  their insights  on a vast canvas of topics will enhance our understanding of current and future issues . In my address today , I propose to focus on a matter that is now in everyone\u2019s mind , ranging from the general public to policy makers  in India  and across the world, i.e., inflation.         2. The global economy is going through a n extremely uncertain period amid st the simultaneous inter play of various headwinds  \u2013 a lingering  war and enduring  COVID ; the sharp rise in energy  and other commodity  prices ; strains in global supply chains ; and worsening food security . In several economies, inflation is ruling at levels not seen by the recent generations . Parallels are being drawn with  the inflation  era of the 1970s . Inflati on is running well above targets for a prolonged period and threatening to unhinge inflation expectations . Central banks have begun delivering bigger and quicker  policy rate hikes  to restore price  stability , even as the global  economy is struggling to  recover  fully from the scars inflicted by the COVID -19 pandemic . The sharply tightening financial conditions due to the ongoing monetary policy normali sation on the one hand and the persisting geopolitical tensions on the other pose significant downside risks to near-term global economic prospects . They are also 2  sparking  stagflation concerns worldwide, with even talk of recession in some parts of the world .  Globalisation and Inflation  3. Over the years, globalisation of trade and capital flows had facilitated increased productivity and lower cost of tradeable goods and services . With access to information, communicatio n and transportation technology  and the advent of multinational companies , production hubs  proliferated at multiple locations , leading to the emergence of global value chains. Globalisation also fostered competition, efficiency and innovation . Increased flow of trade, know -how , people and ideas bridged the technology gap, improved institutional capacity and accelerated the accumulation of physical and human capital in emerging markets . The result was higher growth and lifting of millions out of poverty .   4. More importantly, g lobalisation -led produ ctivity gains contributed to a trend decline of inflation across countrie s. More and more countries, including emerging market economies ( EMEs ), strengthened their monetary policy frameworks  with a number of them  adopting  inflation targeting.  There was growing talk of globalisation leading to sustained disinflationary forces , technology  diffusion and competition . We witnessed low and stable inflation in advanced economies ( AEs) and several EMEs beginning the 1990s and through the second decade of the new millennium.   5. With greater trade and financial integration, the domestic econom ies get more exposed to global shocks  including volatile short -term capital flows . For instance, global shocks to food, energy and commodity prices affect inflation in every  countr y. During the  COVID -19 pandemic and now 3  due to the war in Europe, there are clear signs of transmission of  global  shocks to generali sed and synchronised inflation across the world.   6. The recent upsurge in  inflation due to the black swan event, i.e., the war in Europe, on top of another such event, i.e., the Covid -19 pandemic offers a classic example of the globalised nature of current inflation. Around 77 per cent of countries reported acceleration in inflation in 2021 and this proportion is expected to rise further to 90 per cent in 2022, according to the IMF\u2019s latest projections. Moreover, f or advanced economies,  against an inflation target of 2 per cent, and emerging market economies , against an average target of abou t 3-5 per cent, two -thirds are witnessing inflation above 7 per cent1. While global factors have always been an important driver of domestic inflation, what we have witnessed over the past three years is the more protracted and sizeable role of global factors in proportions not witnessed in decades. These factors  have an even more conspicuous effect on net commodity importing countries like India.   7. With the origins of this inflation being essentially  in the supply side,  energy and food prices account for more than 50 per cent of the rise in prices. There are also increasing signs of sectoral price spillovers , given that the rise in global energy and commodity prices  quickly translate into higher input price pressures. While in some advanced economies , pricing power of firms has increased significantly due to strong domestic demand since 2021, other advanced economies and emerging market economies  have just started ex periencing such pressures beginning 2022. Household inflation expectations have started firming up, though they are                                                            1 Based on current inflation data from Bloomberg.  4  not severely unanchored at this stage.  Overall, we are now living in an era of globalisation of inflation amidst growing deglobalisation of world trade.   8. The persistence of inflation at elevated levels has also raised the debate as to whether the  much required  monetary actions to  contain inflation will end in hard landing (a global recession) or will the monetary authorities be able to manage soft landing (a moderation in inflation closer to targets with only a moderate slowdown in output growth). Analysts point to the track recor d of the US economy .  Ever since the data on the Federal Funds rate are available from Q3:1954 , there have been ten occasions in which monetary  tightening has  caused a recession  in the US . On the other hand, not all episodes of tightening have ended in rec ession. In the present context, let us look at the  evidence available so far .  First,  revisions in GDP projections by major central banks and multilateral agencies in June 2022 continue to indicate a loss of pace rather than a loss of level. Second, with f ront-loaded monetary policy actions underway, central banks may not face the need for prolonged actions that lead to recessions,  by historical experience. Third, with the labour participation rate still lower than pre -pandemic levels in US and UK, wage pre ssures are rising but not yet overheated. Finally, food and fuel price pressures are essentially transitory and may ease sooner or later, taking out a large contributor to currently elevated inflation.  The evolving trends need close monitoring.   Historical Perspective  9. The current synchroni sed rise in inflation across economies  is not a maiden occurrence in modern economic history . Let us step back in time and recount what had happened during the inflation era of the 1970s . Amidst repeated supply shocks from oil  prices in 1973 and 1979 -80 and 5  weather -related  food shocks , countries were mired in stagflation with double digit inflation accompanying a rise in unemployment.   10. The experience of the 1970s  significantly changed the course of macroeconomic thinking.  Policymakers understood  that there is no permanent trade -off between inflation and output  \u2013 any attempt to increase output at the cost of tolerating higher inflation will inevitably lead to high and rising inflation  and unhinging of  inflation expectations without any durable output gains. This realisation  led to a growing focus on keeping  inflation expectations well -anchored  and strengthening of monetary policy frameworks, including adoption of flexible inflation targetin g. During the subsequent period , inflation and inflation volatility declined remarkably, inflation expectations gradually aligned with the target  across economies , and the global economy expanded on a steady path, leading to an era described as the Great Moderation  (Bernanke, 2004)2. Inflation spikes also became  short -lived, given well anchored inflation expectations. While improved monetary policy frameworks did play an important role, the concomitant rise of rule -based fiscal policies backed by fiscal responsibility legislations, gains in productivity and technology, deepening of financial system s and globali sation also helped in moderating  inflation.   Inflation and the Conduct of Mone tary Policy in India  11. The  history of inflation in India since independence  (1947)  reveals  that incidents of high and volatile inflation mainly emanated from droughts ;  wars ; trends in minimum support prices  (MSPs); global crude oil price shocks;  large fiscal deficits  and their monetisation ; and sharp exchange                                                            2 Ben S. Bernanke (2004) , \u201cThe Great Moderation\u201d , Remarks at the meetings of the Eastern Economic Association, Washington, DC February 20.  6  rate movements. Overall, while there were sporadic occurrences of high inflation, the Indian economy did not encounter episodes of hyperinflation.   12. The Gulf War of 1991 \u2013 which resulted in a spike in international crude prices and consequent increase in domestic administered prices \u2013  was a major episode of imported inflation. In addition, the balance of payments (BoP) crisis of 1991 led to sharp exchange rate devaluation, which translated into increased cost -push pressures on import sensitive products. Beginning the second half of the 1990s, the improvement in fiscal -monetary interface and reforms in the Government securities market provided monetary po licy the operational  flexibility to deliver on its price stability and growth objectives.   13. The next major inflation shock was in the post -GFC period when  monsoon failure, high increase in MSPs, and escalating global commodity prices triggered inflationary  pressures, which were reinforced by demand pull from a quick rebound in domestic growth from monetary and fiscal stimulus measures. Monetary policy normalisation at that time was gradual, given the considerations of economic recovery.  With signs of inflationary pressures getting entrenched, monetary policy moved to an aggressive tightening mode in 2011. By 2013, macro-imbalances began to build up and got reflected in high and persistent inflation, growth slowdown and a deteriorating external sector. In th is scenario, the taper tantrum of 2013 plunged the economy into severe external sector stress and macro- financial vulnerabilities. These developments set in motion the process towards the formal adoption of a flexible inflation targeting (FIT) framework for monetary policy in June 2016.   7  14. What followed was a period of low and stable inflation  till the COVID shock . The average CPI inflation between September 2016 and February 2020 was 3.9 per cent and was closely aligned with the inflation target of 4 per cent .   Recent Phase  15. The onset of the pandemic in early 2020 saw global commodity prices crash  as restrictions and stringent lockdowns  were expected to lead to a collapse of aggregate demand.  There were, however , two occasions  during the calendar years 2020 and 2021 when inflation hovered above  6.0 per cent . First, from June till  November 2020  when the  surge in inflation was trigged by a series of adverse transitory supply side shocks ranging from increase in retail margins  in food items ; supply chain and logistics bottlenecks ; unseasonal rains and result ant crop damage ; and the domestic spillovers from the sharp rise in international prices of edible oils. In the following period, that is from December 2020 to April 2021 , inflation moved closer to the target rate of 4 per cent as much of the transitory price shocks waned . The easing of inflationary pressures, however, was short -lived as India experienced a devastating second wave of COVID -19 during April- June 2021 which  triggered localised lockdowns, renewed supply chain disruptions and rising retail margins . This pushed inflation above 6.0 per cent during May -June 2021 . The inflation pressures were reinforced by adverse spillovers from rising global commodity prices.   16. The inflationary pressures occurred even as there was unprecedented damage inflicted  by the pandemic  on economic activity \u2013  real GDP contracted by a humungous 23.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2020 -21 and by as much as 6.6 per cent in the full  financia l year  2020 -21. Against this backdrop, the monetary policy committee (MPC) of the RBI 8  maintained status quo  on rates during the pandemic despite inflation intermittently breaching the upper tolerance band. The MPC decided to look through the higher inflation print to allow  the nascent recovery to get entrenched \u2013 both by retaining the accommodative stance of policy and by refraining from hi king the policy rate. Since the inflationary episode lacked any significant demand- pull component, any policy tightening at that juncture would have been detrimental to growth and extracted heavy social costs without being effective in containing  inflation  pressures. This was in consonance with the flexibility embedded in our flexible inflation targeting framework , according to which the primary objective of the monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth.   17. In early 2022 , inflation was expected to moderate significantly to the target rate of 4 per cent by Q3:2022-23, with a projected average inflation rate of 4.5 per cent for 2022-23 . This assessment was  based on an anticipated normalisation of supply chains , the gradual ebbing of COVID -19 infections  and a normal monsoon. The median inflation projection from the Survey of Professional Forecasters  at 5.0  per cent for 2022 -23 was also quite benign.  This narrative was, however, completely overtaken by the war in Europe since end -February , which led to a sharp spike in global crude oil and other commodity prices.  Global food prices reached a historical high in March and their effects were felt in edible oil, feed cost and domestic wheat prices. The loss of Rabi wheat production  due to an unprecedented heat wave put further pressures on wheat prices. Cost -push pressures were also aggravated by supply chain and logistics bottlenecks due to the war and sanctions.   9  18.  Taking stock of the evolving developments  and with inflation pressures getting generalised, the MPC in its April and June meetings revised the projection of inflation for 2022-23 in two stages to 6.7 per cent. About three- fourths of the revision in June was on account of geopolitical spillovers  to food prices . The MPC also decided to increase the policy  repo rate by 40 bps and 50 bps in May and June , respectively . This was on top of the 40 bps effective rate hike through  the introduction of the  Standing Deposit Facility ( SDF)  at 3.75 per cent, which resulted in a concomitant increase in the weighted average call rate (WACR), compared  to the liquidity absorption rate under the fixed rate reverse repo regime.  The WACR, as you would be aware, is the operating target of monetary policy. During this period , i.e., April to June 2022, the MPC also changed its stance to withdrawal  of accommodation.   19. Overall, at this point of time, with the supply  outlook  appearing favourable and several high frequency indicators pointing to resilience of the recovery in the first quarter (April -June) of 2022-23, our current assessment is that inflation  may ease gradually in the second half of 2022 -23, precluding  the chances of a hard landing in India .  Approach to Monetary Policy in Crisis Times  20. A closer look at our journey through the two black swan events of COVID -19 and the geopolitical crisis in Europe would bring out certain distinct contours of our approach in these turbulent times. Our overarching objective was to safeguard the economy and preserve financial stability. Our endeavour has been to ensure a soft landing. These objectives continue to guide our actions  even today and it will continue to be so in future. I would now  like to  touch upon a few aspects  of our approach.   10  Communication in Turbulent Times 21. For monetary policy to be effective  in such turbulent and uncertain  times, communicati on of monetary policy objectives, actions and stance with prescience and clarity  assumes even greater importance. Monetary policy is ultimately about managing expectations of various economic agents \u2013 from households to financial markets. In this context, over the past three years, we backed our actions with clear forward guidance and  tweaked it as necessary with reference to the evolving circumstances . For instance , our forward guidance was initially state -based . But, i n the second half of 2020 -21, there were undue market concerns that the accommodative monetary policy stance might have to be reversed in the face of elevated inflation . To quell such disruptive forces  and their possible negative effects on our accommodative stance, we supplemented our state -based guidance with time -contingent guidance by stating our intent to continue \u201c with the accommodative stance of monetary policy as long as necessary \u2013 at least during the current financial year and into the next year ...\u201d. Inflation eased in the second half of 2020-21 itself in line with our assessment as supply side pressures abated . The time -based element of the guidance did help to anchor market expectations and moderate undue expectations building up at that time of a possible reversal of the monetary policy stance.   22. We have actively engaged in two -way communications \u2013 we consult actively with various stakeholders in the run up to the bi -monthly MPC meetings; we hold  wide ranging press conferences after the bi -monthly meetings to put forward our viewpoints clearly and clarify the issues raised by the media and analysts. We back up this with speeches and media interviews. The release of the minutes after 14 days of the  MPC meeting and individual statements of the members, including my statement, have 11  further strengthened our communication. A  range of statutory and staff publications  on key analytical aspects of monetary economics are an additional avenue of our forward -looking communication .   23. My regular statements to announce the MPC decision and its rationale have becom e an integral element of the institutional edifice of the RBI\u2019s crisis time response. These statements provide forward guidance to financial markets on the RBI\u2019s liquidity stance and have ensured orderly conditions in the financial markets , even amidst the  pandemic and war  related stress. In August 6, 2021 statement, I emphasised that the RBI remains in \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d mode, with a readiness to deploy all its policy levers - monetary, prudential or regulatory . These words engendered calm and confidence in the markets.   Prudence as the Cornerstone of our A pproach  24. During this entire period,  we had gone beyond the rule book and we had explicitly said so. But we remained prudent at all times. For example,  when we announced the government securities acquisition programme (G-SAP) in April 2021 , we were going beyond the RBI\u2019s lexicon; but we discontinued it after six months when liquidity was assessed to be amply surplus. By doing so, we were well ahead of th e major central banks in ceasing fresh asset purchases.  Similarly, we refrained throughout the pandemic period from primary financing or direct monetisation of the government\u2019s fiscal deficit, notwithstanding the clamour from various expert opinions at that time. Prudence also underlined our approach when we refrained from diluting the quality of the RBI\u2019s balance sheet by strictly confi ning our liquidity injection measures to government securities as collateral. Further, the Resolution Framework s for COVID -19 related stressed assets were not open ended , but were subject to certain financial 12  and operational parameters to be achieved as part of the resolution process.    Convention al, Unconventional and I nnovative Measures  25. As I said a little while ago, we have often gone beyond the rule -book over the past 2 -3 years , combining conventional, unconventional and innovative measures . For instance , we made active use of the Liquidity Adjustment Facility ( LAF) corridor as an instrument of policy, first through large reduction s in the reverse repo rate in March  and April 2020. Consequently, the  money market rates went even below the policy rate . Another such example was in April 2022 with the institution of the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) at 40 basis points above the fixed rate reverse repo to begin the process of withdrawal of the accommodati ve stance. There are o ther such examples of being nimble -footed  like the advance ment  of MPC meetings , the off-cycle MPC meeting s, etc.   Navigating the Liquidity \u2018Chakravyuh\u20193  26. Our liquidity injection measures involved a prudent and calibrated expansion of the RBI\u2019s balance sheet. Our measures were targeted as per requirement and reflected a hands -on approach. These would include the targeted long term repo operations (TLTROs); special liquidity windows to suppo rt contact-intensive sectors severely hit by the pandemic; reduction in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) for a limited and pre-specified period ; and a few other measures. We had explicit sunset clauses for most of our liquidity injection measures during the pa ndemic which allowed us to unwind liquidity in a predictable manner and anchor market expectations. By building in the exit strategy at the time of                                                            3 Chakravyuh  : a military formation  used to surround enemies, depicted in the Indian  epic Mahabharata. It resembles a  labyrinth  of multiple  defensive walls , from which coming out is very difficult and known only to a handful of very skilled warriors .  13  injection, we were able to pull out significant part of the liquidity when it was no longer required.   27. We s tarted rebalancing of liquidity as early as January 2021 through the reintroduction of variable rate reverse repos  (VRRR)  to shift liquidity from the overnight fixed rate window towards longer tenors at variable rates . This helped in push ing market rates upwards in a gradual and orderly manner . This is an example of what I would call a silent action, preparing and guiding the markets in advance.   Concluding Observations  28. The benefits of globalisation come with certain risks and challenges.  Shocks to prices of food, energy, commodities and critical inputs are transmitted across the world through complex supply chains. This was evident during the pandemic, and more so after the conflict in Europ e erupted, with global shocks playing a dominant r ole in domestic inflation dynamics. These global factors present difficult policy trade -offs between price stability and stabilising economic activity, especially when the economy is recuperating from repeated shocks. They add to the macroeconomic and financial stability challenges from volatile capital flows in a financially globali sed world.  In fact, recent developments call for greater recognition of global factors in domestic inflation dynamics and macroeconomic developments which underscore the need for enhanced policy coordination and dialogue among countries to achieve better outcomes.   29.  The insurance against such inevitable global shocks ultimately is built on  sound economic fundamentals, strong institutions and smart policies. Price stability is key to maintaining macroeconomic and financial 14  stability. In a broader sense, inflation is a  measure of the trust and confidence that the public repose in the economic institutions of a country. While factors beyond our control may affect inflation in the short run , its trajectory over the medium -term is determined by monetary policy. Therefore, monetary policy must take timely actions to anchor inflation and inflation expectations so as to place the economy on a strong and sustainable growth pedestal. We will continue to calibrate our policies with the overarching goal of preserving and fostering  macroeconomic stability. In this endeavour, we will remain flexible in our approach while being cogent  and transparent in our communication. If history is any guide, I am optimistic that our actions will  usher in a new era of prosperity in the years ahead.   Thank you.    ", "5 Sep 22 FM.pdf": "1  Financial Market Reforms : Approach and Expectations  Address by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor, Reserve Bank of India  at FIMMDA Annual E vent, September 0 5, 2022  1. I am happy to be part of this FIMMDA1 event today. I take this opportunity to place on record the RBI\u2019s appreciation of the key role played by FIMMDA in the development of financial markets in India.  2. In my address this evening, I propose to reflect upon some recent financial market developments and our efforts to navigate through them in the prevailing  global and domestic environment. I shall then touch upon some  of our recent initiatives for the development of domestic financial markets  and then go on to conclude by expressing our  expectations from market participants and market bodies in the way ahead.  Recent Financial Market Turmoil  3. The recent commentary from the US Fed at Jackson Hole on the future trajectory of US monetary policy has infused substantial volatility into global financial markets, with large spillovers and knock -on effects on emerging market economies (EMEs).  This episode is yet another demonstration of the point made in my media interview on August 23, 2022 that while forward guidance can be a useful pol icy instrument in an accommodative monetary policy phase, it can be quite difficult to provide coherent and consistent guidance in a tightening cycle. The difficulty gets further compounded in the current environment of high uncertainty. Such forward guidance may even have destabili sing                                                             1 Fixed Income Money Market a nd Derivatives Association o f India  2  effects on financial markets , especially if the subsequent policy actions are at variance with earlier pronouncements . Central bank communication in the current context has thus become even more challenging than the actual policy actions. Notably, however, financial markets in India have recovered from the lows that they fell to in the immediate aftermath of the Jackson Hole event.  4. In this turbulent global environment, the resilience exhibited by Indian financial markets reflects the robust macroeconomic fundamentals of the economy, and the proactive and strategic policy interventions to mitigate the impact of the two blac k swan events that have occurred in quick succession \u2013  the COVID -19 pandemic and the war in Europe .  5. Experience tells us that markets  often tend to overreact to new information,  which also amplifies volatility. Especially in times such as now, when geopoli tical tensions and synchroni sed monetary policy tightening come together, overshooting often precedes subsequent realignment with the underlying fundamentals. Hence, it is useful to take stock of India\u2019s macroeconomic fundamentals and buffers , and assess t hem in the current and evolving conditions. First, India is widely perceived to be among the fastest growing major economies  in the world in 20222, when the other major economies may encounter recession or considerable moderation in their growth momentum. The favorable growth differential of India provides confidence to investors. This is amply reflected in the surge of portfolio flows into India since July 2022. Inflows in August alone at US$  7.5 billion are more than 1 6                                                             2 World Economic Outlook Update, July 2022, IMF.  3  times the net inflows in July. Second, the recent softening of commodity prices and supply chain pressures have  eased the terms of trade shock that India faced in the aftermath of the pandemic and the war. With the consequent easing of imported inflation pressures, India\u2019s CPI inflation  has peaked in April 2022. Further, t he average Indian basket crude price in August at USD 97 .4 per barrel has turned out to be lower than what we had assumed for the full year -  USD 105 per barrel - in the monetary policy r esolution  of August 5 . In fact, India\u2019s inflation is lower than a large number of its trading partners. Third, the shift in the commodity price outlook is also altering the assessment of India\u2019s current account deficit in 2022- 23, which is now expected to remain well within sustainable levels. Fourth, at a time when food security is threatened the world over by shortage s and soaring prices, India\u2019s large buffer stocks of food grains supplement domestic supply and assure food security domestically. Fifth, In dia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves of US$ 561 billion (as on August 26) provide a cushion against external shocks,  as is being demonstrated on a day -to-day basis. Moreover, the reserves are also reinforced by forward assets. Sixth, the health of our banking s ystem is sound . It is well capitalised and well provisioned , with improved asset quality. This constitutes a key pillar of financial stability  and is expected to provide positive spillovers for the financial markets.   6. Reflecting these fundamental factors,  the Indian rupee has moved in an orderly manner in the current financial year so far. It has held its own in a world of sharp depreciation across other EME and AE currencies.  While the US dollar has appreciated by 11. 8 per cent during the current financia l year so far, the INR has depreciated by 5.1 per cent, which is among the lowest in the world. The RBI is in the market 4  on a regular basis, providing liquidity and confidence so as to facilitate its smooth and normal functioning.  7. Exchange rate stability is an intrinsic element of our overall macroeconomic and financial stability. Our endeavo ur amidst the extraordinary events unfolding globally on an ongoing basis has been to anchor expectations and allow the exchange rate to reflect the fundamentals rathe r than overshoot. Avoiding undue and excessive volatility is a desirable policy objective for all stakeholders , while reaping the benefits of a market determined exchange rate regime.   8. Price stability provides the anchor for exchange rate stability in the medium -run. The flexible inflation targeting (FIT) regime provides credibility to the RBI\u2019s monetary policy mandate of assigning priority to   containing inflation and keeping inflation expectations anchored while keeping in mind the objective of growth. While the incoming monthly inflation prints in the near- term could be bumpy, we expect it to moderate in the second half of 2022 -23, and then move within the tolerance band in Q4 and then even lower in Q1:2023- 24. Response to the Pandemic and the War in Eu rope  9. In response to the pandemic,  as you are well aware,  the RBI deployed conventional and unconventional monetary policy tools. The financing conditions were kept easy. Normal functioning of various segments of the financial market was ensured. Our communications and forward guidance provided the much -needed clarity and confidence to the markets \u2013  both financial and non- financial.  5  10. As we adapted to the pandemic , the policy approach has been gradually normalised. Even as the Indian economy was recovering from the pandemic, it faced a setback from the war in Europe , which caused fresh supply disruptions and accentuated the earlier ones. Inflation became globalized. Consequently, t he response from Central banks has been aggressive leading to synchronized monetary tightening across the world. In India, t he MPC re -prioritised  price stability as the foremost objective of monetary policy and began a process of withdrawal of accommodation.  11. Going forward, our monetary policy will remain watchful, nimble -footed and calibrated in order to ensure price stability while supporting growth. The RBI remains committed to support the market with two- way operations, as warranted, in line with the revised liquidity management framework . The RBI will also strive to ensure stable money market conditions, the smooth conduct of the primary auctions in G-secs and facilitate the orderly evolution of the yield curve.  Reforms in Regulatory Framework and Financial  Markets  12. In spite of the two black swan events that have dominated the recent discourse, the RBI has steadfastly persevered with regulatory reforms aimed at the development of the domestic financial  markets . Our approach is based on the principle of adapting to the needs of a moderni sing financial market as it integrates with the rest of the world.   13. Let me touch upon on some of the regulatory changes  which have taken place during the last three years . The orderly development of the sovereign yield curve needs significant market liquidity at important benchmark tenor points  and supply of G -Secs of various tenors to 6  diverse class of market partic ipants matching with their investment requirements . To this end , the Benchmark Security Issuance Strategy was introduced during 2020- 21 under which government securities (g-secs) of specific benchmark tenor s of 2, 5, 10, 14, 30 and 40 -years are issued.  This year, g- secs with a 7- year tenor have also been introduced  after market consultation.   14. Issuance of green bonds provides a strong signal of a country\u2019s commitment to a low -carbon economy . It also h elps in bringing down the cost of capital for green pr ojects. Following  the announcement in the Union Budget for 2022- 23, the Government and the RBI are putting in place a framework for issuance of Sovereign Green Bonds,  in line with global  standards.  15. As part of our continuing efforts to increase retail participation in G-secs, the \u2018 RBI Retail Direct Scheme\u2019 was launched in November 2021 to facilitate individual investors to conveniently invest in G-secs, state development loans (SDL s) and sovereign gold bonds. Furthe r, to ensure liquidity to the retail investor, t he \u201cRetail Direct Scheme - Market Making \u201d was notified on January 04, 2022 . The scheme requires primary dealers to respond to buy/sell requests from the retail investors throughout market hours.  16. The RBI has continuously engaged in ensuring state -of-the-art infrastructure for trading, settlement  and timely dissemination of information  in the g -sec market . An important initiative in this context is the introduction of the Request for Quote (RFQ) dealing mod e on NDS -OM in October 2020. The RFQ mode aims to enable market 7  participants to negotiate trades on the NDS -OM platform itself  for better price discovery . 17. Derivative markets play an important role in allowing entities to hedge their risks  and improv ing liquidity for the underlying product.  Several measures have been taken to rationalise  the regulatory framework for forex, credit and interest rate derivative markets . Principle -based regime s have been implemented in place of prescriptive regulations  in a bid to provide greater flexibility and operational freedom to mar ket participants . Access of non -residents to these markets has been eased.  The access of i nstitutional users to the markets has been facilitated both for hedging and for expressing their views on market movements.  18. With these reform measures , product due diligence assumes greater importance. It would  ensur e that market -makers offer products that match the requirement of the users and avoid exposing their clients to excessive risk.  Considering the recent changes in the regulations relating to OTC derivatives and in line with international standards, a regulatory framework for m arket -makers in OTC d erivatives3 has been put in place to ensure high standards of governance, risk m anagement and conduct by market makers.  19. We have also continued our efforts towards integrating domestic and offshore INR markets .  Banks in India with operative IFSC Banking Units were permitted to access the offshore non- deliverable rupee derivative market in 2020.  To facilitate integration of offshore and                                                             3 Master Direction \u2013 Reserve Bank of India (Market Maker in OTC Derivatives) Directions, 2021 dated September 16, 2021 (https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Notification.aspx?Id=12163&fn=6&Mode=0)  8  onshore market s for Overnight Indexed Swaps (OIS) \u2013 the most active rupee interest rate derivative in the domestic market \u2013  Banks in India and standalone primary dealers ( SPDs ) have been permitted to undertake  settlement of OIS transactions  with non -residents  in foreign currency .  20. Broadly, the recent regulatory and institutional reforms have been aimed at enabling the domestic financial markets to face the challenges of the next decade. Cutting across market segments, these reforms seek to usher in a simplified, principle- based regulatory framew ork that seeks to broadbase markets by easing access, enhancing participation, facilitating innovation, protecting users and promoting fair conduct.  Market Participants and Market Bodies  as Reform Partners  21. It is important to note that achievement of the desired outcomes  from the significant changes in the regulatory framework for financial market and its infrastructure is contingent upon market participants taking forward the reform agenda. It is heartening to see the market participants ris ing to the occasion and partnering  with the Reserve Bank to meet the challenges of recent years. One such instance was the smooth completion of the government borrowing programme, despite the increased issuances in the last two years.  22. Similarly, t he move to wards  normalisation of liquidity conditions in the market has also taken place without any disruption. In response to changes in regulation, we are seeing our banks becoming active and visible in global markets and coming up with new products to meet the hedging  needs of the real sector. The transition away from LIBOR  has also been achieved with relative smooth ness . Of course, the efforts 9  towards complete transition need to continue as we approach the deadline for the cessation of all US dollar LIBOR settings less than a year away.  In all of these areas , market bodies  such as the FIMMDA , PDAI4, FEDAI5 and the Indian Banks Association (IBA)  have continued to play an important role in acting as bridges  between the market participants and the regulator, proactively conveying the views of the market and providing timely inputs for policy making.  Expectations from Market Participants  23. There are, however, some areas where performance of market participants  can improve further. One area has been the delivery of services to the small / retail customers. While there has been a steady increase in the quantum of secondary market trades under the RBI Retail Direct Scheme, there remains considerable scope for improvement in ensu ring liquidity for the retail investors throughout market hours  on the NDS -OM platform . We continue to get representations from customers - particularly, those undertaking forex transactions with small ticket sizes  - about fair pricing of forex products . A research study by some officers in th e RBI found empirical evidence of the presence of considerable price discrimination in the OTC currency derivatives market. The services provided by banks on the FX -Retail platform need special attention . The response time and onboarding of customers on the platform can be faster.  24. The revised product regulations in OTC derivative markets now permit market -makers to deal in derivative products of varying                                                             4 Primary Dealers Association of India (PDAI)  5 Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India ( FEDAI)  10  complexity  and to offer these products only to non -retail /institutional  customers who have the ability to handle the risks associated with such products . It has been reassuring to note that market participants  and users have been taking a prudent approach in the use of complex products . The valuation and the risk management s ystems of the market -maker s may need to be continually updated. Customers also need to be made aware of the unique risks associated with these product s.  25. The recent reform measures have facilitated greater linkages of  the domestic market with the global markets . As the footprints of banks in India increase in the offshore market s, it is expected that price discovery of rupee products will also consolidate in the onshore market . To realise this potential, banks need to put in place adequate  supporting infrastructure backed by expertise in risk management . More so, because i ntegrated financial markets can also facilitate faster propagation of shocks which require appropriate risk management processes.  Conclusion  26. Let me now concl ude by stating that market development ultimately is a shared goal of both the regulator and the market participants. The RBI has taken steps towards liberali sing markets, removing barriers and putting in place a facilitative regulatory framework. Adoption of  new product s requires participation from market participants in terms of providing liquidity, contributing to price determination and easing operational constraints.  It is upon the market participants to take the baton forward to develop the market and offer innovative financial 11  products to a broader set of clients . The RBI will remain constantly engaged with the market bodies and participants. Together, we should remain future ready  at all times . I firmly believe that we can do this.  I wish FIMMDA all success in its  future endeavours and look forward to our continued partnership.  Thank you.

I have been a inaugural speaker at the FE DAI conferences during past few years, in person or in absentia  and it is always a challenge to se lect an appropriate topic in line with the overall theme of the conference. I fe lt really relieved that the theme for this Conference attempts to capture a broade r canvas, revolving around long-run growth cycles. I hope the deliberations enable us  to focus more closely on the relationship between the cart and the horse  so that foreign exchange flows do support growth.  3. There are several ways in which capital flow s and growth are related. First, growth expectations drive capital flows. In tu rn, capital flows accelerate growth. If capital flows are well absorbed by the real econom y and do not generate macro-economic or financial instabilities, they stay. Such cap ital flows augment gr owth over the long-run and may help income levels in developi ng economies converge towards the income levels in advanced economies. Second, capit al is likely to be attracted towards countries with high productivity growth a nd higher marginal productivity of capital. However, in practice this is found to be not  necessarily true. Thir d, what is generally missed is the fact that it is not just the ne t capital flows that drive growth, but also the gross capital flows contribute to growth. Gr oss capital flows contribute immensely to diffusion of technology a nd international knowledge flows. Fourth growth \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a01\u00a0Keynote Address at the Annual Conference of th e Foreign Exchange Dealers\u2019 Association of India (FEDAI) on February 18, 2011 at Thimpu \u00a02\u00a0\u00a0augmentation can also take place becau se capital flows enforce macro-economic discipline and force firms to improve govern ance. However, the impact of capital flows on growth ultimately depends on their being stable and less  volatile. Durable capital flows bring durable growth, while non-durable and volatile capital flows not only bring about non-durable growth but also  large output losses in cases of currency or banking crisis. This howev er does not make a case for capital controls as in a globalised world capital account liberalisat ion is seen as a plus-sum game.  4. According to IMF's World Economic Outlook (October 2010), private financial flows to EMEs are projected to increase to US D 339.6 billion in 2010 as  compared to US 234.8 billion in 2009 accounted for mainly by equity flows. Growth in bank lending, after the rebound since the crisis lows, is expected to slow down. Going further, however, the improved growth scenario in developed markets (DM) and the rising concerns regarding inflation in the EMs ha s created uncertainty in regard to the quantum of flows to EMEs. Global imbalances , which have been the driver of capital flows over the past several years,  are expected to continue.  5. Given the inherent uncertainties, most of th e capital recipient EMEs  are going to find it challenging to respond dyna mically. If the tide of global flows changes, it may not be easy to change policy gears swiftly though magnitude of impact would depend on the specific macroeconomic situation, particularly the current account position. Over a longer horizon, therefore, it makes sense to have a broad framework for capital account management from a macroprudential perspective.  6. It is this post-cr isis shift in regard to  the approach to capital  account that I intend to talk about today. Beyond the immediate imp act of capital flows on exchange rate dynamics, the procyclicality of such flows a nd implications for financial stability are being clearly recognised. In th is context, the underlining theme that I want to bring out is that irrespective of the stage of lib eralisation of capital account, there seems to be an imperative need for a framework for capital account management which gives the policymakers sufficient spac e and instruments to be able  to modulate policy to the different characteristics of capital flows. Not having such a framework only enhances the disruptive impact of sudden capital c ontrol measures when they are announced.   3\u00a0\u00a0Shift in the approach to capital account management  7. The recent crisis has clearly been a turning point in the world view on capital controls. The issue of regulation of capital flows has slowly but  steadily moved to the centrestage from earlier being confined to  the periphery of th e mainstream policy discourse. The hesitancy of policymakers at th e helm in discussing this openly earlier has given way to a welcome openness.   8. Even the Bretton Woods institutions have re visited their earlier approach on the issue of management of capital flows. There was a time in the nineties that, backed by the intellectual force of the \u2018Washington C onsensus\u2019, the IMF at one point was considering including liberal ization of international capital movements as a central purpose of the Fund. The subsequent crisis in  East Asia in 1997, however, halted such moves of the IMF.  9. It seems to have come full circle now. Th e experience of many EMEs during the crisis underlined the financial stability implicati ons of volatile capital flows. At the G-20 Seoul Summit in Nov 2010, the Leaders agreed \u201c to work on financial stability issues that are of particular interest to emerging market and de veloping economies and called on the FSB, IMF and World Bank to develop and report before the next Summit. These issues include the management  of foreign exchange risks by financial institutions corporations and households...........\u201d  10. A recent policy note prepared by the IMF Staff2 puts the issue of cross-border capital flows in perspective. It r ecognises the destabilising impact of capital floods and droughts particularly on emerging economies, no ting that volatile cap ital flows played a key role in the recent crisis, both in increasing vulnerabilities and in transmitting shocks across borders. Recently a group of more than 250 economists have written an open letter to the US Government, explaining the benign influences  of capital controls and stressing the need for the US to dilute  the capital control covenants in the U.S. trade and investment treaties. Increasin gly many EMEs are beginning to impose capital controls and regulations, both of the traditional kind such as reserve requirements, URR and restrictions on i nvestment in debt including minimum \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a02\u00a0\u201cThe Fund\u2019s role regarding cross-border capital flows \u201d, IMF, November, 2010 4\u00a0\u00a0investment period but also  more innovative ones such as prudential measures, administrative measures, tax measures and qua ntitative limits, particularly targeting the derivative positions held by banks. I ndeed, many of these derivatives were initially invented to avoid precisely regula tions on capital inflows or other types of financial activity.  11. The key elements of this shift have been the following: \u2022 Ex-ante  management of capital flows is now accepted as a legitimate instrument of macroeconomic policy a nd financial stability. Though exchange rate appreciation is still considered the preferred ex-post  policy option in dealing with inflows, intervention is now justified if there is major veering away of the currency from its fundamental value.  \u2022 The limitations of individual country-speci fic measures are being articulated.  The IMF policy note seeks to address the issue through development of rules of the game for global capital flow s and in fostering multilateral, non-discriminatory, approaches that look to the interest of both the originators and recipients of capital. Is such a framewor k possible? I am not sure but till then countries impacted by this would need to continue to find their answers.  \u2022 It is increasingly being r ecognised that it is gross flows that determine risk exposures and are therefore important fo r financial stability. Netting of cross-temporal flows does not capture the real  impact of gross capital flows on exchange rate as well as asset price impacts.   \u2022 Capital control measures are bei ng designed more innovatively for effectiveness. Derivative transactions are increasingly being specifically targeted and many countries are resorti ng to enhanced supervision and data reporting to monitor the build up of curre ncy positions in the books of banks.  \u2022 The issue of capital flows is getti ng factored in the macroprudential framework being envisaged for financial institutions globally.  Procyclicality of capital flows and of wholesale market  funding can engender vulnerabilities. Prudential measures to address asset market volatility such as risk weights, provisioning, LTV ratios, margin requi rements and the build up of foreign currency liabilities in the financial system  are also considered as legitimate instruments to respond to de stabilising capital flows.  5\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 There is greater recognition of the insu rance needs of countries. While it was commonly argued before the crisis that  many Asian countries were incurring avoidable costs in accumulating large fo reign currency reserves, it has been widely noted that countries with large reserves fared relatively well during the crisis. Forex reserves have provided se lf-insurance during th e global liquidity crisis. Those countries that built up precautionary reserve holding were able to avoid large depreciation in the \u201cPan ic of 2008\u201d (Obstfeld, Shambaug, and Taylor, 2009).  \u2022 The argument for compositional irre levance of capital flows stands questioned. A recent IMF paper3 has concluded that the appreciation effect of private flows differs by type  of flow. Portfolio investments, which are more volatile, have the highest appreciation effect, followed by FDI and bank loans. Since these flows are potentially related to an increase in productive capacity, the real appreciation associ ated with FDI and bank loan s is barely one-seventh of the real appreciation due  to portfolio investments. Private transfers (mainly remittances) are the flows that have the least appreciation effect. This may suggest that remittances are not procyclical.  12. The cross-country experience  of controls on inflows and outflows provides some conjectures for policy purposes. These are summarised below: \u2022 It is evident that while the controls on capital inflows  have proved somewhat effective in containing pressures on foreign exchange markets, the experiments with controls on outflows  by the EMEs, particularly in crisis situations did not help in alleviat ing the exchange market pressures. \u2022 While controls to limit short-term inflows could be helpful in specific circumstances, such restrictions in fo rce for longer-term entail costs. However, temporary uses of controls are more effective and can even improve the financial environment. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a03\u00a0Jean-Louis Combes, Tidiane Ki nda, and Patrick Plane: \u201c Capital Flows, Exchange Rate Flexibility, and the Real Exchange Rate \u201d, IMF Working Paper, 2011 \u00a06\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 It is important to recognize that neither  the use of capital controls is uniform nor the results are identical. In additi on, their impact can be subdued by global conditions. \u2022 In case of pressures arising out of capital outflows, the controls in the form of numerous restrictions on the banks\u2019 ex ternal transactions were not fully effective as they were circumvented in many instances. \u2022 Moreover, the various instruments of c ontrols provided only temporary relief or contained the initial pressures on fore x markets when there were internal or external imbalances ( i.e., high fiscal deficit, weakne sses in the financial sector, high current account deficit). \u2022 Offshore markets for the domestic currency ( e.g., NDF markets) proved to be an important source of speculation and in some instances control measures could not succeed.  \u2022 In case of crises countries, the instru ments deployed to control outflows were ultimately replaced by the abandonment of  exchange rate band/peg in favour of float. Indian context 13. The policy approach in India to the issu e of capital flows has evolved from the broader objective of maintaining financia l and macroeconomic stability and not merely addressing the singular variable of ex change rate. The salient elements of this framework have been: (i) an explicitly stated activ e capital account management framework,  based on the policy stance of encouraging non-de bt creating and long-term capital inflows and discouraging debt flows;  (ii) having the policy space to use multiple instruments - quantitative limits, price based measures as well as administrativ e measures, particularly for foreign currency borrowing by corporates; (iii) short term debt permitted only for trade transaction; (iv) avoiding the \u2018original si n\u2019 of excessive forei gn currency borrowings by domestic entities, particularly the sovereign; 7\u00a0\u00a0(v) prudential regulations to prevent excessive  dollarization of balance sheets of financial sector intermedia ries, particularly banks;  (vi) cautious approach to liability dollarisation by domestic entities and   (vii) significant liberalization of  permissible avenues for outward investments for domestic entities. Recent trends 14. During the past five years, like other Emerging Market Economies (EMEs), India has been experiencing consistently strong capital flows, ba rring the crisis year of 2008-09. During the crisis year of 2008-09, net capital flows plummeted to USD 6.8 (0.5 per cent of GDP) from USD 106.6 billion (8.7 per cent of GDP) in 2007- 08. The net capital flows again surged to USD 53.6 billion (4.1 per cent of GDP) during 2009-10.  During the first half of 2010-11 (April-September 2010), the net capital flows were  USD 36.7 billion, which was 59.6 per cent higher than the net flows during the same period of the previous year (USD 23.0 billion).  15. The latest trends in capital flows indicat e that the net capital flows during 2010-11 are expected to be  higher than in 2009-10. FII investment, ECBs and trade credit dominate capital flows with FIIs flows remaining as the ma jor driver of capital flows during the current year so far.  During the period up to February 4, 2011, the net FIIs flows stood at USD 29.6 billion as against USD 22.4 billion during the corresponding period of 2009-10. The ECBs registered during April-December 2010 amounted to USD 15.8 billion as against USD 13.8 billion during April-December 2009.

FCCBs have constituted a significant part of the ECBs raised during the last few years, except for the sudden decline in the immediate aftermath of the crisis.  Table 2: Issuance of FCCBs  (USD million)   Year Total FCCBs  Total ECB Share of FCCB to total ECBs (in per cent) 2004-05 470 11,490 8 2005-06 2402 17,175 28 2006-07 5,736 25,352 20 2007-08 5,854 30,959 20 2008-09 27 18,362 1 2009-10 3,274 21,678 15 2010-11* 1,265 15,994 8  19,028  100  17. However, with focus on capital flows on a net basis, it is often not realized that portfolio flows were US$174 billion a year ove r last three years on a gross basis, far outstripping FDI flows at US$37 billion a year. In gross term s, over the last five years (2005-06 to 2009-10) FII flows have accounted fo r 47% of the gross capital inflows to India as against 9% for FDI inflows. This of  course has more to do with the nature of these flows with a much larger churn fo r portfolio capital. Hi gh gross flows make economy more susceptible to su ch reversals and as such we need to continue to maintain adequate buffers. 18. In the current context, a high CAD has been  absorbing much of the capital flows in aggregate terms. The concerns, however, ar ise on account of the composition of flows coupled with lower order of reserves acc retion and faster increase in external liabilities.  19. The enhanced exposure to external liabilities  is reflected in the sharp increase in the ratio of external debt to foreign excha nge reserves from 89.1 per cent of GDP in 2008-09 to 99.1 per cent as at end June 2010. Moreover, the ratio of short-term debt to reserves has increased from 17.2 per cent to 21.0 per cent duri ng the same period. Another issue that may come up going forward relates to repayment of FCCBs. The 9\u00a0\u00a0redemption pressures on account of FCCBs  would start building up from 2010-11 and peak in the next coupl e of years till 2012-13.  Table 3: FCCBs redemption pro file (as on Decem ber 31, 2010) Year FCCBs due for redemption  (USD million) 2010-11 1,169.24 2011-12 3622.7 2012-13 3757.74 2013-14 828.11 2014-15 2451.85 2015-16 482.5 Beyond 2016 699 Total 13,011.14  20. The relaxation of buy-back guidelines and re financing has helped the corporates to better plan for the impending repayments. The le ssons of the crisis will hopefully lead to better management and accounting of  such liabilities by the corporates.  21. As is evident from the accretion to reserv es and given the current account deficit, unlike other central banks from emergi ng markets, RBI has been the least interventionist. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves (excluding valuation effects) increased by US$ 7.0 billion during the first half of 2010-1. Foreign exchange reserves as on January 14, 2011 stood at US$ 297.4 billion. Though it is recognized that foreign exchange reserves can only be partial antidote to capit al flow volatilities, they indeed work as comfort buffers during times of crisis.   Key issues and Road ahead 22. Going forward, the issue in ou r context is not really about the limited context of capital flows but a more fundamental one of the capital account management architecture which is respons ive to the needs of the r eal economy and maintaining financial stability. The issue of opening up of the capital account fully has become, so to speak, the last frontier in reforming the financial sector. In some quarters, the capital account constraint has come to be  perceived as impacting other elements, particularly the development of markets. However, what such arguments fail to recognise is that the macroeconomic fram ework is an intric ately inter-connected 10\u00a0\u00a0model with several cross-impact elements. One can\u2019t touch just one element without disturbing some other.   23. It thus becomes necessary to progress with liberalisation of different elements of the capital account within the overall context. We have been measuring our readiness in terms of certain metrics but these have proved to be contextually variable. The practical approach seems to be to move towards further liberalisation but retain the broad principles of the approach pursued h itherto. In this context, let me touch upon the key issues in  regard to major elements:   FDI flows  \u2022 FDI contributes to stable growth through transfer, diffu sion and spill-over effects and it is considered stable. Except for a few sectors the policy is liberal and investments can be made under the auto matic route. There have been some concerns on the dec lining FDI flows in the recent pa st though as stated earlier it has little to do with the regulatory framework  per se except in cer tain sectors.  The moderation in FDI inflows to India duri ng April-November 2010 has been driven by sectors such as construction, mining and business services. Certain structural  factors, if addressed expedi tiously, could raise the share of India in the projected FDI flows to EMEs in the near future. According to the IIF,  net FDI flows to EMEs are forecast to increase by 11 per cent in 2011.  In this context, it may need to be rec ognised that FEMA, in terms of its scope, is concerned only with the transactions, both capital and current account, and not with the economic activity per se .  FDI policy is not just a capital account issue but is linked to Government\u2019s regulatory policies governing sp ecific sectors that are much broader in nature. This too n eeds to be addresse d appropriately.    Portfolio flows  \u2022 The Report of the Committee on Fo reign Investment has recommended introducing a single cha nnel of foreign investments, QF I, for all foreign investors. While the regulations for various channe ls is well appreciated, the Committee has suggested opening up the QFI route to all foreign invest ors, includi ng individuals, subject to compliance with KYC requirements. The issue here is not merely 11\u00a0\u00a0access to stock markets but has much larger  implications. In e ffect, it would imply permitting all foreign residents to open accoun ts in India for their transactions and permitting them access to other market segments for their hedging requirements. The entire gamut of ramifications needs to be thought through carefully as this would result in full capit al account convertibiity. Investments in debt \u2022 The recent experience of many countries duri ng the crisis as well as the worsening external sector ratios for India preclude any case for further liberalising the debt route. However, one issue that has b een coming up regularly is that permitting foreign investment in domestic-currency denominated debt securities poses much less risks. While it is true that the currency risk in this case would be borne by foreign investors but it is equally true that the impact-risks of \u2018floods and droughts\u2019 would be similar. In fact, this  route would provide a channel for taking currency views as well. When currency risks are hedged, in effect the currency risk is transferred to domesti c financial system/entities.  Having a dominant investor class in the s hort term segment, susceptible to sudden stops and reversals, is clearly a risk  from macreconomic perspective. As illustrated by the chart below, FIIs have demonstrated a clear preference for short term tenors, with 40% each of the investment in government and corporate debt in tenors up to one year.  9%14%40%91%96%98%98%100%19%30%40%52%56%90%100%100%0%20%40%60%80%100%120%\u20101,000\u00a02,000\u00a03,000\u00a04,000\u00a05,000\u00a06,000\u00a07,000\u00a08,000\u00a0Up\u00a0to\u00a03\u00a0months 3 \u00a0months\u00a0\u20106\u00a0months6\u00a0months\u20101\u00a0year 1 \u00a0year\u00a0\u20103\u00a0years 3 \u00a0years\u00a0\u20105\u00a0years 5 \u00a0years\u00a0\u201010\u00a0years Above \u00a010\u00a0years Open \u00a0ended\u00a0Debt\u00a0MFsCummulative \u00a0invesment \u00a0percentageAmount\u00a0invested\u00a0(USD\u00a0Million)Maturity \u00a0BucketsMaturity \u00a0Profile\u00a0of\u00a0FII\u00a0Debt\u00a0InvestmentCorporateDebtGovernment \u00a0Securities Corporate \u00a0Debt(Cummulative \u00a0%\u00a0age)Government \u00a0Securities(Cummulative \u00a0%\u00a0age) 12\u00a0\u00a0The time honoured principles that underlie  opening up of debt markets to foreign investment are convergence in nominal a nd real interest ra tes on sustainable basis, low debt/GDP ratio and low fiscal  deficit to GDP ratios on a consistent basis. In case of sovereign borro wing, given the huge market borrowing requirements, there will be increased  susceptibility to global market developments and rating changes if there is increased participation of foreign investors. In the recent market turmoil, while the private sector did feel the adverse impact of worsening global cr edit conditions, the sovereign borrowing program was largely unaffected from  direct impact on this count.  Outflows  \u2022 The regime for outward flows by individuals , mutual funds as well as corporates, has been significantly liberalised over th e years.  The most visible manifestation of this policy has been the increasi ng cross-border acquisitions by Indian companies (Table 2).  Table 4: Outward FDI from India  (USD MIO) Year  Equity  Loan  Guarantee Issued  Total  2007-08 11291.92 2718.88 6959.97 20970.76 2008-09 10730..00 3313.86 3104.87 17148.74 2009-10 6738.85 3627.19 7603.79 17969.83 2010-11 ( till 17.02.2011)  8445.53 6609.73 25233.16 40288.42  Liberalising outward flows may not be a so lution to offset large portfolio inflows as is often recommended. The modus ope randi of overseas acquisitions is to undertake acquisitions through SPVs ove rseas. The funding is often arranged through overseas banks  backed  either by shares or asse ts of the target company and/or guarantees by the I ndian parent. The act ual outflow in the form of equity and loans is therefore not e quivalent to the actual value of the deals. Similarly, we have allowed mutual funds to invest  upto USD 8 billion overseas; only around USD 1 billion of this limit has been used. Such outflows may potentially take place at inopportune times from a systemic perspective. It this becomes 13\u00a0\u00a0imperative from a financial stability perspe ctive to have some prudential limits in place. Access to financial markets  \u2022 One of the key arguments favouring a more open capital account has been the attendant benefits it brings to the development of domestic markets. It was believed that free capital flows into the financial markets are necessary for efficient allocation of resources and for completion of markets by providing more liquidity. The potency of this argument has at  least partly been dented by the crisis which has demonstrated that pursuit of development of financial markets per se  cannot be an end in itself. \u2022 However, trying to balance all object ives does bring its own challenges for policymaking. It has been argued that in  today\u2019s financial world of complex derivatives, it is really not possible to have restrictive policies for flow of capital. The significant increase in the NDF volumes  involving INR is a case in point. The recent BIS Triennial Survey was pretty rev ealing in this regard. From a regulatory perspective, the real issue is the impact of this market on the onshore markets.  Our preliminary estimates have not been able to establish a causal relationship between the NDF and onshore markets but  going by the experience of other countries, the NDF market can indeed be a source of vulnerability. It does raise certain issues particularly regarding the nature of operations of banks as well as corporates having cross-border presence which may need to be looked into. Recently, there were reports that Korea ha s a similar audit of some overseas banks over trading in currency derivatives whic h are suspected of being \u201cspeculative moves\u201d.    It is often suggested that the way to d eal with the NDF market is to bring it onshore. In other words allow non-deliverable  forwards in the Indian market with free access to all non-residents which have the same impact as full capital account convertibility. This would essentially imply permitting non-residents access to domestic markets irrespective of whethe r they have underlying exposures to domestic markets or not. In other words allow them to trade foreign exchange involving the rupee as a sepa rate asset class. This coul d however lead to excessive 14\u00a0\u00a0volatility in foreign exchange markets. It  also has impact on other markets due to inter-linkages. Such liberalisation makes domestic markets very vulnerable to speculative attacks.  Is this opportune and advisable?    \u2022 Another related issue is that of use of Rupee for trade i nvoicing. It is argued that rupee invoicing may be a preferred opti on to help domestic exporters and importers to deal with currency volat ility. Even now, there are no regulatory restrictions coming in its way. The issues are twofold: first, the acceptability of rupee invoicing to the overseas trade count erparty; and two, the attractiveness of rupee for credit facilities. Acceptab ility may be increased by devising a mechanism to permit the overseas party to hedge its rupee exposures onshore. The RBI is willing to examine this and I woul d urge FEDAI to come up with feasible suggestions in this regard.  \u2022 The guidelines on CDS will be released shor tly. One of the issues is the access to this market for FIIs. RBI is examining th e suggestion to allow them to hedge the credit risk in India provided they  have invested in the underlying bonds.  Conclusion 24. The balance of costs and benefits of capita l flows for recipient countries has started getting reassessed in the afte rmath of the crisis. A simila r reassessment happened after the Asian crisis. Many studies have since c oncluded that the cross-country evidence on the growth benefits of capital-account  openness is inconclusive and lacks robustness. The present crisis, however, has le d to a shift in the approach to capital account from its narrow exchange rate impli cations and management of capital flows is now accepted as a legitimate instrume nt of growth, macroeconomic policy and financial stability. The role of forex reserv es in providing insurance is also recognized particularly since countries with large foreign exchange reserves were better positioned to weather the liquidity crisis.   25. India has now had some experience with the above model of a framework and the way forward seems to be continuing li beralisation within this framework.   26. To conclude, I would like to flag a few issues from a systemic perspective: 15\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 In an open economy like ours, there is n eed for greater rec ognition of currency and interest rate risks and the risk mana gement in banks and corporate firms need to gear up their risk management practices further in this area. It is our experience that a large number of cor porates still do not have well-designed risk management policies and practices to take care of vol atile exchange rate movements and give scant regard to tail risks. Th ere is also need for greater disclosure and adherence to  accounting standards for financial instruments. \u2022 There is also need to more comprehens ively qualitatively assess our external liabilities to also encompass liabilities of subsidiaries and branches of Indian financial institutions overseas, not in nominal terms but through a risk-based approach on the probability of recour se to parent bank liquidity support.  \u2022 Operations of foreign financial entities in domestic markets also have implications on capital account due to cross border f und flow and derivative positions. During the crisis period, funds were held abro ad temporarily to support parent bank liquidity. In India. there ar e prudential regulations on ba nks' recourse to overseas funding markets, including for foreign ba nks. More local fundi ng of local assets reduces systemic risk and helps to curb excessive ri sk taking and credit growth. 27. I hope that we will continue to have constructive engagement with FEDAI and I wish the conference all success.     ", "7 Jan 11 MP.pdf": "Dilemmas in Central Bank Communication Some Reflections Based on Recent Experience1 - Duvvuri Subbarao _________________________________________________________   First of all my thanks to Business Standard, and to my good friends T.N. Ninan and Sanjaya Baru, for inviting me to  deliver this second Business Standard Annual lecture. This is an honour to  which I attach a lot of value.  Central Bank Communication 2. As a part of my job, I accept several speaking commitments, and often I struggle to determine the topic for my speech and the key message I should be delivering. From that perspective, deciding  on a topic for this lecture has been relatively easy. I have chosen to speak on \u2018Dilemmas in Central Bank Communication\u2019, and that choice has been motivated by three reasons.   3. First, over two years into the job as  Governor of the Reserve Bank, I am still traversing a steep learni ng curve. I have learnt many things, and one of them is that communication of policy is as impor tant as the content of policy, and is oftentimes more challenging.   4. The second motivation for my choice of  the lecture topic comes from the experience of the recent crisis when centr al bankers around the world realized how                                                  1 Second Business Standard Annual Lecture delivered by Dr. Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India, at New Delhi on January 7, 2011. communication is critical to the effectiveness of crisis management policy. This bias towards openness actually reflects a remarkable shift in stance on the part of central bankers. As Liaquat Ahamad says in his best selling book, \u2018Lords of Finance\u2019, central bankers had previously be lieved that in times of crisis, it is prudent to obey the admonition of mothers,  across cultures, to their children: \u201cIf you can\u2019t say anything nice, don\u2019t say anyt hing at all.\u201d This follows from the recurring dilemma that central bankers f ace in times of panic. If you make an honest public statement, you end up feeding the frenzy. On the other hand, if you try to be reassuring, you have  to twist the truth. In re cent decades, however, central bankers have been increasingly persuaded th at even in times of stress, they are better off communicating rather than not communicating. The recent crisis reinforced this growing faith in communica tion as central bankers  realized, much to their relief, that keeping the public info rmed and updated actually reduced rather than exacerbated anxiety and panic.   5. The final reason for my choosing this topic is quite straight forward. This lecture is sponsored by a media house, and wh at better platform than this to share with the public some of the dilemmas and challenges we face in our communication strategy.  Domain of Communication 6. Central bank communication has been the subject matter of much intellectual discourse, but this has almo st always been in the context of communication of monetary policy. That is understandable because monetary  2policy is at the heart of central banking and also po ssibly because communication of monetary policy is arguably more  challenging than communicating other policies. In my lecture today though, I w ill speak about communication in a broader context - not just with reference to m onetary policy but also encompassing other dimensions of the Reserve Bank\u2019s mandate  such as, for example, regulation and supervision, currency management a nd external sector management.   Alan Greenspan - the Doyen of Communication! 7. It would be blasphemous to sp eak about central bank communication without first paying homage to  that doyen of cen tral bankers - Al an Greenspan. So let me get on with it.   8. Greenspan is notoriously famous for several things including for transforming central bank communication to  an art form. \u201cSince I\u2019ve become a central banker\u201d, he said in  1987, \u201cI\u2019ve learned to mumble with great incoherence. If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.\u201d   9. After nearly 15 years on the job, in  October 2001, Greenspan took a U turn saying that, \u201cOpenness is more than ju st useful in shaping better economic performance. Openness is an obligation of a central bank in a free and democratic society. Transparency of our activities is  the means by which we make ourselves accountable to our fellow citizens to aid th em in judging whether we are worthy of that task\u201d. Indeed, we owe it to Greenspa n, and perhaps his Delphic utterances, for generating much learned commentary on why central bank communication is important.   3Why is Central Bank Communication Important? 10. Over the last two decades, central banks have moved towards clearer communication and greater transparency. This has been driven by several motivations.   11. First and foremost, central banks have  realized that ope n and transparent communication enhances policy effectiv eness by way of achieving expected outcomes. This shift in cen tral bank theology from delib erate obscurity to greater transparency actually reflects a shift in th e theory of monetary policy. Up until the early 1990s, monetary policy was strongly influenced by Nobel Laureate Robert Lucas\u2019 argument that monetary policy affect ed real variables, like growth, only if the policy changes were unanticipated. This encouraged obscurity over openness and clarity. However, lost in the message was that monetary policy always affected nominal variables like inflation even if fully anticipate d. In the 1980s, two economists, also Nobel winners, Finn Kydla nd and Ed Prescott, argued that fully transparent rules rather than discretionary  policy changes were more efficient and credible. This was the beginning of the push towards rules over discretion and greater central bank transparency.   12. The most eloquent illust ration of this shift towa rds transparency is the change in the communication strategy of the US Fed. Hard as it might be to imagine from today\u2019s perspective, pr ior to 1994, the US Fed was not even announcing the target Fed Funds Rate; the ma rket was expected to infer the rate from the timing, sequencing and magnitude of its open market operations. In sharp  4contrast, today the Fed not only announces th e rate but also gives a clear indication of future policy trajectory. Indeed, it is standard prac tice for central banks these days to indicate the policy rates, the rati onale behind the policy action, the expected outcomes, and oftentimes to give forw ard guidance on future policy actions.   13. While communicating policy after  it is made is the standard mode of communication, central banks are also increasingly taking to communication before policy action. This again is a lesson of e xperience - that the market does not like unexpected news, and that surprises should be avoided unless surp rise is, in rare circumstances, part of the strategy itself . When the Fed announced last August that it would reinvest the proceeds of maturi ng securities purchased under the first phase of quantitative easing (QE1), ma rkets were unnerved. In contrast, the elaborate communication exercise that preceded the recent QE2 brought much clarity to the Fed action and delivered the expected \u2018announcement effect\u2019. QE2 has of course come in for ex tensive criticism, but that is  certainly not owing to any shortfall in communication.  14. We have had a similar experience at  the Reserve Bank. Both on the way up to the crisis and on the way down, we had to make several \u2018off-cycle\u2019 policy adjustments. There was wide agreement that these measures were expedient; nevertheless they did not go down well with the market because of the surprise element. This has prompted us to revise our communication strategy by introducing, with effect from Septem ber 2010, more structured scheduled mid-quarter reviews. While we have not surrendered our flexibility to take policy action  5as and when warranted, more frequent scheduling of policy reviews reduces the need for off-cycle action and thereby minimizes the surprise element.   15. Sometimes, communication, instead of being a vehicle for policy, can be the policy itself. Drawing yet again from the US experience during the crisis, the Fed realized that its  repeated announcemen t of keeping rates low \u2018for an extended period\u2019 led markets to reach a certain in ference on what \u2018extended period\u2019 could mean. In this context, some policy analysts  argued that a step that the Fed could consider was to modify th e language of the statement to communicate to investors that it anticipates keeping the target Federal Funds rate  low for a longer period than was currently priced in the markets. This, it was believed, would have eased financial conditions as was desired.  16. Communication can be a potentially pow erful tool for getting feedback when the implications and the impact of  proposed policy are uncertain. For example, the Reserve Bank has thrown open the issue of whether we should deregulate the interest rate on savings acc ounts, which incidental ly is one of the very few interest rates that remains admi nistered. There are persuasive arguments both for and against deregulating this. In th e Reserve Bank, we realized that this is, like all big decisions, a judgement call an d that we needed the \u2018wisdom of the crowds\u2019 in reaching a judgement. Discer ning people would no doubt have realized that eliciting views and feedback is now standard practice for most policy decisions of the Reserve Bank.    617. Yet another factor that has motivat ed central banks into placing larger emphasis on communication is their hard ea rned autonomy in the years before the crisis. Central banks have increasingl y embraced more open communication to counter the criticism that an autonom ous central bank comprising unelected decision makers was inconsistent with a democratic structure.   18. Finally, central bank communication is important for the institution to learn, listen and understand. This is a lesson that we have taken to heart in the Reserve Bank. I am referring here not to the standard one way oral or written communication but to two way communica tion between the central bank and its stakeholders, with the centra l bank remaining largely in  a listening mode. During our platinum jubilee last year, we launched the \u2018outreach\u2019 programme whereby all of us in the senior management together with our field office staff and accompanied by senior functionaries of commercial ba nks visited remote villages across the country. This was an immensely rewardi ng learning experience in several ways. Most, of all, we found that listening to people and understanding their concerns enriches our policy making in a very power ful way. Because of its enormous value add, we are continuing the outreach programme as a re gular activity.   Communication - Illustration of Dilemmas 19. I have so far told you, with the help of some recent examples, why central bank communication is growing in importan ce. I have debated about how to go on from here. One option is to  list all that we have done  in the Reserve Bank to improve communication, but that may be a boring litany. Anothe r is to give a  7scholarly discourse on centr al bank communication but there are people around with greater expertise than I to do that. I have theref ore decided that I will give you ten illustrations of the communication dilemm as and challenges that we have faced in the Reserve Bank in the recent period.   (i) Monetary Policy - To Pause or Not to Pause 20. As all of you know, in calibrating the exit from the expansionary monetary stance of the crisis peri od, the Reserve Bank has been struggling with the growth-inflation dynamics over the la st one year. By the time of the second quarter review in early November 2010, we had already rais ed policy interest rates five times. The central issue before this policy review  was whether we should continue on the tightening spree or pause before resuming tightening later on. We  consulted experts and economists and found that opinion wa s divided among them. One view was that we must pause for a bit in order for the rate  hikes already aff ected to play out, and then resume tightening. The opposing view was that we should continue tightening to a point that would deliver RBI\u2019s inflation projection and pause only after that. Inside the Reserve Bank, the view  was that within th e policy trajectory, it did not matter if we paused briefly as long as we remained committed to the eventual outcome. The dilemma then boile d down to communicating to the market that our action should be interpreted only as a comma and not a full stop. Whether or not we managed the dilemma effectiv ely is, of course, for you to judge.    8(ii) Monetary Policy Stance - Forward Guidance 21. Central banks have learnt that giving forward guidance on the policy trajectory is an effective wa y of managing market expectat ions. But they have also learnt that this is not a totally beni gn option. The forward guidance is typically conditional on certain expect ed macroeconomic developments. The dilemma then is how precisely is the conditionality to be communicated, and how to ensure that the market does not ignore the conditionality and interpret the guidance as an irrevocable commitment. In keeping with th e best practice, we in the Reserve Bank too have started giving some forward gui dance. And as expected, we too have confronted the classic communication dilemma. Let me illustrate. In the Second Quarter Review of early November 2010, we had said:  \u201cBased purely on current growth an d inflation trends, the Reserve Bank believes that the likelihood of  further rate actions in the immediate future is relatively low. However, in an uncertain world, we need to be prepared to res pond appropriately to shocks that may emanate from either the global or domestic environment.\u201d  22. Many analysts commended us for the forward guidance, but a few thought that we were imprecise on the conditionality as well as on the time horizon implied by \u2018immediate future\u2019. I can only say that  the element of ambiguity was deliberate because it was unavoidable.   (iii) Monetary Policy Stance - Close to Normal or Closer to Normal? 23. Let me give you another illustration of how we agonize over how every word might be interpreted. In the mid-quart er review of September 2010, as part of the forward guidance, we had said: \u201cthe Reserve Bank believes that the tightening  9that has been carried out over this pe riod has taken the monetary situation close  to normal\u201d.   24. There were two communication dilemmas here. The first was whether we should say \u2018close to\u2019 or \u2018closer to\u2019. In the end, we determined that the forward guidance would be meaningful only if we had said \u2018close to\u2019, thereby giving ourselves room for further action. The s econd dilemma was about whether \u2018normal\u2019 would be interpreted as \u2018neutral\u2019. This dilemma arises in the context of the frequently asked question, \u2018Have the polic y rates become neutral?\u2019 The neutral policy rate, as the economists here would know , is the policy interest rate consistent with potential growth and low and stable inflation. It is, however, not possible to precisely define the neutral rate for a rapidly growing a nd structurally transforming economy like that of India. On the other hand, \u2018normal\u2019 rates can be broadly inferred from the crest and trough of th e policy rates over the growth-inflation cycle. In the post policy dissemination, we  made an extra effort to communicate this distinction between \u2018nor mal\u2019 and \u2018neutral\u2019 rates.   (iv) Monetary Policy Stance - Communicating Uncertainty 25. A frequent dilemma we face is a bout how much of the uncertainty surrounding a policy decision we should communicate. Our policy decisions are based, among other criteria, on macroeconomic  data, all of whic h is in the public domain. The media has more than enough e xpertise to interpre t and analyze this data. Nonetheless, the market is eager to  know the Reserve Bank\u2019 s interpretation of  10the data because, in the ultimate analysis, it is our interpretation that informs the policy decision.   26. To give you an example, the IIP (ind ex of industrial pr oduction) data has been fluctuating in recent months bew ildering analysts about the underlying trend and even raising doubts abou t the quality of the data itself. The market was understandably anxious about how the RBI mi ght read the data. In order to let the market know that we do not know anything  more than it does and to convey the extent of our uncertainty, in our Septembe r 2010 mid-quarter review we said \u2018....the high volatility [of the IIP] over the past two months raises some doubts about how effectively the index reflects the underlyi ng momentum in the industrial sector.\u2019   (v) Disclosing Inflatio n Expectations Survey 27. The Reserve Bank conducts a quarterly inflation expectatio ns survey based on a sample of 4000 respondents spread over 12 cities including the four metros.  We have been doing this since Septem ber 2005 and have gradually refined the survey methodology over time. Although the survey was originally intended to be an internal exercise to improve our apprec iation of the inflation situation, by 2009 there was a growing view within the Re serve Bank that we should \u2018communicate\u2019 the survey results to the public on the princi ple that, as far as possible, there should be no information asymmetry between the public and us. We resolved that issue fairly quickly. We got the data quality a nd data analysis peer reviewed by a high level technical committee, and based on the committee\u2019s endorsement, decided on disclosure.   11 28. The real communication dilemma was the one that followed, whether we will be able to convey the arms length re lationship between the \u2018Reserve Bank\u2019 and the \u2018Reserve Bank Survey\u2019, and make the broader public appreciate that the survey results are the opinion of the respondents and not of the Reserve Bank. We made a serious effort to maintain that distin ction. Initial reports showed that some segments of the public remain confused but we are hoping that that confusion will resolve in due course.   Communication Dilemmas Outside Monetary Policy Arena   29. As I said earlier, communication dile mmas arise not just in the domain of monetary policy but also with respect to  other dimensions of the Reserve Bank\u2019s work. Let me give you some illustrations from those.   (vi) Guidelines for New Bank Licences 30. As you know, there is a proposal to li cence some new banks. The last time the Reserve Bank had formulated guidelines for bank licencing was way back in 2001; the world has changed a lot since the n. We realized that the guidelines for bank licensing need to be revisited in the changed context. The broad issues in new bank licensing are by now quite familiar: the initial size of capital, the period to be allowed for capital dilution, conversion of NBFCs to banks or promotion of banks by NBFCs and the advisability of allowing co rporates to start banks. On several of these issues, the world view has changed; many heresies of the past have become orthodoxies today.    1231. We were eager to evaluate our bank li cencing guidelines in the light of later experience and to get broadbased feedback from all stakeholders. Accordingly we decided to put out a discus sion paper listing the pros and cons of each of the decision criteria. We were genuinely open minded and made deliberate effort to communicate our \u2018open mindedness\u2019. Most me dia and a majority of the analysts had thought we came across quite well on that  count. But a small segment said that we had betrayed our \u2018biases\u2019 causing some  consternation within the Reserve Bank. It is not clear whether we had fallen short in our comm unication effort or whether our interlocutors were superimposing their own prejudices in evaluating us. Regardless, there is a lesson here fo r us to improve our communication.   (vii) Basel III - Gettin g the Message Across 32. As many of you know, the G-20, at its Seoul meeting in November 2010, endorsed the Basel III package for bank regu lation and supervision.  At the heart of Basel III are efforts to fortify the banking system, correct the incentive framework and ensure its long term stability. We, in India, are in the process of evaluating the impact of Basel III on Indian banks and I have spoken about that at length elsewhere2. Basel III poses several ch allenges including communication challenges. Let me illustrate two of the important ones.   33. First, central to Basel III is the id ea that banks should build up capital and provisioning buffers during good times and draw these down during downturns so as to be able to continue  lending while absorbing losses.  The underlying rationale is                                                  2 \u201cPost Crisis Reforms to Banking Regulation and Supervision - Think Global, Act Local \u201d, Inaugural address by Dr. Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor, Reserv e Bank of India, at the FICCI-IBA Conference on \u2018Global Banking: Paradigm Shift\u2019 at Mumbai on September 7, 2010.  13sound, but somewhat counter-intuitive. Experience shows that markets demand that banks maintain higher capital and provisi oning during a downturn to withstand higher risks. If markets con tinue with such expectation, banks would likely \u201choard\u201d capital and stop lending which will exacerbate the downturn. The communication challenge, therefore, is to educate the ma rket on the Basel III notion of buffers and their manner of use so that these safeguard s function the way they are intended to.   34. The second communication challenge under the proposed Basel III package comes from the \u2018comply or explain\u2019 framework under which countries have the option to deviate from certa in components of the pack age and explain why they have deviated. The concern really is that the market, known for its unfailing ruthlessness, will penalize any deviation, and the communication challenge for regulators is to persuade the markets to evaluate the country\u2019s compliance based on the explanation.    (viii) Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) 35. The Basel Committee on Banking Supe rvision (BCBS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) are currently engage d in devising a framework for regulating and supervising systemically important fina ncial institutions (SIFIs). SIFIs, as is well known, were at the centre of the recent crisis. Since they are \u2018too big to fail\u2019 and \u2018too interconnected to fail\u2019, they had to  be rescued at a huge cost to the tax payers. The international level work, cu rrently in progress, is engaged in identifying ways to reduce the moral hazard of SIFIs, defining the criteria for their identification and designing differential ca pital and liquidity surcharge for them.   14 36. Under the arrangement presently under discussi on, SIFIs will be pre-identified on the basis of some defined criteria and su bjected to graded prudential surcharges and other safeguards. These are intended to eliminate the moral hazard, reduce their systemic risk potential, and s hould it become inevitable, allow them to fail in an orderly manner. The intent is to pre-identify SIFIs for the purpose of greater supervision but not to disclose th e list as that would accentuate the moral hazard.   37. The dilemma is how the market might actually respond to this deliberate non-transparency. Will the market guess the list of SIFIs, as indeed it will, and interpret the intent behind the enhanced re gulation as a way of preserving the \u2018too big to fail\u2019 syndrome, continue to give SIFIs competitive advantage in funding markets on such a flawed understanding an d thereby encourage risky behaviour? Or will the market appreciate that the true  intent behind the pre-identification and more stringent regulation and supervision of  SIFIs is to reduce the probability of their failure, and in the event of failure , to make their resolution feasible and apportion the burden across a ll stakeholders wi thout burdening the tax payers?   Limits to Transparency - Some Practical Challenges 38. As many of you will appreciate, there is a difference between appropriate openness and inappropriate openness. Greater  transparency is not always better communication and white noise often co mplicates understanding. Also, central banks may sometimes withhold information for strategic reasons. Many of you will recall the intense debate that preceded th e release of the results of bank stress  15testing in the US. There was an apprehension that banks that come out as \u2018stressed\u2019 will be pushed into a vicious circle of fu rther stress as a result of the disclosure thereby losing the wriggle room to turn  around. Let me give you two examples from our own experience to illustrate th e communication challenges of this type.   (ix) Security Features of Currency Notes 39. We face a classic communication dilemma in disclosing the security features of our currency notes. We are deeply conscious that to check counterfeiting, we need to c onstantly enhance the security  features of the currency. That is necessary but not sufficient. Th e sufficiency condition will be met when people become aware of the security featur es so that they can tell a forged note from a genuine one. The dilemma is that when we launch an awareness drive, we are providing information also to counterfe iters. We resolve this issue by making the replication of security features technically complex and prohibitively expensive, and also by incorporating some additional security features that can be detected only by sophisticated gadgets and equipment. An added challenge in this regard is that our awareness campaign has to educate the public without unduly alarming them.  This has prompted us to opt for a soft campaign rather than a hard-hitting one; it might take longer to create the necessary impact, but it will be more lasting.   (x) Disclosing the Composition of Foreign Exchange Reserves 40. Let me give you another illustration of the limits to transparency. The Reserve Bank puts out the data on foreign ex change reserves every week with a lag of one week. We also publish a half yearly  report on the management of foreign  16exchange reserves indicating several details including the objectives of the reserve management strategy, the adequacy of the re serves, risk management practices etc. However, we do not disclose the currency composition of our reserves and we have been criticized for our lack of communicat ion in this regard. The reason we do not disclose the currency composition is because, as the forex reserves manager, we are like any other commercial entity in the ma rket. The information is market sensitive and disclosure could potentially impact  our commercial interests adversely. Disclosure also has wider implications fo r our international relations. Furthermore, market efficiency is in no way aff ected by our non-disclosure. Indeed non-disclosure is the norm around th e world; a majority of the countries, particularly the large reserve holders, do not disclose th e composition of their foreign exchange reserves.   41. We have, however, progressively moved towards greater disclosure in line with international best practices. The Re serve Bank is among 68 central banks from around the world to have adopted the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) template for publication of detaile d data on foreign exchange reserves, including some information on currenc y composition, investment pattern and forward positions. These data are put out on a monthly basis on RBI's website.  The Reserve Bank is also one of the very few central banks which publish market intervention numbers in its monthly Bu lletin with a lag of two months.    17Role and Responsibility of the Media 42. A lecture on communication dile mmas of central banks would be incomplete without a comment on the role a nd responsibilities of the media. So, let me address that issue briefly.  43. First of all, I want to complime nt the Indian media - both print and electronic - for the useful intermediation ro le they play between policy makers and stakeholders. The media disseminates, interprets and explains the news to the public, and in the reverse direction, conveys  stakeholder concerns, perceptions and opinions to the policy makers. In the Re serve Bank, we enjoy a professional and mutually beneficial relationship with th e media. They add value by informing and educating the stakeholders on RBI policies and actions and keep us on our toes through their feedback and cr itique. I am often impre ssed by the depth of media analysis and their insightful opinion pieces and leaders. I will also let you in on a secret. My staff tutor me painstakingly before scheduled media interactions, but the depth of my understanding is oftentimes put  to test by the media interlocutors who spring questions that we  had not thought of.   44. Even as the media has been an eff ective intermediary between the Reserve Bank and its stakeholders, there are ways  in which it can become even more effective. Let me make a few suggestions in this regard.   45. Sometimes, I find that the competiti on among the media militates against the quality of analysis. The media disseminates economic and financial news, indeed any news, at three levels. The first level is \u2018news\u2019 as \u2018news\u2019 and I can  18appreciate the race to be the first at this  level. The second level is analysis and interpretation and the third level is \u2018opini on\u2019. It is at these latter two levels that competition to be \u2018the first with it\u2019 compromises quality. The media will probably be more effective and value adding if it allows time for digesting the news and thinks through before \u2018analy sis and interpretation\u2019, and does some research before coming out with \u2018opinion\u2019. I am no expert in journalism, but as a consumer of journalism, I think my interests will be better served by more in-depth analysis and critique rather than of the \u2018get up and go\u2019 variety of opinion dissemination.   46. Second, media reporting is sometimes inaccurate, and the risk of misinformation in such cases is high. If  Dr. Reddy Labs in Hyderabad projects 9 per cent earnings growth and if that is  reported under a larg e headline of \u2018Dr. Reddy projects 9 per cent growth\u2019, even th e intelligent reader can be forgiven for believing it to be Dr. Y.V. Reddy, the th en RBI Governor, pr ojecting 9 per cent GDP growth. Surely, more stringent quality  control will make the media a more useful and effective \u2018news intermediator\u2019.   47. Third, as much as I can appreciate the unwavering focus of the media on news that sells, the media has a respons ibility also for br oadbasing its reporting. You often report what policy makers say on the sidelines of an event in broad headlines and completely ignore the event it self. This tendency, I believe, is unfair to the event organizers as well as to your  broader audience who should know of the event.    1948. I am also intrigued by how the media picks up a tiny segment of a speech and reports only that, and that too often out  of context. For example, a few months ago, I spoke at a bankers\u2019 conference on the implications of Basel III for the Indian banking system, and in passing I had ma de a comment about how the salary structure of public sector banks  needs to be revisited to attract and retain talent. I was puzzled by how this bit alone got extensively reported and commented upon. Admittedly the reporting was constructive but I still feel that the larger issues of Basel III too should have made it to news and comment.   49. Finally, a brief but important comment  on the role of the media during the recent crisis. It has played an effective and largely useful role in disseminating news and views, but also on occasion fuelled the frenzy. Some of the panic during the crisis could have been avoided, and at any rate contai ned, if the media opted for restraint instead of sensationalism.   50. I have critiqued the media not so much to find fault but to share my perceptions. I do want to re iterate that the media play s a constructive and value adding role and they are a critical instrume ntality for the RBI as an institution and for me as the Governor in delivering on our mandate.   Conclusion  51. Let me now conclude. In matters of communication, central banks have certainly come a long long way from their haughty indifference of the past to cautious eagerness of the presen t. Consider this. In the 1930s, in response to some criticism of the Bank of E ngland by Lord Keynes, Sir Ernst Harvey, the Deputy  20Governor, deposed before the Macmillan Co mmittee: \u201cAs regards criticism, we (at the Bank of England) do not admit there is a need for de fence; to defend ourselves is somewhat akin to a lady starting to de fend her virtue.\u201d Fast forward to today. Lady of virtue or no virtue, mystique and secrecy are no longer the bywords of central banks. On the other ha nd, central banks are now wise to the fact that in this age of globalization, they can levera ge on communication to enhance their effectiveness.   52. Increasingly, central bank communicati on is not just a matter of openness and transparency, but also of education, guidance, persuasion and dialogue; and of listening and learning. My interest in shar ing with you the dilemmas and challenges we face in our communication has been to convey to you how we carefully weigh the various policy options and how, once we  have made a policy choice, deliberate on what to say and how to say it. The Reserve Bank takes its communication role seriously. It is our continuing endeavour to  communicate in a clear manner so as to minimize scope for misinterpretation; in an  effective manner so that the diverse target groups get the relevant informati on and message; in an honest manner such that we explain the known knowns a nd indicate the known unknowns; and in a consistent manner such that people can li nk our policies and acti on to past trends and future projections.   53. No doubt, in the Reserve Bank, we still have a way to go to reach the best practice in communication. All I can say is we  will make every effort to get there.   211   Reserve Bank of India  Some Recent Initiatives Towards Enhancing Communication ________________________________________________________________  Substantive \u2013 Increased the frequency of  monetary policy reviews \u2013 Pre -policy consultations  with  academics and media in addition to other stakeholders  \u2013 Rationale behind the policy d ecisions and context to the decisions clearly communicated in the monetary policy \u2013 Forward guidance provided as and when expedient \u2013 Expected outcomes from the policy actions are spelt out  \u2013  Rationalised macro and monetary developments and monetary policy documents to avoid overlaps and duplication \u2013 shorter, crisper \u2013 Publication of Financial Stability Report twice a year \u2013 Draft policies on website for feedback \u2013 Explicit efforts to keep the consultation documents on major policy decisions clear of RBI biases  \u2013 Real-time handbook of statistics on the website \u2013 Placing more and more research and data in public domain, including various surv eys that provide inputs for the policy  Procedure       - Publication of Gover nor\u2019s and Deputy Governors\u2019 public engagement schedule on RBI website  to demystify these offices \u2013 Live webcast/telecast of Governor\u2019s press conference and archiving it on website \u2013 Publishing transcript of Gover nor\u2019s press conference on website \u2013 Teleconferencing with media  \u2013 Editors Conference once every year 2  \u2013 Post-policy interaction with researchers/analysts \u2013 Streamlined major RBI publicati ons, including monetary policy, to make them  concise and reader-friendly \u2013 Seminars and briefings with media and academics on important publications and research \u2013 Informal briefings and training programmes for media persons to explain role and functions of  RBI and to explain specific immediate issues \u2013 Publication of comic books on banking and central banking to reach out to children \u2013 Outreach programmes to remote areas across the country for financial literacy/inclusion \u2013 Participation in local exhibitions and melas  \u2013 Town hall events, outside of metr os, to bring central bank closer to the layperson \u2013 Special exhibitions (in Mumbai and Kolkata) to depi ct history of RBI and money \u2013 Opening of financial literacy  centres in regional offices \u2013 Focussed awareness advertising campaigns on matters of public interest   ", "12 Mar 16 MP.pdf": "1  Towards Rules of the Monetary Game1 There are few areas of robust growth around the world, with the IMF repeatedly reducing its growth forecasts in recent quarters. This period of slow growth is particularly dangerous because both industrial countries and a number of  emerging markets need high growth to quell rising domestic political tensions. Policies that attempt to divert growth from others rather than create new growth, or that create growth while fostering instability elsewhere, are more likely under  these circumstances. Even as we create conditions for sustainable growth, we need new rules of the game, enforced impartially by multilateral organizations, to ensure countries adhere to international responsibilities. I propose to sketch how we could do this in this talk.  Why is growth weak?  Why is the world finding it so hard to restore pre- Great Recession growth rates? The immediate answer is that the financial boom preceding the Great Recession left industrial countries with an overhang of debt, and debt, whether on governments, households, or banks, is holding back growth.2 While the remedy may be to write down debt so as to revive demand from the indebted, it is debatable whether additional  debt fueled demand is sustainable. At any rate, large- scale debt write -offs seem politically difficult even if they are economically warranted.  But perhaps the debt overhang points to a deeper cause; the debt -fueled demand before the Great Recession, which has led to the debt overhang now, hid a structural slowdown in global potential growth, perhaps because of the difficult -to-understand consequences of population ageing across the industrial world, and the slowdown in productivity growth.   Structural reforms, typically ones that increase competition, foster innovation, and drive institutional change, are the way to raise potential growth. But these hurt protected constituencies that have become accustomed to the rents they get from the status quo. Moreover, the gains to constituencies that are benefited are typi cally later and uncertain. No wonder Jean- Claude Juncker, then Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, said at the height of the Euro crisis, \u201c We all know what to do, we just don't know how to get re- elected after we've done it!\u201d  The Growth Imperative  If indeed fundamentals are such that that the industrial world has, and will, grow slowly for a while before new technologies and new markets come to the rescue, would it be politically easy to settle for slower growth? After all, per capita income is high in indust rial countries, and a few years of slow growth would not be devastating at the aggregate level. Why is there so much of a political need for growth in industrial countries ? One reason is the need to fulfil government commitments such as debt and social sec urity entitlements. Another reason is that growth is necessary for inter -generational equity, especially because the young, who are most benefited from job creation, are the generations that will be working to pay off commitments to older generations.  Given the young  are also                                                            1 Talk by  Dr. Raghuram Rajan, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India,  at the IMF/Government of India Conference on Advancing Asia: Investing for the Future.  This talk draws extensively on a paper enti tled \u201cRules of the Monetary Game \u201d with Dr. Prachi Mishra at the RBI.   2 See the interesting evidence in Atif Mian and Amir Sufi, House of Debt  (Princeton University Press, New Jersey, 2014) and the cross -country evidence in Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, This Time is Different  (Princeton University Press, New Jersey, 2008). For an illuminating overall view of the global financial crisis and the policy remedies, see Martin Wolf, The Shifts and the Shocks: What We've Learned and Have Still to Learn from the Financial Crisis  (Pengu in USA 2015).  2  the cohorts that can take to the streets, growth is essential for social harmony.  A third reason is that, within country, long periods of below par growth can lead the unemployed to become unemployable.   Growth is also extremely impor tant for emerging markets and developing countries, where populations are typically younger, poorer, and social safety nets thinner. With everyone looking for growth, but limited political room for structural reforms and substantial time lags before they pay off, every country is looking for alternatives.  The Monetary Dilemma  Industrial country c entral bankers know that monetary policy cannot subs titute for structural reforms and  elevate growth potential. They have a different problem  from the country \u2019s political authorities , though its roots may be common. Inflation is flirting with the lower limit of their inflation mandate and threatens to stay lower for long. With interest rates already very low, and with pundits constantly reminding them  that \u201cinflatio n is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon\u201d they have to go beyond ordinary monetary policy, or lose credibility and risk violating their domestic mandate.  No central banker can claim they are out of tools.  For after all, if all else fails, there is the \u201chelicopter drop\u201d, where the central bank prints money and literally spr ays it on the streets to create inflation (more prosaically, it sends a check to every citizen, perhaps more to the poor who are more lik ely to spend).  But before it reaches this pass  of monetary financing of the fiscal deficit , there are a whole range of unconventional tools ranging from various forms of asset purchases termed \u201cquantitative easing\u201d to negative interest rates.  But as centr al bankers flirt with ever more unconventional poli cies, it is worth asking if these policies  really move the economy  towards the desired objective. Monetary policy works through the public\u2019s expectations. If ever more aggressive policy convinces the publi c that calamity is around the corner, it may tempt large segments to save rather than spend. The effect is magnified if there is a sense that the consequences of today\u2019s policies (distorted asset prices, high government debt, high private debt etc.) will have to be reversed in the future  at great cost to the system .  Perhaps worse is if the public believes that policies will never change, and takes on leverage and positions in assets commensurate with that. While this may help the cent ral bank achieve its objectives in the short run , the shifts in asset price when policy does inevitably change,  with effects exacerbated by enhanced leverage, could create enormous dislocation.  While the jury is still out on the effects of unconventional monetary policy on the domestic economy, it seems fair to say that the benefits seem to be diminishing after years of effort, and the costs increasing. Also, if structural impedi ments are the primary cause of slow growth , one could ask if unconventional monetary policy, by givi ng the public the impression that something is being done, actually takes the pressure off politicians to undertake the required policy actions  \u2013 by stating monetary policy is the only game in town, central bankers make it the only game in town. Unfortunat ely, given their domestic inflation mandate, central bankers cannot but try anything that could work. And this leads to an important consequence of their policies that is neglected, the external spillovers effects .  Spillovers from Monetary Policy     All m onetary policies have external spillover effects. If a country reduces domestic interest rates, its exchange rate also typically depreciates, helping exports. The key, however, is that under normal circumstances, the \u201cdemand creating\u201d effects of lower interest rates on 3  domestic consumption and investment tend to be substantial, and the \u201cdemand switching \u201d effects of the lower exchange rate in enhancing external demand for the country\u2019s goods are likely to be relatively small. Indeed, one could argue that the spillovers to the rest of the world could be positive on net, as the enhanced domestic demand draws in substantial imports, offsetting the higher exports.  Matters are less clear in the circumstances we find ourselves in today, and with the unconventional policies countries are adopting. For instance, if the interest rate sensitive segments of the economy are constrained by existing debt, lower rates may have little effect on enhancing domestic demand, but continue to have demand switching effects through the exchange rate.  Similarly, the unconventional \u201cquantitative easing\u201d policy of buying assets such as long term bonds from domestic players may certainly lower long rates but may not have an effect on domestic inves tment if aggregate capacity utilization is low. Indeed, as argued earlier, savers may respond to the increased distortion in asset prices by saving more. And if certain domestic institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies need long term bonds to meet their future claims, they may respond by buying such bonds in less distorted markets abroad. Such a search for yield will depreciate the exchange rate. The primary effect of this policy on domestic demand may be through the \u201cdemand swi tching \u201d effects of a lower exchange rate rather than through a demand creating channel.  Of course, if all countries engage in demand switching policies, we could have a race to the bottom , with no one any better off . Nevertheless, c ountries may find it hard to get out of such policies because the immediate effect for the country that exits might be a serious appreciation of the exchange rate and a fall in domestic activity.  The bottom line is that simply because a policy is called monetary, unconventional  or otherwise, it may not be beneficial on net for the world. That all monetary policies have external spillovers does not mean that they are all justified. What matters is the net spillovers. One source of spillovers is through the trade channel, the relative magnitude of demand creating versus demand switching effects . Another source of spillovers is through cross border capital flows, and their effect on financial stability elsewhere.   Of course, a country\u2019s international responsibilities in this regard are murky, while the central bank\u2019s domestic mandate is explicit. This leads to a possibly serious asymmetry in responsibility. If the central bank is in danger of falling below the lower bound of its inflation mandate, for example, it is required to adopt all possible policies to get inflation back on target, no matter what their  external effect. Indeed, it  can even intervene directly in the exchange rate in a sustained and unidirectional way, though internationally this could be seen as an abdication of international responsibility according to the old standards. In t he current state of affairs , industrial country central banks find all sorts of ways to justify their policies in international fora, without acknowledging the unmentionable \u2013  that the exchange rate may be the primary channel  of transmission, and that adverse capital flow spillovers may be sizeable. Of course, central banks consider \u201c spillbacks\u201d to their policies from abroad, but these may be a small fraction of overall spillovers. In what fol lows, I will examine sensible rules of monetary behavior assuming the domestic mandate does  not trump international responsibility.  Rules of the Game  What would be the basis for the new rules? As described elsewhere, the state of theoretical models and empirical work do not allow for clear cut identification of spillovers and their 4  consequences.3 Rather than wait for clear identification, which may be a long while coming, perhaps as a start policies could be broadly rated based on analytical inputs and discussion. To use a driving analogy, polices that are generally seen to have few adverse spillovers, and are even to be encouraged by the global community should be rated Green, policies that should be used temporarily and with care could be rated Orange, and policies that should be avoided at all times could be rated Red.  To establish such ratings, the effects of any policy have to be seen over time, rather than at a point in time.  In general, policies that are likely to have net adverse outside spillovers over time could be rated red and should be avoided. Such policies obviously include those that have small positive effects in the home country (where the policy action originates) combined with large negative effects in the foreign country (where the spillovers occur). For example, if unconventional monetary policy actions lead to small positive effects on exports to emerging economies (EMs) and a feeble recovery in the source country but large capital outflows and asset price bubbles in the EMs,  these policies could be rated R ed. Global welfare would decrease with this policy.  If a policy has positive effects on both home and foreign countries, and therefore on global welfare, it would definitely be rated Green. Conventional monetary policy would typica lly fall in this category, as it would raise output in the home economy, and create demand for exports from the foreign economy. A Green rating for such policies would, however, assume that the stage of the financial and credit cycle in the home and foreig n economies is such that financial stability risks from low interest rates are likely to be limited.  A policy could also be rated Green if it acts as a booster shot and can jump -start a large home economy, but creates temporary negative spillovers for the foreign economy. Even if there are temporary adverse spillovers on foreign countries, the policy , through its effect on home economy gr owth and demand for foreign goods, can eventually provide offsetting large positive spillovers to the rest of the world. Of course, it is important that the home economy, after receiving the booster shot and picking up growth, not follow policies (such as holding down its exchange rate) that minimize positive spillovers to other countries. A policy rated Red on a static basis could thus be deemed Green based on implicit commitments over time.  It is possible to visualize other policies that have large posit ive effects for the originating country (because of the value of the policy or because of the country\u2019s relative size) and sustained small negative effects for the rest of the world. Global welfare, crudely speaking, may go up with the policy, even though welfare outside the originating country goes down. While it is hard to rate such policies without going into specifics, these may correctly belong in the O range category \u2013  permissible for some time but not on a sustained basis. Even conventional monetary policies to raise growth in the home economy could fall in the O range category if countries are at a stage of financial cycle where low interest rates lead to significant financial stability risks in the home and foreign economies.  Clearly, foreign countri es may have policy room to respond, and that should be taken into account. Perhaps the right way to measure spillovers to the foreign country is to measure their welfare without the policy under question` and their welfare after the policy is implemented and response initiated. So, for instance, a home country A at the zero lower bound may initiate Quantitative Easing (QE), and a foreign country B may respond by cutting interest rates to avoid capital inflows and exchange rate appreciation. The spillover ef fects of                                                            3 See Prachi Mishra and Raghuram Rajan, \u201cRules of the Monetary Game\u201d, 2016, mimeo .  5  QE would be based on B\u2019s welfare if QE was not undertaken versus B\u2019s welfare after QE is initiated and it responds.  Overa ll, whether policies are rated R ed, Green, or O range would depend on a number of factors such as the time dimension; stage of  the financial and business cycle in the home and foreign countries; whether the policy action constitutes a booster shot to jump start the economy or gives only a mild boost and has to be employed for a sustained period; whether standard transmission channels are clogged to warrant the use of unconventional policies; whether the foreign country has room to adopt buffering policies; whether the spillovers impact poor countries which have weak institutions and less room to respond, etc.  Moving Forward  The next crucial question is: who should measure and analyze spillovers, what would be an appropriate forum to discuss spillover effects from specific policies, and the ratings of these policies? How should we proceed?  International Discussion  Given the constr aints and political difficulties under which international organizations operate, it may be appropriate to start with a group of eminent academics with reasonable representation across the globe, and have them measure and analyze the spillovers, and grade policies.  Perhaps the next step would be an agreement to discuss policies and their international spillover effects at meetings such as those of the IMF Board, the IMFC, the BIS and the G -20. The discussion would be based on background papers, which would be commissioned from both traditional sources like the IMF, as well as non- traditional sources like the group of academics and EM central banks.  These papers would attempt to isolate the nature of spillovers as well as their magnitude, and attempt a preli minary classification of policy actions. Almost surely, there will be a lot of fuzziness about which color to attribute to a wide range of recent policies. But discussion can help participants understand both how the policies could be classified if we had better models and data, as well as how the models and data gathering can be improved.  Country Responsibilities before Formal Rules  When policies are being discussed so as to get better understanding, no policies that affect the international monetary syst em should be off the table. Importantly, simply denoting a policy with the label \u201cmonetary\u201d should not give it an automatic free pass because it falls under the central bank\u2019s domestic mandate. What will be important is neither the policymaker\u2019s mandate, professed intent, or instruments, but actual channels of transmission and outcomes, including spillovers.  Policymakers will respond to the background papers by stating and explaining their policy actions, attempting to persuade the international community t hey fall in the Green and Orange zones.  International Conference  Perhaps free and frank discussion may be enough to get countries to adopt responsible policies. If not, as the international community builds understanding on what constitutes sensible rules  of the game, and how to label policies in that context, perhaps an international conference may be warranted to see how the community\u2019s understanding of beneficial rules can be implemented. At that time, a discussion of how a central bank\u2019s international 6  responsibilities fit in with its domestic mandate may be warranted. While recognizing the political difficulty of altering any central bank\u2019s mandate, the conference will have to deliberate on how international responsibilities can be woven into existing m andates. It will also have to decide whether a new international agreement along the lines of Bretton Woods is needed, or whether much can be accomplished by small changes in the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Articles of Agreement.     Role of the Fund  What role would the Fund play? The obligations of members and the authority of the Fund are derived from the Articles of Agreement. Section 1 of Article IV makes clear that IMF members are under general obligation \u201cto collaborate with other members of the Fund to assure orderly exchange arrangements and to promote a stable system of exchange rates\u201d. The meaning of \u201cgeneral obligation\u201d is unclear in the Articles but could be \u201crelied upon as a basis for the Fund to call on its members to take specific actions or  to refrain from taking specific actions\u201d (IMF, 2006). Article IV further states that \u201cIn particular, each member shall \u2026 (iii) avoid manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in order to prevent effective balance of payments adjustm ent or to gain unfair competitive advantage over other members \u2026..\u201d.  Further, The Principles for the Guidance of Members\u2019 Exchange Rate Policies (originally 1977, amended in 2007) notes that \u201c \u2026 C. Members should take into account in their intervention policies the interests of other members, including those in whose currency they intervene\u201d.  Although the Articles of Agreement or The Principles do not define \u201cmanipulation\u201d in any detail, IMF (2007) narrows the scope of manipulation by noting that \u201cmanipulation of the exchange rate is only carried through policies that are targeted at \u2013  and actually affect \u2013  the level of exchange rate. Moreover, manipulation may cause the exchange rate to move or may prevent such movement.\u201d  In practice, it may be difficult to determine if a policy is targeted at attaining a level of exchange rate. Direct policy actions such as intervention in the foreign exchange market, or indirect policies such as monetary, fiscal, and trade policies or regulations of capital movements, re gardless of the intent or purpose, can affect the level of the exchange rate, and can be interpreted as \u201cmanipulation\u201d. The interpretation of the Articles of Agreement could perhaps be broadened in scope to include a wider range of policies, which can primarily have effects on the exchange rates, and therefore beggar -thy-neighbor consequences.  While the Articles of Agreement include members\u2019 obligations in relation to exchange rate policies, global financial stability implications of country specific polici es are not touched upon anywhere in the Articles. Members\u2019 obligations are considered only in relation to domestic growth objectives. For example, based on the Articles, a country with a weak economy can pursue loose monetary policies to stimulate output and employment. Despite the implications of such policies for financial stability in other countries, the country would argue that its policies are in line with Article IV, Section 1(i) which allows each member to \u201c(i) \u2026 direct its economic and financial policies toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability \u2026\u201d.  More generally, the Fund\u2019s Articles may need altering based on the discussion of the rules of the game.  Moreover, although broader surveillance by the Fund of its members\u2019 exchange rate policies, and other policies with significant financial sector spillovers, and perhaps public statements about such policies can have signaling effects, countries are not obligated to follow Fund advice unless in a program. The more pertinent question, therefore, might be what can the 7  Fund really do once its Executive Board determines that a particular country is in violation of its obligations under the new rules of the game? Hopefully, the clear focus on the downsides of the particular country\u2019s actions for the rest of the world will lead to political and economic pressures from around the world that make the country cease and desist. The clearer the eventual rules of the game, the more likely this outcome.  Conclusion  Given  the importance of spillovers from monetary policies, especially in the face of globally low inflation, it is important we start building a global consensus on how to get better outcomes for the world. Nevertheless, with economic analysis of these issues at an early stage, it is unlikely we will get strong policy prescriptions soon, let alone international agreement on them, especially given that a number of country authorities like central banks have explicit domestic mandates.  This paper therefore suggest s a period of focused discussion, first outside international meetings, then within international meetings. Such a discussion need not take place in an environment of finger pointing and defensiveness, but as an attempt to understand what can be reasonable, and not overly intrusive, rules of conduct.  As consensus builds on the rules of conduct, we can contemplate the next step of whether to codify them through international agreement, see how the Articles of multilateral watchdogs like the IMF will have to be altered, and how country authorities will i nterpret or alter domestic mandates to incorporate international responsibilities.  The international community has a choice. We can pretend all is well with the global financial non-system and hope that nothing goes spectacularly wrong. Or we can start building a system for the integrated world of the twenty first century. I do hope we can consider some initial steps. Thank you.

I would like to place  on record  the Reserve Bank\u2019s appreciation of the critical role played by FIMMDA and PDAI in the development of financial markets in India over the years , and more recently , in partnering with the RBI in guiding the markets and the economy through the turbulent times of  COVID -19, the war in Ukraine and the turmoil in financial markets.    2. Today, as I speak before keen market players, veterans and experts , I thought this would be an opportune moment to recapture the journey of our financial markets in the last decade or so and reflect on where we are and what we think about the course ahead. An attempt to draw from the past and forge ahead, so to speak .  3. From the global financial crisis to the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis; from the taper tantrum  to Brexit; from unprecedented quantitative easing to among the most accelerated monetary tightening in recent memory ; from a pandemic which brought humankind to a standstill to a geopolitical crisis which threatens  the world order as it exists today  - it                                                             1 Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India  (FIMMDA)  2 Primary  Dealers \u2019 Association of India ( PDAI ) 2  would not be an exaggeration to say that the world has moved from one storm to another in the years since the global financial crisis .   4. Against this backdrop, the journey of Indian financial markets has been driven by two  key objectives \u2013 stability and development . Crisis management has been a key component of this journey.  Nonetheless, the pursuit of developmental reforms , with the key objective of widening and deepening of financial markets was continued even amidst the worst storms . The Journey so far  5. Let me take a moment to reflect on the journey of Indian financial markets over the past few decades. Right up to the end of the 1980s, the Indian economy was characterised by an administered interest rate regime,  fixed exchange rates, a captive government securities  market  and current and capital account restrictions. P olicy measures during the decade of the 1990s set the stage for a transition to market -determined interest and exchange rates, shift to a multiple indicator approach and eventually to flexible inflation targeting in the conduct of  monetary policy, convertibility in the current account and gradual liberalisation of the capital account. The policy measures were bolstered by several key legislative changes :  the Foreign Exchange Management Act  (FEMA), 1999; the Government Securities Act, 2006 ; the amendments to the RBI Act in 2006 to give explicit regulatory powers to the Reserve Bank  over government securitie s, derivatives, and money market instruments ; and t he Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. The Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. was set up in 2001 to provide clearing and guaranteed settlement for money, government securitie s, forex 3  and derivative markets. A Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS)  and the NDS -OM platform were operationalised.  A Trade Repository was put in place  for derivatives . Some of these initiatives became important at a global level only after the G20 rolled out its reforms agenda in the 2009 Pittsburgh  Summit.   6. After the global financial crisis  (2008) , the Indian financial markets were nascent but growing. The approach to foreign participation in most market  segments  was cautious . Derivative markets , the markets for the purpose of  hedging risks, were limited in terms of participant s and products. Meanwhile, the BIS Triennial survey published in 2013 showed that there was growing interest in the Indian Rupee overseas . The onshore and offshore markets for the Rupee, however, remained segmented,  with the spreads between the onshore and offshore forex and interest rates being wide .  Headwinds and T ailwinds   7. Coming to more recent times, many of our policies over the last decade have been guided by the learnings from crisis management  as well as the developmental objectives our country aspires to achieve.  As the world moved through one storm after another, we were compelled to navigate through the spillovers of major global headwinds.   8. Equally compelling in guiding policy were the needs of the economy . As the real sector grew over the last decade, expectations  from the financial markets also grew . The needs of the economy reflect these developments. To place this in perspective, let\u2019s look at some figures . Nominal GDP increased  four-fold from \u20b964 lakh crore for FY 4  2010 to \u20b9273 lakh crore for FY 2023.3 External trade also increased over four -fold from \u20b929 lakh crore to \u20b9137 lakh crore  during the same period.4 The ratio of trade to GDP5 has risen to 45% in 2021 from 25% in 2000. Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI)6 in the country has risen sharply by two and a half times since 2010.  The flow of resources to the commercial sector in India almost doubled from \u20b912 lakh crore in FY 2012 to \u20b922 lakh crore in FY 2022.7 While banks continue to be a dominant source of financing, market borrowings8 of the commercial sector increased from \u20b974,000 crore in FY 2012 to \u20b93 ,16,000 crore in FY 2022. As our economy and financial markets grew, the integration with the world economy and global financial markets has also risen. The growing econom y and our aspirations to be and remain among the fastest growing economies has expanded our funding needs.  All these necessitate larger and deeper financial markets.  The policy response  to headwinds  9. It is relevant to look at some of our policy response s in recent times , especially to major global headwinds . Each successive episode of turmoil over the last decade and half has posed a specific set of challenges for the economy. Each has warranted a specific response.   10. In 2008, policy actions were aimed at ensuring comfortable system liquidity; augment ing forex reserves and maintaining  a crisis management framework  to support the economy  through the global financial crisis . Conventional tools such as policy interest rates and                                                             3 Source: Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation  4 Source: Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, RBI Balance of Payment Statistics  5 Source: World Bank  6 Source: Reserve Bank of India  7 Source: RBI Handbook of Statistics   8 Market borrowing includes public & rights issues by non -financial entities, gross private placements by non -financial entities and net issuance of commercial papers subscribed to by non- banks.  5  cash reserve ratio (CRR)  were used.  Measures to manage forex liquidity included, inter alia , relaxing the interest rate ceiling on foreign currency deposits by non -resident Indians and external commercial borrowings (ECB) for corporates. U nconventional measures  included a rupee -dollar swap facility for Indian banks , a refinance window for mutual funds and a special purpose vehicle for supporting nonbanking financial companies.   11. Post the announcement of early taper of quantitative easing by the Fed eral Reserve in 2013 , the need for restoring  confidence of market participants and containing  the pressure on t he Rupee  guided  the Reserve Bank \u2019s policy responses. Monetary conditions were tightened  through unconventional  tools . Forex market measures included both direct intervention and administrative measures  to manage capital flows. These  included import restrictions of non-essential items , opening of a special dollar swap window for PSU oil companies, a concessional swap window for Foreign Currency Non -Resident (FCNR -B) deposits, increased  overseas borrowing limit s of banks , enhanced foreign investment limits in government debt  and restrictions  on outward investment flows , Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) entitlement s as well as exchange -traded derivatives.   12. The outbreak of the COVID -19 pandemic in March 2020 necessitated swift and focussed policy responses to address the emerging or potential market dislocations.  As in the past, policy rates were reduced and systemic liquidity was expanded. But, this time, the policy corridor was asymmetrically widened and the fixed rate reverse repo became the effective anchor for the evolution of short and longer -6  term interest rates . To improve transmission of policy rates and ensure flow of credit to the affected  sectors, unconventional measures  were used viz., the L ong-Term Repo Operations (LTROs),  targeted LTROs  and special refinance facilities to All India Financial Institutions. A special liquidity facility for mutual funds aimed at assuaging  redemption pressures  was also instituted. For the first time, the Reserve Bank  pledged its balance sheet to revive the economy through a Government  Securities Acquisition Programme (G -SAP) which provid ed an upfront commitment on the amounts to be purchased. Special open market operations involving simultaneous purchase and sale of securities  (Operation Twist)  were undertaken for orderly evolution of the yield curve and liquidity management . Forward guidance gained prominence  with the emergence of  time and state- contingent guidance , with assurances on the Reserve Bank \u2019s commitment to maintain congenial financial conditions . Communication became a significant part of our monetary policy toolkit.   13. The onset of the war in Ukraine again weakened risk sentiment , with commodity prices and inflation rising to multi -decade highs. As major central banks accelerated policy rate hikes  and tighten ed liquidity to tackle inflationary pressures , financial market volatility  spiralled,  and the Rupee came under considerable pressure . The policy response this time eschewed administrative measures to c ontain outflows and instead focused on measures to enhance inflows  through incentivising non-resident deposits , foreign investments in debt instruments and ECBs . To promote exports and support the increasing global interest in the Rupee , an additional arra ngement for invoicing, payment and settlement of exports/ imports in Rupee s was put in place.  7  14. The point I want to emphasi se here is that while there were clear common strands in the Reserve Bank\u2019s response to various episode s of turmoil, the response was customised  to each episode  in terms of policy objectives  and choices , and use of toolkits . Every  response was a function of the underlying macro economic conditions and reflected learnings from earlier crises. In this context, I would like to mention three distinctive  features of our policy responses. First, a ll liquidity management operations by the Reserve Bank , including measures for mutual funds and NBFCs, have always been through banks  which are the liquidity conduits for the Reserve Bank  even in peace times.  Second, t he measures entailed no dilution of collateral standards  and ensured  that the central bank remained cushioned from counterparty risks.  Third, most  of the  measures this time around were time -bound and ex pired as per their originally defined maturity . Illustratively, the G -SAP was discontinued , relaxations with respect to CRR were allowed to normalise and the liquidity management framework was tweaked in April 2022 to operationalise the standing deposit facility  (SDF) . This approach has enabled us to get out of a potential liquidity trap, the Chakravyuh.   15. Interestingly and perhaps p aradoxically, the measures to reform and develop financial markets have taken place at an unprecedented pace during a decade of unprecedented challenges. The reforms were aimed at deepen ing onshore financial market s and increasing  the efficiency of price discovery. The more  recent reform s  sought to  (i) remove market segmentation by simultaneously easing access of non-residents to domestic markets and permitting residents to access 8  offshore markets;  (ii) expand the participation base by encouraging non-resident participation  in financial markets  and retail participation through the provision of easy access , for example through the Retail Direct and FX Retail platforms ; (iii) facilitat e more sophisticated users to access markets for their hedging needs and to express their views on market movements; (iv) promote innovation through the introduction of a larger suite of products which can be customised to the needs of individual market participants;9 and (v) ensure fair user conduct through protection of the retail user and a sound , receptive  and a customer suitability  framework . A robust infrastructure and conduct framework has been put in place through efficient clearing and settlement arrangements, benchmark reforms, transparency requirements and stipulations on market abuse, among others.    16. India has also come a long way towards achieving higher levels of capital account convertibility. Liberalisation of F oreign Direct Investment (FDI)  flows continued over the last decade,  with FDI becoming unrestricted except in certain sensitive / strategic sectors. Limits for non -resident investments in domestic market markets were liberalised. The Voluntary Retention Route (VRR)  was introduced to facilitate  non-resident investment in government and corporate bonds . A Fully Accessible Route  (FAR)  which places no limit on non- resident investment in specified benchmark government securities  was introduced  as part of further liberalisation of portfolio debt inflows . The ECB framework was comprehensively liberalised and is now subject                                                             9 The directions on  market mak ing in OTC derivatives which came into effect from Jan uary 2022 permitted market makers to offer a variety of derivative products to residents to efficiently design strategies to hedge their risks. Subsequently, several new products, e.g., FX barrier option, binary option, targeted range forwards in the forex market and swaptions and total return swaps in the interest rate market have been introduced.  9  only to an overall soft limit  and a few \u201cend use \u201d restrictions . Regulations for Overseas Direct Investment s (ODI)  have also been rationalised and liberalised . The LRS is now available for both current and capital account transactions.  Where do we stand today ? 17. In the aftermath of multiple shocks, the global economy is projected to contract significantly in 2023. The worst for the global economy , both in terms of growth and inflation, seems to be behind us. Lately, with some ebbing of COVID -related restrictions  and cooling of inflation in various countries, though still elevated, central banks have started what appears to be a pivot towards lower rate hikes or pauses. At the same time, they continue to emphatically reiterate  their resolve to bring inflation down closer to target s. High policy  rates for a longer duration appear to be a distinct possibility, going forward. On the growth front, projections are now veering around to a softer recession as against a severe and more widespread recession projected a few months back.   18. In this hostile and uncertain international environment, the Indian economy remains resilient , drawing  strength from its macroeconomic fundamentals. Our financial system remains robust and stable. Banks and corporates are healthier than before the crisis. Bank credit is growing in double digits. India is widely seen as a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy world. Our inflation remains elevated, but there has been a welcome softening during November and December 2022. Core inflation, however, remains sticky and elevated.   10  19. On the external front, de -globalisation and protectionism are  gaining ground as witnessed during the recent global supply -chain shock. It is thus necessary to build and strengthen bilateral trade relations to deal with such challenges. India has recently signed bilateral trade agreements with the UAE and Australia a nd more such agreements are works in progress . The average current account deficit to GDP ratio stands at 3.3 per cent during H1:2022 -23. The slowing global demand is weighing on merchandise exports; but our exports of services and remittances remain strong. The net balance under services and remittances remains in a large surplus, partly offsetting the trade deficit. Consequently, the current account deficit is eminently manageable and within the parameters of viability.   20. On the financing side, net FDI flows remain strong and f oreign portfolio flows have resumed since July 2022, with intermittent outflows  from time to time  The size of forex reserves is comfortable and has gone up from US D 524 billion on October 21, 2022 to US D 572 billion as on January 13, 2023. Further, India\u2019s external debt ratios are low by international standards . This has enabled the Reserve Bank  to eschew measures to control capital flows and take steps to further internationalise the domestic currency, even during episodes of significant capital outflows.   21. Every global risk -off episode resulted in an appreciating US dollar imposing downward pressures on most other currencies. Compari son of the performance10 of the Rupee across successive crisis episodes                                                             10 Source: Data from Bloomberg has been used to evaluate the performance of Rupee.  11  tells its own tale. During the global financial crisis, t he Rupee witnessed its worst depreciation -  between April 1, 2008 and March 3, 2009 - when it  lost 23% against the US dollar. Similarly, it depreciate d by 22% during the taper tantrum between May 01, 2013 and Aug 28, 2013. However, t he extent of Rupee depreciation was  lower in each subsequent episode of turbulence. In the initial days of the pandemic, i.e., between February 17, 2020 and April 21, 2020, the Rupee depreciated by only 7%. Even during the period of geopolitical tensions emerging out of Ukraine in 2022, whi le the Rupee lost  9% against the US dollar between February 24, 2022 and October 19, 2022, it  outperformed the currencies of most advanced and many emerging market economies.    22. Importantly, the Rupee\u2019s performance in terms of volatility remained impressive . For example, t he 1- month implied volatility of the Rupee  touched a high of 25% during the global financial crisis on October 10, 2008 and 2 0% during the taper tantrum period on August 29, 2013. During the COVID -19 pandemic, however, the implied volatility peaked at 10% on March 24, 2020 and has remained well anchored11 thereafter , despite the uncertainties associated with the war and monetary tightening by major central banks. The Government bond market has also remained resilient , with average bid- ask spreads being the lowest among peer nations.  The yield curve has also evolved in an orderly manner without any undue volatility , despite the significantly higher government borrowing.                                                              11 Daily average 1 -month implied volatility of Rupee was 5% between January 1, 2022 and January 20, 2023 and reached a high of 8% on March 7, 2022.  Source: Bloomberg  12  Looking ahead  23. Today, when we look ahead, we  still see challenges , but we can prepare for them with optimism and confidence.  The Indian financial markets have developed appreciably over the years. Liquidity in the government securities  and the overnight money markets have grown. Bid-ask spreads remain narrow , reflecting efficiency in price discovery . In the forex market, overall trading volumes have grown, and a suite of hedging products have emerged. Volumes in the interest rate swap market have grown consistently and new products in these markets are also developing. Onshore and offshore markets are getting increasingly integrated with narrowing of forex and interest rates across the markets. Non-resident participation in markets is growing, albeit gradually.   24. The global economy is still marred by shocks and uncertainty. Financial markets remain volatile and the geopolitical situation continues to be tense. International food, energy and commodity prices have eased but uncertainties do remain . Inflation remains high and broad -based  across countries . The IMF has projected contractions in over one -third of the global economy .   25. In India, w e have come a long way in the development of financial markets, but this remains  work in progress. The Reserve Bank and stakeholders  like FIMMDA and PDAI need to work together and focus on certain specific areas. Secondary market liquidity in g-secs is concentrated in a few securities and tenors. The MIBOR -based OIS remains the only major liquid product in the interest rate derivative market. A term money market remains absent , notwithstanding a host of facilitative policy measures. Access of the retail segment to markets, 13  especially derivative markets, needs to improve further . In the forex markets, while corporates benefit from the tight bid -ask spreads , smaller users continue to face pricing disadvantages notwithstanding regulatory requirements for fair and transparent pricing.  Likewise, there remains a need for improvement  in ensuring liquidity for retail investors in the government securities markets.    Conclusion  26. The journey of Indian financial markets through the last decade has been a story of steady progress with  stability. We have been steadfast in our commitment and consistent in our approach to keep the ship stable while continuing to move ahead. Going forward, greater challenges will emerge as the footprints of Indian banks increase in the offshore markets, the  range  of product s expand, non-resident participation in domestic markets grows and as capital account convertibility increases. Market participants will have to prepare themselves to manage the changes and the risks associated with globally integrated markets. The achievement of desired outcomes is contingent on financial institutions and market participants taking forward the reform agenda so that we have more vibrant and resilient  financial markets .  Thank you.

I would like to place  on record  the Reserve Bank\u2019s appreciation of the critical role played by FIMMDA and PDAI in the development of financial markets in India over the years , and more recently , in partnering with the RBI in guiding the markets and the economy through the turbulent times of  COVID -19, the war in Ukraine and the turmoil in financial markets.    2. Today, as I speak before keen market players, veterans and experts , I thought this would be an opportune moment to recapture the journey of our financial markets in the last decade or so and reflect on where we are and what we think about the course ahead. An attempt to draw from the past and forge ahead, so to speak .  3. From the global financial crisis to the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis; from the taper tantrum  to Brexit; from unprecedented quantitative easing to among the most accelerated monetary tightening in recent memory ; from a pandemic which brought humankind to a standstill to a geopolitical crisis which threatens  the world order as it exists today  - it                                                             1 Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India  (FIMMDA)  2 Primary  Dealers \u2019 Association of India ( PDAI ) 2  would not be an exaggeration to say that the world has moved from one storm to another in the years since the global financial crisis .   4. Against this backdrop, the journey of Indian financial markets has been driven by two  key objectives \u2013 stability and development . Crisis management has been a key component of this journey.  Nonetheless, the pursuit of developmental reforms , with the key objective of widening and deepening of financial markets was continued even amidst the worst storms . The Journey so far  5. Let me take a moment to reflect on the journey of Indian financial markets over the past few decades. Right up to the end of the 1980s, the Indian economy was characterised by an administered interest rate regime,  fixed exchange rates, a captive government securities  market  and current and capital account restrictions. P olicy measures during the decade of the 1990s set the stage for a transition to market -determined interest and exchange rates, shift to a multiple indicator approach and eventually to flexible inflation targeting in the conduct of  monetary policy, convertibility in the current account and gradual liberalisation of the capital account. The policy measures were bolstered by several key legislative changes :  the Foreign Exchange Management Act  (FEMA), 1999; the Government Securities Act, 2006 ; the amendments to the RBI Act in 2006 to give explicit regulatory powers to the Reserve Bank  over government securitie s, derivatives, and money market instruments ; and t he Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. The Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. was set up in 2001 to provide clearing and guaranteed settlement for money, government securitie s, forex 3  and derivative markets. A Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS)  and the NDS -OM platform were operationalised.  A Trade Repository was put in place  for derivatives . Some of these initiatives became important at a global level only after the G20 rolled out its reforms agenda in the 2009 Pittsburgh  Summit.   6. After the global financial crisis  (2008) , the Indian financial markets were nascent but growing. The approach to foreign participation in most market  segments  was cautious . Derivative markets , the markets for the purpose of  hedging risks, were limited in terms of participant s and products. Meanwhile, the BIS Triennial survey published in 2013 showed that there was growing interest in the Indian Rupee overseas . The onshore and offshore markets for the Rupee, however, remained segmented,  with the spreads between the onshore and offshore forex and interest rates being wide .  Headwinds and T ailwinds   7. Coming to more recent times, many of our policies over the last decade have been guided by the learnings from crisis management  as well as the developmental objectives our country aspires to achieve.  As the world moved through one storm after another, we were compelled to navigate through the spillovers of major global headwinds.   8. Equally compelling in guiding policy were the needs of the economy . As the real sector grew over the last decade, expectations  from the financial markets also grew . The needs of the economy reflect these developments. To place this in perspective, let\u2019s look at some figures . Nominal GDP increased  four-fold from \u20b964 lakh crore for FY 4  2010 to \u20b9273 lakh crore for FY 2023.3 External trade also increased over four -fold from \u20b929 lakh crore to \u20b9137 lakh crore  during the same period.4 The ratio of trade to GDP5 has risen to 45% in 2021 from 25% in 2000. Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI)6 in the country has risen sharply by two and a half times since 2010.  The flow of resources to the commercial sector in India almost doubled from \u20b912 lakh crore in FY 2012 to \u20b922 lakh crore in FY 2022.7 While banks continue to be a dominant source of financing, market borrowings8 of the commercial sector increased from \u20b974,000 crore in FY 2012 to \u20b93 ,16,000 crore in FY 2022. As our economy and financial markets grew, the integration with the world economy and global financial markets has also risen. The growing econom y and our aspirations to be and remain among the fastest growing economies has expanded our funding needs.  All these necessitate larger and deeper financial markets.  The policy response  to headwinds  9. It is relevant to look at some of our policy response s in recent times , especially to major global headwinds . Each successive episode of turmoil over the last decade and half has posed a specific set of challenges for the economy. Each has warranted a specific response.   10. In 2008, policy actions were aimed at ensuring comfortable system liquidity; augment ing forex reserves and maintaining  a crisis management framework  to support the economy  through the global financial crisis .

Post the announcement of early taper of quantitative easing by the Fed eral Reserve in 2013 , the need for restoring  confidence of market participants and containing  the pressure on t he Rupee  guided  the Reserve Bank \u2019s policy responses. Monetary conditions were tightened  through unconventional  tools . Forex market measures included both direct intervention and administrative measures  to manage capital flows. These  included import restrictions of non-essential items , opening of a special dollar swap window for PSU oil companies, a concessional swap window for Foreign Currency Non -Resident (FCNR -B) deposits, increased  overseas borrowing limit s of banks , enhanced foreign investment limits in government debt  and restrictions  on outward investment flows , Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) entitlement s as well as exchange -traded derivatives.   12.

In this hostile and uncertain international environment, the Indian economy remains resilient , drawing  strength from its macroeconomic fundamentals. Our financial system remains robust and stable. Banks and corporates are healthier than before the crisis. Bank credit is growing in double digits. India is widely seen as a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy world. Our inflation remains elevated, but there has been a welcome softening during November and December 2022. Core inflation, however, remains sticky and elevated.   10  19. On the external front, de -globalisation and protectionism are  gaining ground as witnessed during the recent global supply -chain shock. It is thus necessary to build and strengthen bilateral trade relations to deal with such challenges. India has recently signed bilateral trade agreements with the UAE and Australia a nd more such agreements are works in progress . The average current account deficit to GDP ratio stands at 3.3 per cent during H1:2022 -23. The slowing global demand is weighing on merchandise exports; but our exports of services and remittances remain strong. The net balance under services and remittances remains in a large surplus, partly offsetting the trade deficit. Consequently, the current account deficit is eminently manageable and within the parameters of viability.   20. On the financing side, net FDI flows remain strong and f oreign portfolio flows have resumed since July 2022, with intermittent outflows  from time to time  The size of forex reserves is comfortable and has gone up from US D 524 billion on October 21, 2022 to US D 572 billion as on January 13, 2023. Further, India\u2019s external debt ratios are low by international standards . This has enabled the Reserve Bank  to eschew measures to control capital flows and take steps to further internationalise the domestic currency, even during episodes of significant capital outflows.   21. Every global risk -off episode resulted in an appreciating US dollar imposing downward pressures on most other currencies. Compari son of the performance10 of the Rupee across successive crisis episodes                                                             10 Source: Data from Bloomberg has been used to evaluate the performance of Rupee.  11  tells its own tale. During the global financial crisis, t he Rupee witnessed its worst depreciation -  between April 1, 2008 and March 3, 2009 - when it  lost 23% against the US dollar. Similarly, it depreciate d by 22% during the taper tantrum between May 01, 2013 and Aug 28, 2013. However, t he extent of Rupee depreciation was  lower in each subsequent episode of turbulence. In the initial days of the pandemic, i.e., between February 17, 2020 and April 21, 2020, the Rupee depreciated by only 7%. Even during the period of geopolitical tensions emerging out of Ukraine in 2022, whi le the Rupee lost  9% against the US dollar between February 24, 2022 and October 19, 2022, it  outperformed the currencies of most advanced and many emerging market economies.    22. Importantly, the Rupee\u2019s performance in terms of volatility remained impressive . For example, t he 1- month implied volatility of the Rupee  touched a high of 25% during the global financial crisis on October 10, 2008 and 2 0% during the taper tantrum period on August 29, 2013. During the COVID -19 pandemic, however, the implied volatility peaked at 10% on March 24, 2020 and has remained well anchored11 thereafter , despite the uncertainties associated with the war and monetary tightening by major central banks. The Government bond market has also remained resilient , with average bid- ask spreads being the lowest among peer nations.  The yield curve has also evolved in an orderly manner without any undue volatility , despite the significantly higher government borrowing.                                                              11 Daily average 1 -month implied volatility of Rupee was 5% between January 1, 2022 and January 20, 2023 and reached a high of 8% on March 7, 2022.  Source: Bloomberg  12  Looking ahead  23. Today, when we look ahead, we  still see challenges , but we can prepare for them with optimism and confidence.  The Indian financial markets have developed appreciably over the years. Liquidity in the government securities  and the overnight money markets have grown. Bid-ask spreads remain narrow , reflecting efficiency in price discovery . In the forex market, overall trading volumes have grown, and a suite of hedging products have emerged. Volumes in the interest rate swap market have grown consistently and new products in these markets are also developing. Onshore and offshore markets are getting increasingly integrated with narrowing of forex and interest rates across the markets. Non-resident participation in markets is growing, albeit gradually.   24. The global economy is still marred by shocks and uncertainty. Financial markets remain volatile and the geopolitical situation continues to be tense. International food, energy and commodity prices have eased but uncertainties do remain . Inflation remains high and broad -based  across countries . The IMF has projected contractions in over one -third of the global economy .   25. In India, w e have come a long way in the development of financial markets, but this remains  work in progress. The Reserve Bank and stakeholders  like FIMMDA and PDAI need to work together and focus on certain specific areas. Secondary market liquidity in g-secs is concentrated in a few securities and tenors. The MIBOR -based OIS remains the only major liquid product in the interest rate derivative market. A term money market remains absent , notwithstanding a host of facilitative policy measures. Access of the retail segment to markets, 13  especially derivative markets, needs to improve further . In the forex markets, while corporates benefit from the tight bid -ask spreads , smaller users continue to face pricing disadvantages notwithstanding regulatory requirements for fair and transparent pricing.  Likewise, there remains a need for improvement  in ensuring liquidity for retail investors in the government securities markets.    Conclusion  26. The journey of Indian financial markets through the last decade has been a story of steady progress with  stability. We have been steadfast in our commitment and consistent in our approach to keep the ship stable while continuing to move ahead. Going forward, greater challenges will emerge as the footprints of Indian banks increase in the offshore markets, the  range  of product s expand, non-resident participation in domestic markets grows and as capital account convertibility increases. Market participants will have to prepare themselves to manage the changes and the risks associated with globally integrated markets. The achievement of desired outcomes is contingent on financial institutions and market participants taking forward the reform agenda so that we have more vibrant and resilient  financial markets .  Thank you.   ", "11 Sep 09 MP.pdf": "Sustaining growth potentia l \u2013 Focus on key Sectors1 I am privileged to speak before this learned audience at this conclave on the theme of 'Top priorities of the new regime \u2013 Growth strategies'. The topic is of special relevance for emerging economies like ours, particularly in the current context.   As is well recognised, the Indian economy has enormous growth potential, and can be one of the economic powerhous es in the current millennium. The economic dominance of India along with China l ooks all the more likely in view of the shift in the epicentre of growth to emergi ng Asia after the crisis. While concerns about current global turmoil and its impact on macro-economic risks is much talked about and is also relevant, we should not be losing focus from the longer-term issues and agenda  to address the we lfare of our people.   In my address today, I would raise some of  the issues that are relevant to the banking system for sustaining our growth potential. But, before doing that, a brief macro overview could be useful.    The growth rate of 8.8 per cent aver age  in the Indian economy during     2003-08  the highest ever recorded is only next to China, in the contemporary world. The high growth emanated from the upsurge in   domestic savings rate (23.5 per cent in 2001-02 to 37.7 per cent in 2007-08) s upporting the step up in investment rate (from 22.8 per cent to 39.1 per cent) in an  environment of moderate inflation and macro-economic stability. However, cont agion from the global economic crisis brought the growth rate down to 6.7 per c ent in 2008-09 with growth in the second half of 2008-09 at 5.8 per cent largely bec ause of lower export demand and shrinking foreign liquidity. The econom y is unlikely to revert back to trend growth soon, as recession in the advanced economies would per sist with global growth projected to contract by 1.4 per cent by  the IMF with a more sizeable fall in world trade by 12 per cent. The Indian economy is expected to grow by 6 per cent as per the latest                                                  1 Keynote address by Smt. Usha Thorat, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the inaugural session of the \"Conclave of CEOs and CFOs\" organised by Institute of Public Enterprise & NMDC Ltd, CII (AP) & CEO Clubs India at Hyderabad on September 11, 2009. The contribution by Shri Rajib Das in preparing this keynote address  is acknowledged.  2  assessment made by the RBI.  GDP growth in the first quarter of 2009-10 is broadly consistent with that (6.1 per cent).  The current focus is to bring back the economy to the high growth path as a key means to ensure higher living standard for all. The Planning Commission in the Eleventh Five Year Plan Document (2007-12)  identified a number of priorities to fasten an inclusive growth process so that the economy can grow at a rate of around 9 per cent during the plan period. One of t he key requirements of growth is capital formation and for this it is imperative that more and more of household savings are directed to financial savings thereby facilit ating capital formation. Currently financial savings constitute 48.5 of total household savings. If this share is to go up, there is need for much greater penetration of the banking, insurance and capital market products in the country. The policy of financ ial inclusion is ther efore critical for greater capital formation to ensure higher and sustained growth.   I would like to specifically touch upon the issues of ensur ing adequate credit for agriculture, MSME and infrastructure, a ll of which are critic ally important to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth . These are rightly placed as growth engines in the current workshop.   Agriculture  After recording robust and above trend growth during 2003-08, overall agriculture output decelerated during 2008-09 despite a record level of food grains production at 233.9 million t onnes. Higher production was aided by rabi output, while kharif output was affected by floods in some states. Production of coarse cereals, pulses, oilseeds, showed slippage and output  of sugarcane and cotton declined over the year. Diversification of Indian agriculture towards horticulture, livestock and fisheries has been evident for some years wit h their joint share reaching close to 60 per cent of the agriculture and allied GDP. Allied sector is  expected to grow between 5 per cent and 6 per cent during 2008-09. Although there has b een a drop in the share of agriculture in the GDP from 36. 4 per cent in the 1980s to around 17.0 per cent now, the number of people dependent on agricultu re for their food and   3  livelihood remains largel y unchanged at nearly 60 per cent underscoring the importance of agriculture to sustain growth in the country.   Various studies predict that in the long term, the increased demand due to population growth and rising per  capita income, would outstri p the supply of cereals, pulses, edible oil and sugar. Key issues t hat need addressing in this context have been identified as follows. Firstly, irrigat ion is the key to the removal of Indian agriculture\u2019s dependence on the monsoons. T he actual net irrigated area in the country is 62.31 MH, which is only 43% of the net sown ar ea of the country. Secondly, yield comparisons of major crop s over the last 3 decades shows mixed results. While wheat yield has increased fr om 82% to 93% of world average, paddy yield has stagnated and maize yield has dras tically dropped by 98% to 40% of world average. Third, the average size of farm holdings has steadily declined. Out of India\u2019s 116 million farmers, about 60% have less than 1 hectare and together they farm just 17% of the land. Thus, many of the very sm all farms are subsistence holdings with low investment and low productivity. Fourth, the imbalance in the use of nitrogen\u2013phosphorus\u2013potassium (NPK) fert ilizers is creating problem of soil degradation and adversely affect ing productivity. Fifth, the increasing subsidies have suppressed investments.   Gross capital formation in agriculture re lative to agriculture and allied GDP improved slightly from 11.2 per cent in 1999-2000 to 14.2 per cent in 2007-08. The rise is largely contributed by the public sector whose share rose from 6.0 per cent 1999-2000 to 8.2 per cent in 2006-07; t he corresponding share from the private sector fell from 10.2 per cent to 7.0 per cent.   From point of view of agricultural credit, the broad policies followed are:  \u2022 Mandating that 18% of commercial bank credi t is lent to agriculture of which at least 13.5 % has to be for direct agricul ture. Policy of doubling of agricultural credit in three years started in 2004-05. \u2022 With effect from 2006-07, GOI has prov ided interest rate subsidy for crop loans given by public sector banks RRBs and cooperative banks. The rate has been increased from 2% to 3%. Subsidies for the last three years amounted to Rs. 6,019 crore.   4  \u2022 Strengthening of the r egional rural banks and rural cooperative credit structure \u2022 Greater branch expansion in rural and  semi urban areas and encouraging use of intermediaries and IT solutions for greater banking penetration   \u2022 RIDF investments against shortfall of priority sector and weaker section lending. Cumulative disbursement till June 2009 was Rs. 58,041 under the various RIDF since its inception in 1995-96. \u2022 Debt waiver program of the Union Budget fo r 2008-09 resulted in write off of loans for farmers enabling them to re access the banking system    The policies have led to sign ificant increase in share of  agricultural credit to agriculture and allied GDP from  22.7 per cent in 2004-05 to  33.3 per cent in 2008-09. The compounded annual growth rate of agriculture credit  was 28.4 per cent during 2003-08 as compared to 24.5 per cent for overa ll bank credit in this period. The fact that overall private capital formation in agriculture has declined during this period would suggest that most of  the incremental credit has gone for production and not for investment. This is an issue which needs more study to understand the factors that are impeding private capital formation in agriculture. These would be obviously closely linked to the factors identifi ed as impeding growth in agriculture.   Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs)  While non financial factors may be more im portant in the agricultural sector, in the MSE sector, credit is a vital input for growth. As per the data on micro and small enterprises (MSEs) in the An nual Report of Ministry of  Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, 2006-07, the sector accounted for around 39 per cent of total industrial production, 34 per cent of the exports in t he industrial sector and around 35 per cent of total employment among units engaged in manufacturing and services. The sector registered a robust annual average growth in value of output, exports and employment at 16.8 per cent, 20.0 per cent  and 4.4 per cent, respectively during the expansionary phase of 2003-07,  before showing signs of slowing down in 2007-08 particularly in respect of employ ment growth to 2.9 per cent.    5  According to the Annual Report of Mi nistry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, 2006-07,  fixed investment in the sector constituted 37.8 per cent of the value of production from the sector in 2005- 06 (decline sharply fr om 59.9 per cent in 1999-2000 and 51.6 per cent in  2002-03). Credit to the sect or as share of GDP of the sector however rose marginally from 55.0 per cent in 1999-2000 to 56.7 per cent in 2006-07. In terms of ov erall bank credit, credit to MSEs declined from 14.5 per cent in 1999-2000 to 7.2 per cent in 2006-07.  Although  annual growth rate of credit to this sector was more than 20.5 per cent in this period, credit to the system as a whole grew by 30.3 per cent. Share of MS E increased to 11.4 per cent in 2008-09, but this is not comparable with the past data because of definition changes..   The problems cited by MSE borrowers in  obtaining access to bank finance are insistence on collaterals /guarantees, lim ited outreach of banks, rigid approaches, high interest and other costs,  complex document ation, lack of supporting business development services and so on.  From t he banker\u2019s point of view,  the critical factors affecting credit delivery to this sector are low equity base, absence of marketing tie up, diversion of funds, poor management and book keeping, higher NPAs, mounting of receivables due to delay  in payment of bills especially during downturn.    The major policies in regard to cr edit delivery to this sector  \u2022 Measures to increase flow of credit leading to almost three fold increase in the credit to this sector from public sect or banks from Rs.67,600 crore as on March 31, 2005 to Rs.1,90,958 cr ore as on March 31, 2009. \u2022 Inclusion of MSE (as per revised definitio n ) in priority sector with sub limits for the micro units \u2022 Stipulation that collatera l should not be taken for loans up to  Rs.5 lakh to MSE units \u2022 Providing credit guarantee for collateral free loans from t he Credit Guarantee Trust Fund administered by SIDBI  The sector attracted funding from all categories of banks in the boom period 2003-08. As many leading manufacturers in  the automobile and ot her sectors started   6  sourcing their inputs and supplies from th e small enterprises, banks and NBFCs found that lending to such small enterprises was good busi ness. In many cases the banks were already financing the large m anufacturers and could tie up the delivery and recovery mechanism through them. Henc e the model that came to be called invoice financing or channel fi nancing led to surge in credit to the small enterprises. However, at the time of the down turn, t he receivables and inventories piled up with the small units and banks were chary of lendi ng more to them leading to difficulties for many units. It was at this stage that  the GOI and RBI took several measures to ensure holding on operations and support for the units affected. Banks were advised on October 31, 2008 to consider restruct uring of the dues of  MSEs wherever warranted, and continue to disburse loans against the sanctioned limits. Special refinance limits for assisting the MSE sector were introduced and SIDBI was provided a limit of Rs 7000 cr ore. State Level Bankers\u2019  Committee (SLBC) convenor banks were advised to organise special m eetings to address th e problems of the MSE sector. Regional /Zonal Offices of ban ks advised to closely monitor flow of credit to MSEs and also institute a help desk at key centres.   Unlike the larger companies, small enter prises access to capital markets for raising equity and long term funds is limit ed. Further, such units  require handholding and business development and support services in  the initial stages. Very often, they also need assistance to prepare projec t reports and proper accounts. For new ventures without track record, venture capi tal or start up funding  is mostly through friends and relatives and this is an ar ea where the demand far exceeds the supply. Delay in or inadequate working capital ca n derail operations. For dealing with large numbers, banks need bulk risk scoring models and IT capacities. The transaction cost need to be reduced if the overall cost of raising funds has to be reduced. While many banks have specialised branches and schemes for facilitating quick processing and sanctions to the sector, there are huge expectations fr om banks as also several challenges before them.    Infrastructure  The Eleventh Five Year Plan envisages stepping up of the gross capital formation in infrastructure from 5 per cent  of GDP in 2006-07 to 9 per cent of GDP   7  by end of the Plan period in 2011-12, whic h could be critical for achieving the 9 per cent growth. It has estimated an invest ment requirement of  US$ 502.88 billion (Rs.20,11,521 crore) in infras tructure, around 30 per cent (about 6 lakh) of which is expected to be financed by the private sector.    Banks\u2019 exposure to infrastructure l ending has grown nearly fourfold since March 2005, from 6 per cent to about 9.25  percent of bank credit in March 2009. While public investment would dominate the se ctor, the challenge is to attract private funding to this sector. In most countries, infrastructure financing has taken place by the government itself or  with explicit or impl icit guarantees from th e State. To attract private investment, many countries have offered policy guarantees, refinance and maturity extension guarantees, viability gap funding etc. Credit insurance was also provided by monoline insurers.   Multifaceted risks are involved in bank-f unding of infrastructure viz. asset liability mismatches -leading to liquidity and  interest rate risks- which could translate to credit risk, implementation delays leading to cost/ time  over runs, expected cash flows based on use and cost recovery not materialising, financial conditions of ultimate purchaser of the services becoming uncertain despite cash flows being escrowed, concentration risk of too many proj ects being executed by the same group and so on. In India,  implementation risk  and  user charges recovery risk are perceived to be more relevant. Unbundling of  risk through structured products have to be carefully thought through out to avoi d undue leveraging and bu ilding of risk in the banking system or in interconnected entities as the recent global crisis has so eloquently demonstrated.    RBI has provided a number of measures for facilitating infrastructure finance, such as allowing banks to enter into take-out financing arr angement, freedom to issue long term bonds for financing infrastr ucture, some relaxation of single and group borrower limits for additional credit exposur e in infrastructure sector, flexibility to invest in unrated bonds of  companies engaged in  infrastructure activities within the overall ceiling of 10 perc ent of non-SLR securities, excluding from capital market exposure promoters\u2019 shares in the SPV of an infrastructure project, permitting banks to extend finance for fundi ng promoter\u2019s equity where the proposal involves  8  acquisition of share in an existing com pany engaged in implement ing or operating an infrastructure project in India. We have re cently revised the definition of commercial real estate by linking it to source of repayment rather than th e collateral so that hotels hospitals SEZ projects of certain types etc can be classified as not falling under commercial real estate (CRE).   To stimulate public invest ment in infrastructure, a special purpose vehicle - India Infrastructure Finance Company Limit ed (IIFCL) was set up for providing long-term financial assistance to infrastructu re projects. The Union Budget for 2009-10 announced that IIFCL in consultation with banks will evolve \u2018take out financing\u2019 scheme to facilitate lending to the infras tructure sector. To ease the financing constraints for infrastructure projects  under the PPP mode, the Government has decided that IIFCL would refinance 60 pe r cent of commercial bank loans for PPP projects in critical areas over the next fifteen to eighteen months. IIFCL was authorised to raise Rs.10,000 crore thr ough Government guaranteed tax free bonds by the end of 2008-09 and an additional Rs. 30,000 crore on the same basis as per the requirement in 2009-10. The refinancin g option is expected to leverage bank financing for PPP programmes to the extent of about Rs.1,00,000 cr ore.  Given the huge financing requirement of the infrastructure sector , IIFCL needs to assume direct credit risk. Further IIF CL could explore leveraging their capital and budgetary allocation for raising tax free bonds to pr ovide credit enhancements, risk mitigants, back stop liquidity and take out financing thereby attracting more private funding (including bank funding) for infrastructure.    As infrastructure projects are of huge size and are very often executed by few large groups, bank funding is necessari ly limited because of exposure limit requirements. A suggestion sometimes made is  to relax exposure limits \u2013especially the group limit- where the projects are ex ecuted by an entity through an SPV and cash flows emanating from t he project are separately escr owed. Exposure limits for groups are intended to minimise concentration risk. It is difficult to envisage that problems faced by groups will not spill over to the associated entities or vice versa or that the support from the gr oup is not a factor that encouraged the financing in the first instance. In any event the issue is  whether additional risk requires additional safeguards and this is something we are ex amining. Having said that, borrowers too  9  need to accept the fact that their requirements cannot be met by a few banks or banking system and they will have to expl ore syndicated struct ures and corporate bond issuances for their large project requirements.   In this context, it is argued by some t hat for development of corporate bond market, banks should provide credit substi tutes such as guarantees. Experience of other countries, particularly Korea and Ch ina has not been encouraging \u2013 while the former has made its bond market a \u2018no bank guarantee\u2019 market, the latter is stated to be placing curbs on such guaran tees. The current regulator y policies in India do not allow banks to guarantee corporate bonds. There are several reasons for this. Issuance of a tradable b ond with 100 per cent bank guarantee inhibits the development of corporate bond market in m any ways. First, such a product places the entire risk of the exposur e on the banking system and is akin to a bond issued by a bank itself. Second it distorts the pricing of corporate bonds. Thir d, such a practice also discourages institutional and retail inve stors to appraise and assume credit risk.  Any credit enhancement or protection needs to be offered and priced separately. A policy framework for introduction of credit de rivatives is being developed taking into account the lessons learnt from the global crisis.   There is also a view that corporat e bond markets will only develop if RBI allows repos in such bonds. At the outset it must be recognised that development of the long term corporate bond requires long te rm institutional investors such as insurance companies and pensi on funds.  Several measures  are being taken by the Government to promote insurance and pens ion sectors. While , to some extent banks can undertake the maturity transforma tion, to mitigate the risk of such transformation beyond acceptable limits, the on ly option is for government itself or government entities like IIFCL to provide appropriate risk mitigants till natural long term institutional investors emerge in a big way.   To come back to repos in corporate bonds, RBI has already set out the pre-conditions for allowing repos in corpor ate bonds: viz., an efficient and safe settlement system based on DvP and availability of fair pr ices. The permission to the clearing houses of the exchanges to open a transitory pooling ac count with the RBI is the first step taken to provide an envir onment for an efficient and safe settlement   10  system. Draft guidelines for allowing repos in corporate bonds will be placed shortly on RBI\u2019s website for wider dissemination and comments.  Take out financing is one method of addr essing the ALM issue. Some argue that take out financing has not worked because of the hi gher capital requirements that needs to be maintained, both by the fi nancial entity offering the asset for takeout as also the bank financing the infrastructu re. In case of organisations like IIFCL offering take out, this should not be an issue.  However we are having a relook at this constraint.    Issuance of long term bonds by banks with special incentives for investors is another suggestion that is made for addressing the problem of asset liability mismatch. While this is being examined, it  needs to be mentioned that the recent introduction of the 10 year future on t he exchanges can perhaps help in developing products to mitigate the interest rate  risk for infrastructure projects.    To conclude, there is need to address the non credit issu es in agricultural credit , credit and credit plus issues in MSE fin ancing and a variety of innovative risk mitigants in infrastructure financing to make  sure that the Indian banking system can play  its due role in capital formation in these three vital sectors of the economy so critical for sustainable inclusive growth.   _______________ References: Reserve Bank of India (2009): Annual Report Planning Commission (2008): 11th Five Year Plan -2007-12  Government of India (2009): Economic Survey, 2008-09, Ministry of Finance Government of India (2009): Annual Report , Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises    ", "31 July 09 MP.pdf": "Global Financial Crisis   Questioning the Questions1 By Duvvuri Subbarao _________________________________________________________ JRD Tata  Thank you for inviting me to deliver  this year\u2019s JRD Tata Memorial Lecture. It is an honour to which I attach a lo t of value. The ma n whose life this series of lectures commemorates, JRD Tata - or JRD, as he was known - left a great legacy as a visionary, as an industry leader , as a philanthropist, and above all as a humanist. 2.  Two words capture JRD\u2019s lasting contribution, nation builder . His commitment to India\u2019s development was deep and abiding, and he was passionate about improving the lot of the less privil eged. S.A. Sabavala, one of JRD\u2019s long-time associates, tells a story that illustrates this passi on.  After picking up Mother Teresa in Jamshedpur once, JRD spoke gene rally about poverty in India, how it upset him, when it would end and so on. Her reply, \u201cMr. Tata, your job is to open more industries, give more employment to people, and leave the rest to God.\u201d 3. JRD evidently took the Mother\u2019s advice to h eart.  Starting with 14 enterprises at the start of his business career, JRD retired in 1988 with a conglomerate of 95 enterprises that pr ovided steady employment to hundreds of                                                  1 JRD Tata Memorial Lecture delivered at the me eting of The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, New Delhi on July 31, 2009.  thousands.  Tata businesses ranged from air lines to hotels, trucks to locomotives, heavy chemicals to pharmaceuticals and fina ncial services, tea and air conditioning, becoming a household name. 4. We in the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI) are proud of a special connection with JRD. He was a Director on the RBI\u2019s Central Board for three terms - from 1952 to 1964. There are countless stories a bout JRD\u2019s humanism, determination, old world charm and everyday courtesies. The Reserve Bank has its own share.  I will share one quick anecdote that sums up the measure of this remarkable man. RBI board meetings at that time were held  on the first floor in the old building. When meetings would break around lunch time, JRD would join the line of RBI staffers waiting to take the elevator. JRD always insisted that the staff go ahead of him, telling the lift man: \u201cThese boys ar e hungry, and they have to eat and then come back to work. Please drop them off first.\u201d Old timers of RBI, almost all of them now retired, recall se veral occasions when JRD showed unaffected empathy.  5. There is a similar fount of stories about JRD\u2019s visionary leadersh ip in tough times, and his astute unders tanding of what could driv e the future, and how to always keep ahead of the curve. He was a good listener, but he always asked penetrating and insightful questions, questioning even the ques tions that others asked.   6. Today we pay tribute to that amazing individual, a Bharat Ratna, and his rare capability to question the questions. Very often, as king the right question is even more important even than having th e right answer. JRD\u2019 s insights underpin  2my speech today: I will question the que stions that people are asking about the financial crisis, its impact a nd our approach to recovery.  The Global Crisis  7. We are going through what is by all acc ounts the deepest economic crisis of our time. Economic historians are comparing this crisis to the Great Depression of the 1930s. Both were global in scope,   bot h were centred in the United States, and importantly both were preceded by mounti ng global imbalances, loose monetary policy and high levels of leverage.   8. Still, there are important differences  between the Great Recession of today and the Great Depression and all the crises  in between. A number of regions of the world - Latin America and Asia - and a number of individual countries such as Argentina, Mexico, Russia, Turkey - had all gone through crises, and these crises were essentially traditional retail banki ng and currency crises. During these crises richer countries buffered the fall bailing ou t the troubled regions. In contrast, the current crisis hit at the very heart of gl obal finance with no buffer to fall back on. Some studies suggest that th e net worth impact of this crisis, when measured by variables such as declines in output, tr ade volumes and stock markets, has arguably been more severe than that of the Great Depression.   9. Every country in every part of the world has been affected by the crisis, although through different channels and to different degrees. The United States and Europe, which had become dependent on the financial sector as their engine of growth, were at the very epicentre of the crisis. Export growth led Asia, which  3managed its external sector cautiously after the Asian Crisis of a decade ago, saw its growth plummet through a sharp declin e in the demand for exports. Over the years, Eastern Europe had become dependent  on large-scale cap ital imports through banking channels and was therefore hit by th e reversal of capital flows.  African and South American economies suffered through the huge drop in commodity prices and deterioration in their terms of  trade. In India, our financial markets continued to function normally, and our financial sector remained healthy. Even so, we too were hit by sudden cap ital flow reversals as part of the global deleveraging process and the liquidity hiccups tran smitted mainly through the confidence channel.  10. The point here is that almost every country around the world has been impacted by this crisis.   11. Text book economics tells us that stress es in non-tradable  sectors remain confined to economic boundaries. Many text books also cite housing as a quintessential example of a non-tradable good.  It is paradoxical therefore that a problem that, at some level, traces its or igins to pressures in the US sub-prime housing market should snowball into a crisis of such global dimensions. This only demonstrates the power of globalization, which is now increa singly encompassing sectors long consid ered non-tradable through grow ing communication linkages, capital flows and the depth of financial e ngineering - three aspects that lie at the heart of this crisis.   412. A lot is being written about how this crisis is too important to waste, how we should learn the lessons of this cr isis and go forward with Schumpeterian creative destruction. Some people have , however, questioned the wisdom of drawing lessons when the immediate challe nge is to pull the wo rld economy out of its tailspin. When Chairman Mao was asked what he thought of the French Revolution, he said it was too early to say. People who take a l ong view of history as did Chairman Mao would say that it is too premature to talk about the lessons of the crisis. Of course, this crisis is by no means over. There may yet be surprises. So, is it too early to  raise questions?   13. I believe it is not. The world is chan ging too rapidly to allow us the luxury of sitting back until after the crisis has pa ssed to investigate its causes and draw key lessons. Indeed the situatio n is so complex, compelling and urgent that we cannot effectively resolve it unless we  start looking at everything de novo .  14. This crisis has also been an inte llectual challenge. It has thrown up a number of issues that we believed were  behind us, reopened questions that we thought were answered, renewed debates th at we had assumed were settled and attacked stereotype views that we had accep ted without questioning.  Out of all this churning, lessons are being drawn and applied to polic y and institutional reform. While this earnestness is welcome, there is a risk that we may be learning the wrong lessons because we are asking the wr ong questions. That we need to ask the right question to get the righ t answers is self evident,  even tautological. What I  5propose to do therefore in my lecture toda y is to question the questions in four crisis related areas addressing them in th e global context and the Indian context.  Global Imbalances 15. The first issue relates to global imbalan ces. No crisis as complex as this has a simple or a single cause. In popular pe rception, the coll apse of Lehman Brothers in mid-September 2008 will remain marked as the trigger of the crisis. At one level that may well be true. Indeed, I can visual ize future text books in finance dividing the world into \u2018before Lehman\u2019 and \u2018after Lehman\u2019. But if we probe deeper, we will learn that at the heart of the crisis were two root causes - the build up of global imbalances and developments in the financial markets over the last two decades. And received wisdom today is that these two root causes are interconnected, and that financial market developments were in a sense driven by the global imbalances.   16. Global macro imbalances got built up because of the large savings and current account surpluses in China and much of Asia in wake of the East Asian Crisis a decade ago. These were mirro red by large increases in leveraged consumption and current account deficits in  the US. In short, Asia produced and America consumed. There is a raging debate  on what was the cause, and what the effect - the US consumption boom and th e Asian savings glut? Regardless, the bottom line is that one was simply the mirror of the other and the two share a symbiotic relationship.   617. And how did these imbalances build up?  The answer lies in globalization - globalization of trade, of labour and of finance. The world witnessed a phenomenal expansion in global trade over the last 50  years; global trade as a proportion of global GDP more than doubled from 24 pe r cent in 1960 to 57 per cent in 2006, just before the crisis hit us. Globalization of finance was even more prolific, especially over the last decade. For the world taken together, the ratio of foreign assets and foreign liabiliti es to GDP rose from 45 pe r cent in 1970 to over 300 per cent in 2004.2 The impact of globalization of labour was by far more striking. Emerging Asia added nearly three billi on to the world\u2019s pool of labour as it integrated with the rest of the worl d over the last two decades thus hugely improving its comparative advantage. Together the three dimensions of globalization - trade, finance and labour - helped emerging Asia multiply by a factor its exports to the a dvanced economies. The result  was large and persistent current account surpluses in the Asia n economies and corresponding current account deficits in the im porting advanced economies.  18. The chain of causation from these imba lances to the financial crisis is interesting although not obvious . As Asia accumulated sa vings and simultaneously maintained competitive exchange rates, the savings turned into central bank reserves. Central banks, in turn, invested th ese savings not in a ny large, diversified portfolio but in government bonds of the a dvanced economies. This in turn drove down risk free real interest rates to histor ically low levels triggering phenomenal                                                  2 Philip R. Lane and Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti (2006 ), \u201cThe External Wealth of Nations Mark II: Revised and Extended Estimates of Foreign A ssets and Liabilities, 1970-2004\u201d, Working Paper WP/06/69, International Monetary Fund.  7credit expansion and dropping of the guard  on credit standards,  erosion of credit quality and search for yield, all of whic h combined to brew the crisis to its explosive dimensions.    19. Where did India stand in all this? India did not contribute to global imbalances. Indeed we ran current account deficits for the last  two decades except for a brief period during 2001-04. In other words, we imported savings, did not export them.  However, India\u2019s integration with the rest of the world over the last decade has been remarkably rapid. First, let us look at trade integration. The two way trade (merchandize exports plus im ports) as a proportion of GDP doubled from 20 per cent in 1998/99, ju st after the Asian crisis, to 41 per cent in 2008/09. Our financial integration was even deeper as measured by the proportion of total external transactions (gross current flows plus gross capital flows) to GDP. This ratio much more than doubled from 44 per cent in 1998/99 to 112 per cent in 2008/09. While the crisis transmitted to India through both the trade and finance channels, the latter was by fa r more significant in terms of the intensity of impact.  20. Notwithstanding reams being written a bout resolving the present crisis and preventing another like this, global imbalan ces are not on the radar screen of policy debate. This is both perplexing and dist urbing. Indeed, once the immediacy of the crisis is behind us, it will not be surprising if we head for another round of destabilizing global imbalances.    21. How do we manage global imbalances? It  is argued that if the US Fed had refused to supply the incipient demand for liquidity in the late 1990s and early  82000s, higher interest rates could have  prevented the borrowing boom and the follow on widespread deterioration of fina ncial standards and the subsequent melt down. But this also would have meant lower growth in the US and the rest of the world. The short point is that even as macroeconomic imbalances should not be allowed to proliferate, it is necessary to balance the need for global economic growth against the disruptions which follow the unwinding of such imbalances.  22. Resolving the problem of global imbalances does not mean eliminating them. As long as there is world trade, certain countries will have surpluses and certain others will run deficits. Global imbalances have been, are, and will continue to be inevitable.   23. So, to ask how we can eliminate gl obal imbalances is clearly the wrong question. The right question is this: given that global imbalances are inevitable, how do we ensure that they do not build up to destabilizing levels?  Monetary & Fiscal Policy 24. The second issue on questioning the questions relates to monetary and fiscal policy. Unnerved by the scale and sweep of the crisis, governments and central banks around the world responded with an unprecedented show of policy force. The size and pace of monetary and fiscal expansion raised a pa radoxical situation - even as governments and central banks coordinated and cooperated, many of their familiar conflicts got played out once again.   925. Central banks reduced policy rates ferociously, and in many advanced countries the rates are at or near zero. This is the standa rd tool of monetary policy whereby central banks expect to influence interest rates at the long end, and steer financial conditions and hence the entire economy by adjusting the short term rates. Even in normal times, monetary policy transmission is lagged. In the crisis situation, because of the fear and uncertain ty in the financial markets, it almost totally lost traction. Central banks res ponded to this alarming impasse through a slew of measures vari ously described as quant itative and credit easing.  26. It soon became clear that even as m onetary policy became the first line of defence and central banks turned lenders of  first resort, credit markets were in no mood to revive soon. So, governments had to step in with huge fiscal packages to stimulate domestic demand a nd to recapitalize banks.   27. Fiscal deficits have ballooned around the world to levels  never seen in peace time. In the US, the fiscal deficit (g eneral government balance) is projected to rise from 2.2 per cent in 2006 to 13.6 per cent in 2009; in the UK, from 2.6 per cent (2006) to 10.9 per cent (2010); and, in the euro area, from 1.2 per cent (2006) to 6.1 per cent (2010). Public debt of the te n leading rich countries is projected to jump from 78 per cent in 2007 to 106 per cent in 2010 and further to 114 per cent in 2014. \u201cWe are all Keynesians now\u201d, as President Nixon once remarked.  28. Financing these fiscal deficits has not been a problem so far. The extreme risk aversion in the wake of the crisis triggered \u2018flight to safety\u2019 and \u2018flight to liquidity\u2019 which, in turn, ensured that there was enough appetite for treasuries.  10Even so, yields on treasuries have started firming up in recent weeks suggesting the return of some risk appetite. Central banks are showing extr aordinary monetary accommodation by pumping in huge amounts of  liquidity to support banks and financial institutions. This has willy-nilly helped governments raise borrowings.   29. Governments are likely to be forced to pay back for this support. Central banks\u2019 balance sheets have expanded at a furious pace. The US Fed balance sheet, for example, expanded from $919 billion at end June 2008 to $2 trillion by end June 2009.  The reserves of banks with the Fed jumped twenty times from less than $33 billion as at end June 2008 to $661 billion by end June 2009. Should the central bank\u2019s interest income fall short of its interest payment obligations, it will have to fall back on fiscal support for interest paymen ts, reversing the dependency equation between the government and the central bank.   30. Many believe that these tensions be tween fiscal and monetary policy are temporary, and will melt away once the crisis has passed. That is  unlikely to be the case. On the contrary, fiscal deficits in  advanced economies are likely to persist, and in fact, increase on the way forward for at least two reasons. First, since it will take some years for households to rebuild their balance sheets which got ruptured by the crisis, economic growth will likely be  weak for some years necessitating big fiscal deficits. Even so, since this deficit will be of a cyclical nature, it can possibly be managed. However, the second and a bigger fiscal concern stems from the demographic profile of the advanced ec onomies. As more people age, dependency ratios increase and social security paymen ts mount, governments will have to resort  11to big deficits on a long term basis to meet these obligations.  Moreover if the surplus Asian economies make the necessary  adjustment, they will move away from funding the fiscal deficits of advan ced economies.  In other words, monetary policy will have to be conduc ted in a regime of large and continuing structural fiscal deficits.   31. How are the tensions between fiscal and monetary policies playing out in India? Here, even as the Government and the Reserve Bank coordinated their crisis management efforts, there are dilemmas.  Last year (2008/09), the government launched three fiscal stimulus packages which came on top of an already announced expanded safety-net programme for the rural poor, the farm loan waiver package and pay out following the impleme ntation of the Sixth Pay Commission. Together all these commitments raised the fiscal deficit from 2.5 per cent estimated in the budget to 6.2 per cent (as per pre-actu al figures) by the close of the year.  The budget for 2009/10 projects a fiscal deficit of 6.8 per cent of GDP.   32. For its part, the Reserve Bank sharply reversed its monetary stance from tightening to easing following the full out break of the crisis in September 2008. The monetary stimulus came through a shar p reduction in the policy interest rates and the cash reserve ratio (CRR), reduced  pre-emption of bank resources through the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) and expa nsion of refinance f acilities for banks some of which were sector specific. The potential liquidity made available by the Reserve Bank as a result of  these measures amounted to Rs.560,000 crores, nearly 9 per cent of GDP.  12 33. The countercyclical spending by the government and the accommodative monetary policy of the Reserve Bank were both necessary in order to cushion the economy from the onslaught of the crisis . Nevertheless, the sudden and rapid expansion of government borrowing programme has impeded monetary transmission.  Last year, the final net government borrowing was two and a half times the original budget estimate. This yea r\u2019s budgeted borrowing is going to be at least a third higher than that. The intent  behind Reserve Bank\u2019s monetary easing was to encourage banks to reduce lending ra tes and maintain the flow of credit to the productive sectors.  But government borrowing had resulted in firming up of yields, notwithstanding the substantial ex cess liquidity, militating against the low interest rate regime  that we want.   34. The huge government borrowing progr amme demanded active liquidity management by the Reserve Bank, and we responded by way of open market operations (OMO). For the first time we  put out the programme for the OMO along with the programme for borrowing so as  to reduce uncertainty and infuse confidence in the market. This year again, the Reserve Bank will have to manage the delicate balance between governm ent borrowing and maintaining ample liquidity to meet the demand for private cred it as it picks up in the months ahead. We will follow the same open, transparent a nd consultative process as we did last year.    35. Going forward, we need to tread  the balance betw een short term compulsions and medium term sustainabi lity with care and good judgement. In the  13short term, the countercyclical public sp ending was necessary; the important point here is to spend that money quickly, effec tively and to create durable assets. On the monetary side, the increased fiscal deficit is going to pose more than a proportionate challenge. Creation of high pow er money in the face of large fiscal deficits, even if there is no direct primar y financing, is not costless; it can sow the seeds of the next inflati onary cycle. The challenge for the Reserve Bank is to maintain a comfortable liquidity situa tion while at the same time anchoring inflation expectations.   36. The current monetary and fiscal stan ce is, however, not the steady state. The Reserve Bank needs to roll back the speci al monetary accommodation. For this to happen, there are two necessary conditions. Fi rst, the government will have to show a firm and credible commitment to fiscal  responsibility by fleshing out the road map for fiscal consolidation. Second, there will have to be more definite signs of recovery. The Reserve Bank will maintain  an accommodative stance until demand conditions improve and credit flow takes hold, but reversing the expansionary policies is definitely on the agenda on the way forward.  37. Having explained the Indian context in some detail, let me now return to the global scene. The seventy odd years sin ce the Great Depression saw a famous rivalry between fiscal and monetary polic ies for influence. The crisis has shown that both are required, and that ind eed both are critical for macroeconomic stabilization. It is unlikely that we will re vert to status quo ante once the crisis has passed. On the contrary, there will need  to be increasing coordination between  14monetary and fiscal policies. Central banks  will have to take into account fiscal compulsions in their monetary stance while governments will need to commit to strict fiscal responsibility. To ask theref ore how monetary and fiscal policies can go their separate ways is the wrong question. What is the right question? I submit the right question is:  how can we coordinate fiscal and monetary policies to achieve the planned outcomes?    Inflation Targetting 38. I will now move to the th ird issue -  inflation targ etting. In the years leading to the crisis, central bankers had nearly declared victory. They had found the holy grail of stable growth, low inflation a nd low unemployment through a rule based monetary policy that targeted inflation ra ther than monetary aggregates. The much celebrated Great Moderation had delivered.   39. The crisis at once hurt the central  bankers\u2019 pride and shattered their confidence as the Great Moderation unr avelled. Monetary policy was found wanting in delivering financ ial stability. The undoing was the reluctance or failure of central banks to acknowle dge increasing asset prices.   40. The monetary stance of studied i ndifference to asset price inflation stemmed from the now notoriously famous Greenspan orthodoxy which can be summarized as follows. First,  asset price bubbles are hard to identify on a real time basis, and the fundamental factors that  drive asset prices  are not directly observable. Second, monetary pol icy is too blunt an instru ment to counteract asset price booms. And third, a central bank cannot presume to know more than the  15market.  The surmise therefore was that th e cost-benefit calculus of a more activist monetary stance of \u201cleaning against the wind \u201d was clearly negative. It is more cost effective for monetary policy to wait for the bubble to burst and clean up afterwards rather than prick the bubble in advance.   41. The Great Unravelling has, however, shattered the intellectual consensus around both inflation targeting and the Gr eenspan orthodoxy on asset price build up. The crisis has made two things clear. Fi rst, the policy of be nign neglect of asset price build up has failed. Second, price stability does not necessarily deliver financial stability.   42. Where do we in India stand on inflation targetting? Over the last few years, there has been an animated debate in India on inflation targ eting fuelled by two influential studies, one by Percy Mistry  and the other by Raghuram Rajan. While Mistry strongly urged that the gold stan dard for stabilizing monetary policy is a transparent, independent, inflation-targetting central bank, Rajan held that reorienting RBI towards inflation targetting will have to dovetail with the government\u2019s commitment to maintain fis cal discipline and not hold the central bank accountable for either the level or the volatility of the nominal exchange rate.  43. The debate on inflation targetting in  India has to some extent been overtaken by the learnings from the crisis. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile noting that inflation targetting is neither desirabl e nor practical in India for a variety of reasons. I will defer a detailed exposition on this issue to another forum; I will allude here only to th e important reasons.   16 \u2022 First, it is inconceivable that in an emerging economy like India, the central bank can drive a single goal oblivious of the larger development context. The Reserve Bank must be guided simultaneously by the objectives of price stability, financial stability and growth.   \u2022 Second, food items which have a large weight (46 - 70 per cent) in the various consumer prices indices are vulnerable to  large supply shocks, especially because of the vagaries  of the monsoon, and are therefore beyond the pale of monetary policy. An inflation targeting RBI cannot do much to tame a supply driven infl ation except as a line of defence in an extreme situation.   \u2022 Third, which inflation index do we target? In India,  we have one wholesale price index and four consumer price indices. There are ongoing efforts at a technical level to reduce the number of consumer price indices, and I believe the tech nical issues are not insurmountable. But that still will not give us a single representative inflation rate for an emerging market economy with market imperfections, diverse geography and 1.1 billion people.  \u2022 Fourth, the monetary transmission mechanism in India is impeded because of the large fiscal deficits, persistence of administered interest rates and illiquid private bond market s. Inflation targetting can be  17efficient and effective only after monetary transmission becomes streamlined.  \u2022 Finally, we need to manage the m onetary fall-out of  volatile capital flows that queer the pitch for a single focus monetary policy. A boom-bust pattern of capital flows can lead to large disorderly movements in exchange rates rendering both inflati on targeting and financial stability vulnerable. Like other emerging economies, India too will have to navigate the impossible trinity as best as it can.   44. In a more global context, given the fall out from the crisis, to ask how central banks should revert to their sole inflation targeting ma ndate is the wrong question. The right question is this: what ar e the specific roles and responsibilities of governments and central banks in ensuring price stability, financial stability and macroeconomic stability?   Real Sector and Financial Sector   45. Finally, I want to address questions  around the interplay between the real sector and the financial sector. One of th e silent, albeit influential, developments leading to the crisis was th e hubris that came to surround the financial sector. There were two factors behind the financial se ctor's growth in size, importance, and influence. The first was the ferocious s earch for yield, enge ndered by the easy liquidity in the global syst em that triggered a wave  of financial innovation. Complex financial products were created by slicing and dicing,  structuring and hedging, originating and distributing, all unde r the belief that real value could be  18created by sheer financial engineering.  Th e second factor was the razzle dazzle of sophisticated maths applied to financ ial modelling. The premium was not on models that captured the stru ctural properties of the ma rket but rather on models that best fitted market prices, never mind  if those prices were way out of line on any fundamental analysis.    46. In the world that existed before the crisis - a benign global environment of easy liquidity, stable growth and low infl ation - profits kept coming, and everyone got lulled into a false sense of security in the firm belief that profits will keep rolling in forever.  Herb Stein, an economist, pointed out the truism that, \"if something cannot go on for ever, it will eventually stop.\"  But no one paid attention. Indeed, as Chuck Prince, the former Chief of Citigroup said, it was necessary to keep dancing as along as th e music was on. The magic of the financial sector gave it such a larger than life profile that we began to believe that for every real life problem, no matter how  complex, there is a financ ial sector solution.  Now, of course, we know better \u2013 for every real  life problem, no matter how complex, there is a financial sector solution, which is wrong.  47. Take the case of the United States. Over  the last 50 years, the share of value added from manufacturing in GDP shrank by more than half from 25.3 per cent to 11.5 per cent while the share of financia l sector more than doubled from 3.6 per cent to 7.5 per cent.  The job share of th e manufacturing sector declined by more than half from 28.5 per cent to 10.5 per cen t while the job share of the financial sector increased by ove r a third from 3.5 per cent to 4.6 per cent. The same trend is  19reflected in profits too. Over the last 50 years, the share of manufacturing sector profits in total prof its declined by more than half from 49.3 per cent to 20.6 per cent while the share of profits of the fina ncial sector increase d by more than half from 17.4 per cent to 26.6 per cent. Clearly, the excessive risk-taking behaviour of the financial sector raised the value-adde d of the sector beyond a sustainable level making the melt down, in retrospect, inevitable.   48. Forgotten in the euphoria of financia l alchemy is the basic tenet that the financial sector has no standing of its ow n; it derives its strength and resilience from the real economy.  It is the real sect or that should drive the financial sector, not the other way round.   49. This thought is also a convenient place to introduce my last point, namely financial sector regulations. In the co ming months and years, how the world regulates the financial sector will change  dramatically. The US, for example, has already put out a framework that charts si gnificant changes from the existing model of financial regulation.   50. In India, we too will have to address this issue sooner or later. However, our problem is a little different since we must  regulate markets in a way that does not hamper development. But whose development do we focus on? As I have argued, what is important is the development of th e real sectors not of the financial sector. To the extent that the financial sector he lps deliver stronger a nd more secure long-term growth, its development is import ant. And our regulatory framework should be premised on this underlying argument.  So, as we change or review our  20regulatory framework, the question we need to answer is whether an existing practice or a change in rule delivers higher and more secure real economy growth; not whether it develops the financial sector or accelera tes its expansion.  51. All in all, this crisis has dealt a harsh blow to our confidence in the financial sector.  But are we asking the right ques tion? The question we are asking is how to put the financial sector back  on the high growth trajectory.  I believe we must be asking a different question, so that we can come up with effective and lasting solutions. That question is:  how can we  keep real sector growth on a high trajectory? And only in this connection, should we ask what  the financial sector can do to help.   Conclusion 52. That brings me to the conclusion of  my lecture. To summarize, I have argued that in order to learn and apply the right lessons fr om the crisis we must, in the spirit of the man whose legacy we honour today, question the questions. I am conscious that the list of  issues I have chosen is  by no means comprehensive. Expanding that list and extending our collective understanding of the right questions to ask is a shared task for all of us. Finally, I want to thank the ASSOCHAM once again for inviting me to deliver the JRD Tata Memorial Lecture. It has meant a lot to me.  21", "20 June 16 MP.pdf": "1  The fight against inflation: a measure of our institutional development1 I thank the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research for inviting me to give this Foundation Day lecture. I have always seen TIFR with awe from afar. Some explanation is in order. My roommate in my firs t year at MIT was Dr. Renganathan Iyer, who i s one of the smartest mathematicians I know  \u2013 he used to help me understand my tutorials in real analysis . And he never missed an occasion to tell me how much smarter everyone else at TIFR was . Perhaps Renga was being modest, but I half expected on coming here today to see everyone with gigantic heads housing enormous brains. It is a relief to find that, outwardly, you all look normal. Seriously, however, I think the continuing success of TIFR suggests to us that when India wants to set up world class institutions, it can. While the Institute was fortunate to have a visionary like Dr. Homi Bhabha as its founding director, the institution has been built by the collective efforts of dedicated rese archers like you all . Congratulations on a job well done!  In my speech today, I thought I would describe  our efforts to build a different kind of institution, not one that delves into the deepest realms of outer space or into the tiniest constituents of an atom, but one that attempts to control something th at affects your daily life;  inflation. There are parallels between the institution building you have done, and what we are setting up to control inflation, though clearly our efforts are m uch less tied to  investigating the very fabric of the universe and more to wards  influencing human behavior . Ultimately, both require a fundamental change in mindset.  The Costs of Inflation  High i nflation has been with us  in India for the last four decades . Most recently , we have experienced an average of more than 9 percent inflation between 2006 and 2013 .  What are the costs of having high inflation? Clearly, everyone understands the costs of hyper -inflation, when prices are rising every minute. M oney is then a hot potato  that no one wants to hold, with people rushing straight from the bank to the shops to buy goods in case their money loses value along the way. As people lose faith in money, barter of goods for goods or services becomes the norm, making transacting significantly more difficult ; How much of a physics lecture would you have to pay a taxi driver to drive you to Bandra ; moreover would the taxi driver accept a physics lecture in payment ; perhaps you would have to lecture a student, and get the student to sing to the taxi driver\u2026you get the point, transacting becomes difficult as hyperinflation renders money worthless.  Hyperinflation also has redistributive effects , destroying the middle class\u2019 savings held in bonds and deposits . The horrors of hyperinflat ion in Austria and Germany in the 1920s still make scary reading.    So clearly, no one wants hyperinflation. But what if inflation were only 15 percent per year? Haven\u2019 t countries grown fast over a period of time despite high inflation? The answer is yes,  but perhaps they could have grown faster with low inflation.2 After all, the variability of inflation increases with its level, as does the dispersion of prices  from their fundamental value in the economy. This makes price signa ls more confusing \u2013 is the price of my widget going up because of high demand or because of high generalized inflation? In the former case, I can sell more if I produce more, in the latter case I will be left wi th unsold inventory . Production and investment therefore become more ris ky.                                                              1 Foundation Day Lecture of Dr. Raghuram G. Rajan, Governor, Reserve Bank of India, at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, June 20, 2016,  Mumbai.  2 In fact, i n a seminal paper, Fischer (1993) presents cross -country evidence to show that growth is negati vely associated with inflation, and the causality runs from inflation to growth.   2  Moreover, high and variable inflation cause s lenders to demand a higher fixed interest rate to compensate for the risk that inflation will move around (the so -called inflation risk premium), thu s raising the cost of finance. The l ong term nominal (and  real) interest rates savers require rise s, thus making some long-duration projects prohibitively costly.     These effects kick in o nly when inflation is noticeably high . So it is legitimate to ask , \u201cAt what threshold level of inflation does it start hurt ing growth?\u201d Unfortunately, this question is hard to answer \u2013 developing countries typically have higher inflation, and developing countries also have higher growth. So one might well find a positive correlation between inflation and growth, though this does not mean more inflation causes more growth. For this reason, the literature on estimating threshold effects beyond which inflation hurts growth is both vast as well as inconclusive. Most studies find that double digit inflat ion is  harmful for growth  but are fuzzier about where in the single digit s the  precise threshold lies.3  The Inflation Target  Nevertheless, given the limited evidence, why do most countries set their inflation goal in the low single digits  \u2013 2 to 5 percent rather than 7 to 10 percent ? Three reasons come to mind. First, even if inflation is at a moderate level that does not hurt overall growth, the consequences of inflation are not evenly distributed . While higher inflation might help a rich,  highly indebted, industrialist  because his d ebt comes down relative to sales revenues, it hurts the poor daily wage worker, whose wage is not indexed to inflation.4 Second, hi gher inflation is more variable. This raises the chanc e of breaching any given range around the target if it is set at a high er level.  To the extent that a higher  target is closer to the threshold, this makes it more likely the country will exceed the threshold and experience lower g rowth. Third, inflation could  feed on itself at higher levels \u2013  the higher the target, the more c hances of entering regions where inflation  spirals upwards .  The received wisdom in monetary economics today is therefore that a central bank serves the economy and the cause of growth best by keeping inflation low and stable around the target it is given by the government. This contrasts with the earlier prevailing view in economics  that by pumping up demand through dramatic interest rate cuts, the central bank could generate sustained growth, albeit with some inflation. That view proved hopelessly optimis tic about the powers of the central bank.  There is indeed a short run trade-off between inflation and growth. In layman\u2019s terms, if the central bank cuts the interest rate by 100 basis points today, and banks pass it on, then demand will pick up and we cou ld get stronger growth for a while, especially if economic players are surprised. The stock market may shoot up for a few days. But  you can fool all of the people only some of the time. I f the economy is producing at potential , we w ould quickly see shortages and a sharp rise in inflation. People will also start expecting the central bank to disregard inflation (that is, be hopelessly dovish according to the bird analogies that abound)  and embed high inflationary expectations into their decisions , including their demand for higher wages . If contrary to expectations, the central bank is                                                             3 For example, Bruno and Easterly (1995) suggest 40 percent as a danger point, beyond which increases in inflation are very likely to lead to a growth crisis. In contrast, K han and Senhadji (2000) estimate that the threshold above which inflation significantly slows growth is 1 -3 percent for industrial countries and 7- 11 percent for developing countries.   4 According to Easterly and Fischer (2001), \u201ca growing body of literat ure on balance \u2014but not unanimously\u2014tends to support the view that inflation is a cruel tax\u201d.   3  committed to keeping inflation under control, it may then be forced to raise interest rates substantially to offset that temporary growth. The boom and bust will not be good for the economy, and average growth may be lower than if the cut had not taken place. This is why modern economics also says there is no long run trade-off between growth and inflation \u2013  the best way for a central bank to ensure sustainable growth is to keep demand clo se to potential supply so that inflation remains moderate, and the other factors that drive growth , such as good governance,  can take center stage .5  Put differently, when people say \u201cInflation is low, you can now turn to stimulating growth\u201d, they really do not understand that these are two s ides of the same coin. The RBI always sets the policy rate as low as it can, consistent with meeting its inflation objective. Indeed, the fact that inflation is fairly close to the upper bound of our target  zone today suggests we have not been overly hawkish, and were wise to disregard advice in the past to cut more deeply. If a critic believes interest rates are excessively high, he either has to argue the government -set inflation target should be higher th an it is today, or that the RBI is excessively pessimistic about the path of future inflation. He cannot have it both ways, want lower inflation as well as lower policy rates.   At the same time, the RBI does  not focus on inflation to the exclusion of grow th. If inflation rises sharply, for instance, because of a sharp rise in the price of oil, it would not be sensible for a  central bank to bring inflation within its target band immediately by raising interest rates so high as to kill all economic activity.  Instead, it makes sense to bring inflation back under control over the medium term, that is , the next two years or so, by raising rate s steadily to the point where the bank  thinks  it would be enough to bring inflation back within the target range. Let me emphasize that this is not a prediction of either the path of oil prices or a forecast of our monetary actions, lest I read in the paper tomorrow \u201cRBI to raise rates\u201d.  More generally, t he extended glide path over which we are bringing inflation in check a ppropriately balances inflation and the need for reasonable growth.  Arguments against what we are doing  There are many who believe we are totally misguided in our actions. Let me focus on four  criticisms. First, we focus on the wrong index of inflation . Second, we have killed private investment  by keeping rates too high. Somewhat contradictorily, we are also hurting the pensioner by cutting rates too sharply. Third , monetary policy has no effects on inflation when the economy is supply constrained, so we sh ould abandon our attempt to control it. Fourth, the central bank has little control over inflation when government spending dominates (what in the jargon is called \u201cfiscal dominance\u201d).  The Wrong Index  Historically, the RBI targeted a variety of indicators, putting a lot of weight on the Wholesale Price Inflation (WPI) . Theoretically, reliance on WPI has  two problems. First, wha t the common citizen experiences i s retail inflation, that is, Consumer Price Inflation (CPI). Since monetar y policy \u201cworks\u201d by containing  the public\u2019s  inflation expectations and thus wage demands , Consumer Price Inflation is what matters . Second, WPI contains a lot of traded manufactured goods and commodity inputs in the basket, whose price is determined internationally. A low WPI could result from low international                                                             5 I am being a bit loose here. The short run tradeoff works because economic actors can be surprised by unexpected loosening, and the surprise can have positive growth effects. In the long run, the central bank loses its power to surprise, and the public embeds its correct forecast of how much inflation the central bank will create into all nominal variables such as interest rates. To the extent that high inflatio n is harmful for growth and welfare, a central bank that continuously tries to give short run positive surprises will entrench long run high inflation, which will be bad for growth.   4  inflation, while domestic components of inflation such as education and healthcare services as well as retail margins and non -traded fo od are inflating merrily to push up CPI. By focusing on WPI, we could be deluded into thinking we control inflation, even though it stems largely from actions of central banks elsewhere . In doing so we neglect CPI which is what matters  to our common man , and is more the consequence of domestic monetary policy.       The Effective Real Interest Rate, Investments, and Savings  Of course, one reason critics may advocate a focus on WPI is because it is low today, and thus would mean low policy rates. This is  short -sighted reasoning for when commodity prices and global inflation picks up, WPI could well exceed CPI. There is, however, a more subtle argument ; the real interest rate is the difference  between the interest rate a borrower pays and inflation \u2013  it is the true cost of borrowing  in terms of goods like widgets or dosas . If policy interest rates are set to control CPI, they may be too high for manufacturers who see their product prices appreciating only at the WPI rate.  I am sympathetic to the argument, but I also think the concern is overblown. Even if manufacturers do no t have much pricing power because of global competition, their commodity suppliers have even less. So a metal producer benefits from the fall in coal and ore prices, even though they may not get as high a realization on metal sales as in the past. The true  measure of inflation for them is the inflation in their profits, which is likely significantly greater than suggested by WPI.  A second error that is made is to attribute all components of the interest rate paid by the borrower to monetary policy. For hea vily indebted borrowers, however, a large component of the interest rate they pay is the credit risk premium banks charge for the risk they may not get repaid. This credit risk premium is largely independent of where the RBI sets its policy rate.  So when someone berates us because heavily indebted industrialists borrow at 14% interest with WPI at 0.5%, they make two important errors in saying the real interest rate is 13.5%. First, 7.5% is the credit spread, and would not be significantly lower if we cut t he policy rate (at 6.5% today) by another 100 basis points. Second, the inflation that matters to the industrialist is not the 0.5% at which their output prices  are inflating , but the 4 % at which their profits are inflating  (because costs are falling at 5 % annually). The real risk free interest rate they experience is 2.5%, a little higher than elsewhere  in the world , but not the most significant factor standing in the way of investment. Far more useful in lowering borrowing rates is to improve lending inst itutions and borrower behavior to bring down the credit risk premium,  than to try and push the RBI to lower rates unduly . The policy rate in effect plays a balancing act. As important as real borrowing rates for the manufacturer are real deposit rates for the saver. In the last decade, savers have experienced negative real rates over extended periods as CPI has exceeded deposit interest rates. This means that whatever inter est they get has been more than wiped out by the erosion in their principal\u2019s purchasing power due to inflation. Savers intuitively understand this, and had been shifting to investing in real assets like gold and real estate, and away from financial assets  like deposits. This meant that India  needed to borrow from abroad to fund investment, which led to a growing unsustainable current account deficit.  In recent years, our fight against inflation also meant the policy rate came down only when we thought dep ositors could  expect a reasonable positive real return on their financial savings. This has helped increase household financial savings relative to their savings in real assets, and helped bring down the current account deficit. At the same time, I do get a lot of heart -rending letters from pensioners complaining about the cut in deposit rates. The truth is they are better off now than in 5  the past, as I tried to explain in a previous lecture, but I can understand why they are upset when they see their inter est income diminishing.  The bottom line is that in controlling inflation, monetary policy makers effectively end up balanc ing the interests of both investors and savers over the business cycle. At one of my talks, an  industrialist clamored for a 4% rate on  his borrowing. When I asked him if he would deposit at that rate in a safe bank, leave alone invest in one o f his risky friends , he said \u201cNo!\u201d Nevertheless, he insisted on our cutting rates significantly. Unfortunately, policy makers do not have the luxur y of inconsistency.  Supply Constraints   Food inflation has contributed significantly to CPI inflation, but so has inflation in services like education and healthcare. Some argue, rightly, that it is hard for RBI to directly control food demand through monetary policy. Then they proceed, incorrectly, to say we should not bother about controlling CPI inflation. The reality is that while it is hard for us to  control food demand , especially of essential foods,  and only the govern ment can influence food supply through effective management, we can control demand for other , more discretionary , items in the consumption basket through tighter monetary policy. To prevent sustained food inflation from becoming generalized inflation through higher wage increases, we have to reduce inflation in other items . Indeed, overall headline inflation may have stayed  below 6 percent recently even in periods of high food inflation,  precisely because other components of the CPI basket  such as \u201c clothing and footwear\u201d are inflating more slowly.  Fiscal Dominance  Finally, one reason the RBI was historically reluctant to lock itself into an inflation -focused framework is because it feared government over -spending would make its task impossible. The possibility of fiscal dominance, however, only means that  given the inflation objective  set by the government , both the government and the RBI have a role to play. If the government overspends, the central bank has to compensate with tighter policy to achieve the inflation objective. So long as this is commonly understood, an inflation -focused framework means better coordination between the government and the central bank  as they go towards the common goal of macro stability. I certainly believe that the res ponsible recent budget did create room for the RBI to ease in April.  Pragmatic Inflation Focus  As you will understand from all that I have been saying, monetary policy under an inflation focused framework tries to balance various interests as we bring inf lation under control. In doing so, we have to have  a pragmatic rather than doctrinaire mindset. For example, emerging markets can experience significant capital inflows that can affect exchange rate volatility as well as financial stability. A doctrinaire mindset would adopt a hands -off approach, while the pragmatic mindset would permit intervention to reduce volatility and instability. Nevertheless, the pragmatic mind would also recognize that the best way to obtain exchange rate stability is to bring inflation down to a level commensurate with global inflation.  Similarly, while financial stability considerations are not explicitly in the RBI\u2019s objectives, they make their way in because the RBI has to keep growth in mind while controlling inflation. So if t he RBI\u2019s  monetary policies are contributing to a credit or asset price bubble that could lead to a systemic meltdown and growth collapse, the RBI will have to resort to corrective monetary policy if macro -prudential policy alternatives are likely to prove ineffective.   6  The Transition to Low Inflation  The period when a high inflation economy moves to low inflation is never an easy one. After years of high inflation, th e public\u2019s expectations of inflation have been slow to adjust downwards. As a result , they  have been less willing to adjust their interest expectations downwards. Household financial savings are increasing rapidly as a fraction of overall household savings, but not yet significantly as a fraction of GDP .6  Some frictions in the interest rate se tting market do not also help. Even while policy rates are down, the rates paid by the government on small savings are significantly higher than bank deposit rates, as are the effective rates on tax free bonds. I am glad the government has decided to link the rates on small savings to government bond rates, but these rates will continuously have to be examined to ensure they do not form a high floor below which banks cannot cut deposit rates. All in all, bank lending rates have moved down, but not commensur ate with policy rate cuts.  The wrong thing to do at such times is to change course. As soon as economic policy becomes painful, clever economists always suggest new unorthodox painless pathways. This is not a problem specific to emerging markets, but becomes especially acute since every emerging market thinks it is unique, and the laws of economics operate differently here. In India, at least we have been consistent. Flipping through a book of cartoons by that great economist, RK Laxman, I found one that indicated the solution for every ill in 1997 when the  cartoon was published, as now, is for the RBI to cut interest rates by a hundred basis points. Arguments change, but clever solutions do not.  Decades of studying macroeconomic policy tells me to be very wary of economists who say you can have it all if only you try something out of the box. Argentina , Brazil,  and Venezuela tried unorthodox policies with depressingly orthodox consequences. Rather than experiment with macro -policy, which brings macro risks that our unprotected poor can ill afford,  better to be unorthodox on microeconomic policy  such as those that define the business and banking environment . Not only do we have less chance of doing damage if we go wrong, but innovative policy may open new pat hs around old bottlenecks . Specifically , on its part the RBI has been adopting more liberal attitudes towards bank licensing, towards financial inclusion, and towards payment technologies and institutions in order to foster growth.      Institution Building  Let me return to institution building. We had gotten used to decades of moderate to high inflation, with industrialists  and governments paying negative real interest rates and the burden of the hidden inflation tax falling on the middle class  saver  and t he poor. What is happening today is truly revolutionary \u2013 we are abandoning the ways of the past that benefited the few at the expense of the many. As we move towards embedding institutions that result in sustained low inflation and positive real interest rates, this requires all constituencies to make adjustments. For example, if industrialists want significantly l ower rates, they have to support  efforts to improve loan recovery so that banks and bond markets feel comfortable with low credit spreads. The c entral and state governments have                                                             6 Data from household surveys also suggest that household financial savi ngs are moving up.  For example, two recent financial inclusion surveys  for selected states in India - Financial Inclusion Insights survey conducted by InterMedia and the FinScope survey implemented by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) - suggest that among individuals \u201cwho have a bank account\u201d, the fraction who saved through bank deposits increased from 60% in 2013 to 98% in 2015. Of those who \u201csave money\u201d, the fraction saving through a bank increased from 67% in 2013 to 93% in 2015. Of  those who \u201csave money\u201d, the fraction \u201csaving at home\u201d has declined dramatically from 90% in 2014 to 6% in 2015.   7  to continue on the path of fiscal consolidation so that they borrow less and thus spend less on interest  payments . Households will have to adjust to lower nominal rates, but must recognize that higher real rates make their  savings more productive. They will find it worthwhile to save more to finance the enormous investment needs of the country.  Adjustment is difficult and painful  in the short run . We must not get diverted as we build the institutions necessary to secure a low inflation future, especially because we seem to be making headway. The Government has taken the momentous step of both setting a CPI based inflation objective for the RBI as well as  a framework for setting up an independent monetary policy committee.   In the days ahead, a new governor, as well as the members of the committee will be picked. I am sure they will internalize the f rameworks and institutions  that have been set up, and  should produce a low inflation future for India.  The rewards will be many. Our currency has been stable as investors have gained confidence in our monetary policy goals, and this stability will only improve  as we meet our inflation goals . Foreign capital inflows will be more r eliable and increase in the longer maturity buckets , including in rupee investments. This will expand the pool of capital available for our banks and corporations. The government will be able to borrow at low rates, and will be able to extend the maturity of its debt. The poor will not suffer disproportion ately due to bouts of sharp inflation, and the middle class will not see its savings eroded. All this awaits us as we stay the course. Thank you very much for your patience in listening to me.

I am sure you will spend the day discussing advances in the fields of economics and sta tistics. These discussions will be very valuable. We certainly need to improve the quality and timeliness of our statistics, and big data can be very helpful.  What I want to talk about this morning is, however, not the quality or timeliness of the data bu t the use of evidence in the policy  dialogue. Some  may believe that all it takes to convince the body politic of the necessity to choose  one policy over another is to present the evidence, complete with careful, well identified tests. Confronted with the e vidence, the advocates of misguided policies will simply bow to the superiority of the other side\u2019s arguments and withdraw gracefully. Unfortunately, as many of you who advise policymakers know, this is not how the real world works.  Let me make the point using a current debate in India. There is a belief in some quarters that the Reserve Bank has hurt economic growth by keeping interest rates and borrowing costs too high, that those high rates have reduced credit and spending but had little effect on infla tion. Inflation has come down only because of good luck stemming from low energy prices . Furthermore, the RBI  has compounded the growth slowdown by urging banks to clean up their balance sheets. The RBI, of c ourse, stands by its policies. Nevertheless, t his debate is very important because it could shape  policy directions in India over the medium term.  Now what does the evidence say? I am going to offer some simple charts only, not detailed econometric tests, but they should indicate the rationale for our a ctions. Specifically, monetary policy has not been too tight. Instead, I will argue that the slowdown in credit growth has been largely because of st ress in the public sector banks , stemming from past mistakes in lending. This will n ot be fixed just by a c ut in policy rates. Instead, what is required is a clean -up of the balance sheets of public sector banks, which is underway and needs to be taken to its logical conclusion. I will then speculate why economic evidence finds it so hard to prevail in the publ ic debate, not just in India but elsewhere in the world.    1 Inaugural A ddress by Dr. Raghuram Rajan, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the 10th Statistics Day Conference 201 6, Reserve Bank of India on July 26, 2016, Mumbai   1                                                              Public Sector Lending vs Private Sector Lending  Let us start by looking at public sector bank credit growth compared with the growth in credit by the new private banks. As the trend in non- food cre dit growth shows  (Chart 1), public sector bank non- food credit growth has been falling relative to credit growth from the new private sector banks (Axis, HDFC, ICICI, and IndusInd) since early 2014.   This is reflected not only in credit to industry (Chart 2) , but also in micro and small enterprise credit  (Chart 3).2    2 In Chart 2, the latest negative growth April number may be an aberration because of UDAY bonds being transferred from bank loan books to investments  2                                                              The relative slowdown in credit growth, albeit not so dramatic, is also seen in agriculture  (Chart 4) , though public sector bank credit growth is picking up onc e again .     Whenever one sees a slowdown in lending, one could conclude there is no demand for credit \u2013 firms are not investing. But what we see here is a slowdown in lending by public sector banks vis a vis private sector banks. Why is that?  Such a sim ple identification test suggests that the problem is not that aggregate demand for credit is low because interest rates are too high. That would have implied a slowdown in credit across the board. Yet the real rates of credit growth from private sector banks to different sectors are  extremely high, and private banks typically do not charge lower interest rates than public sector banks. This suggest s strong demand for loans from them at prevailing interest rates. The obvious conclusion one should draw , there fore, is that th e slowdown is because something is affecting credit supply from the public sector banks specifically . Could it be the lack of public sector bank capital? I f we look at personal loan growth  (Chart 5), and specifically housing loans  (Chart 6) , public sector bank loan growth approaches private sector bank growth.   3     The lack of capital therefore cannot be the primary culprit. Rather than an across -the-board shrinkage of public sector lending, there seems to be a shrinkage in certain areas o f past high credit exposure, specifically in loans to industry and to small enterprises.  Additionally , the fact that the credit slowdown dates f rom early 2014 suggests that the  bank cleanup, which started in earnest in the second half of fiscal  year 2015, was not the cause. Indeed, the slowdown is best attributed to over -burdened public sector bank balance sheets and growing risk aversion in public sector bankers. T heir aversion to increasing their activity can be seen in the rapid slowdown of their deposi t growth also, relative to private sector banks  (see Chart 7) . After all, why would public sector banks raise deposits aggressively if they are unwilling to lend?  4   In sum, the Indian evidence, supported by the narrative of expe riences from o ther parts of the world such as Europe and Japan, suggests that what we are seeing  is classic behavior by a banking system with balance sheet problems. We are able to identify the effects  because parts of our banking syst em do not suffer from  such problems. The obvious remedy to anyone with an open mind would be to tackle the source of the problem \u2013  to clean the balance sheet s of public sector banks, a remedy that has worked well in other countries where it has been implemented.  Clean up is pa rt of the solution, not the problem , and that is what we are doing . Another take on whether rates are too high  Let me now turn back to inflation. No doubt, the RBI has emphasized the fight against inflation, and a key element of any disinflationary process  is to curtail aggregate demand. At the same time, because past excess investment and low global demand created overcapacity in certain sectors, the RBI could afford to be less aggressive  in curtailing demand than in different circumstances. This is why we  chose a gentle glide path to bringing down inflation, first down to 8 percent in 2015, then 6 percent in 2016, and now 5 percent in 2017. We have cut interest rates by 150 basis points since January 2015. With CPI inflation currently close to the upper bound of our inflation target, f ew could sensibly argue that we have not been adequately accommodative. Of course, our last policy statement indicated we expect it to come down to around 5 percent by March 2017.  Critics offer two contradictory arguments on inflation. On the one hand, they argue that we have killed  demand and growth through high rates \u2013  though this itself seems at odds with the received wisdom that we are the fastest growing large economy in the world. On the other, they argue that our policy has had little effect on curbing inflation, that disinflation  has been a result of the fall in oil and other commodity prices.   5  It is worth pointing out that the disinflation process started in late 2013, long before oil prices collapsed. Moreover, a sign ificant part of the fall in oil prices globally has not been passed on domestically, as the government has hiked excise on petrol and diesel , and refinery margins have also waxed and waned. For instance, even as the price of the Indian crude basket fel l 72 per cent between August 2014 and Jan 2016, the pump price of petrol fell only 17 per cent. Therefore, while I do want to acknowledge the benign international price environment in bringing down inflation, it is not the entire story. To see this, we plot inflation in non- traded education and health care services in Chart 8 , as well as the broader miscellaneous component of the CPI index.  Here too, inflation has come down.   How could the Reserve Bank have brought down inflation without killing demand? By b ringing down the public\u2019s expectations of inflation and by not giving in to the clamor to slash interest rates ! Interestingly, the clamor builds up whenever year -on-year inflation is low relative to the policy rate, no matter whether l ow year -on-year infla tion is because of mechanical base effects, and regardless of whether inflation is projected to go up in the future . No serious central bank determines policy on such a basis , but it sometimes is the focal point for the media debate here.  As a final piece of evidence on whether our pol icy is too tight, consider C hart 9 plotting real policy rates around the world. Given our real growth is amongst the highest in the world, while our inflation is in the upper tier , one would expect our real policy rate to be high. Instead, it is right in the middle of the pack of large countries , and significantly lower than China, a country we often like to compare ourselves with. Once again, evidence seems contradictory to the views of the c ritics of our policy . 6   Finally, some legitimate concerns have been raised about whether our inflation target should include volatile components of inflation like vegetables and other foods. In reality, the RBI has typically looked through such volatility in setting policy rates. Even in the new inflation framework, the inflation target has to be breached three quarters in a row for the MPC to have to explain its failure. Volatile components like veget ables tend to be smoothed over three quarters. At the same time, it is not reasonable to dr op food entirely from the target index. It is the single most important consumption category for most Indians still. Moreover, as Indians get richer, there are some structural shifts in consumption patterns that are reflected in higher prices  for favored i tems. It would not be appropriate to ignore these structural shifts and the need for associated supply responses . It is heartening that after years of high pulse inflation, we are seeing a strong attempt by the Government to encourage pulse cultivation, and early sowing patterns suggest possible significant increases in pulse production.   Why do arguments persist despite contrary evidence?  Why is the debate uninfluenced by the data? Why is it that as we seem to be bringing inflation under control, public vo ices to abandon the fight are loud ? I don\u2019t know for sure but let me hazard a guess; Is it possible  the political economy of inflation is different from the received wisdom we were taught in  class as students?  And are there parallels to the po litical economy of bank cleanup?   Specifically, d espite all the public commentary against inflation and its pernicious effect on the weaker sections of society, there seems to be surprisingly little anxiety in public commentary about inflation so long as it stays in th e high single digits. Industrialists welcome negative real rates of  interest for obvious reasons. Many m iddle class savers value the high nominal interest rates on their fixed deposits, not realizing that their principal is eroding 7  significantly every year . The Keynesian economist is happy because monetary policy is extremely accommodative. The analysts cheer every cut in interest rates because markets are assumed to have a Pavlovian positive response to them. Even th e poor are inured to their fate  of seein g real incomes erode , and are only aggrieved when the price of some food staple sky -rockets. Interestingly, short term spikes in food staples are not really controllable by monetary policy, which then leads to the incorrect generalization that since moneta ry cannot control the politically most important aspects of inflation, it cannot control inflation in general.    With no powerful and vocal political constituency getting agitated about generalized inflation so long as it is only moderately high, opponent s of disinflationary policies are free to frame the debate as they wish. The persuasive way is to claim that interest rates are hurt ing growth. The argument is hard to refute  because there is always some sympathetic borrower who is paying seemingly excessi ve rates. The high prevailing borrowing rate of some small borrower \u2013 say 15 percent today --  is held out as Exhibit A of the central bank\u2019s inconsiderate policies, never mind that the rate charged includes the policy rate of 6.5 percent plus an additional  spread of 8.5 percent, consisting of a default risk premium, a term premium, an inflation risk premium, and the commercial bank\u2019s compensation for costs, none of which are directly aff ected by the policy rate .  The press is constantly urged to frame the debate as inflation versus growth, and with inflation still moderate, only the excessively conservative centr al bank could be against growth!   Never mind that overly accommodative policy today will set up inflation for the future; Never mind that the last f orty years of economic theory and practice suggests that the best way central banks can support growth over the medium term is by keeping inflation low and stable.     The reality , of course, is that high inflation is not stable. As we have seen in India\u2019s  own past, and in other emerging markets , moderately high inflation tends quickly to become very high inflation. The currency then becomes volatile, leading occasionally to external stress. After all, one of the reasons we were termed the Fragile Five in t he summer of 2013 was because of our high inflation. Moreover, the saver eventually recognizes that high inflation erodes the value of his financial savings and switches to real assets like gold. Since we do not mine gold in the country, this also puts pre ssure on the current account.   In sum, the fragilitie s associated with high inflation accumulate, and eventually could lead to crisis. However, the belief that there is a strong powerful domestic constituency against inflation in India, which was drummed i nto our heads as students, may be a myth, 8  certainly at moderately high  levels of inflation. Without any political push back as inflation rises, what is to ensure macroeconomic stability? Unlike more authoritarian Asian economies that used severe administrative measures to deal  with bouts of high inflation during their growth phase , our democratic structure rightly does  not permit such measures. So it is better that we tackle inflation up front by building the necessary institutions. Perhaps this is why succ essive governmen ts, in their wisdom, have given the RBI a measure of independence. Certainly, such concerns would support the current g overnment\u2019s decision to enshrine its  commitment to low inflation through a formal inflation target and the creation of a monetary policy committee.  Interestingly, a similar public dynamic seems to be at work in attitudes towards cleaning up the public sector banks. Clearly, over -levered promoters have no incen tive to see the banks tighten screws and demand repayment. Some public sector bank CEOs with a short remaining tenure would prefer not taking stern action and recognizing NPAs. They might  indeed prefer transferring any problems to their successor. Investors in bank shares, at least initially, do not welcome disclosures o f loan losses.  And depositors, knowing the government stands fully behind public sector banks, are rightly unperturbed by the quality of bank balance sheets.    So it is easy to ignore the problem of loan losses and hope it somehow goes away, much as it is  easy to ignore moderately high inflation. But as with inflation, loan losses have a tendency to increase. The lesson from other countries is that by the time losses get too big to ignore, they are  too late  to manage , and the system is in crisis. As with inflation, it is the task of the central bank to press for bank clean up earlier, when few amongst the public support the central bank\u2019s activism .  Fortunately, after an initial reluctance, banks have enter ed the spirit of the cleanup and some have gone beyond what was demanded of them. The stock market, after reacting negatively initially  early this year , has been more supportive of public sector bank stock prices, probably reflecting the belief the cleanup is good over the medium term . Promoters are sellin g assets and paying up, and new asset reconstruction companies are being started  to buy assets . To restore bank balance sheets to health, it is important this process be taken to its logical conclusion.  Criticism of the central bank  using arguments unsupported by evidence is not just an Indian phenomenon. The Bank of England was criticized for laying out the economic costs of Brexit, the ECB has been criticized for doing too much to restore health to troubled peripheral economy financial sectors, and the F ed is under fire for departing from the Taylor 9  Rule. Criticism comes with the territory, and central banks need to make the case for their policies. At the same time,  it is important that government s around the world look beyond sometimes uninformed and motivated public criticism and protect  the independence of the ir central bank  to act . That is essential for stab le sustainable growth.        10  ", "26 Aug 16 FM.pdf": "1  Strengthening Our Debt Markets1 Thank you for inviting me to speak to FEDAI. In the last few weeks, in successive speeches, I have outlined the RBI\u2019s approach to inflation, distressed debt, financial inclusion, and banking sector reform. I want to speak today about debt markets  and associated derivatives ; why we need them to be deep and liquid, why, in addition to central and state governments, we need riskier firms and projects to be able to access the bond markets for funds, why we need to encourage pro duct innovation, and finally the dilemmas that regulators like the RBI face. In the process, I hope to touch on some of our recent successes, as well as failures, and our ambitions for the future.  There are three important reasons why debt markets have bec ome a lot more attractive in recent months. First, we finally have a framework that commits us to low and stable inflation. Yes, July\u2019s inflation reading was a high 6.07%, but I have no doubt that inflation will fall in the months ahead. The key point is t hat market participants know that the Monetary Policy Committee has to maintain low and stable inflation, certainly over the next five years for which its remit has been set, and it will do what it takes. This lowers the inflation risk premium, and thus re duces the nominal fixed interest rate for everyone , from the government to the riskiest borrower .  In this regard, I am confident that Dr. Urjit Patel, who has worked closely with me on monetary policy for the last three years, will ably guide the Monetary  Policy Committee going forward in achieving our inflation objectives.  A second development has been the reluctance of public sector banks  (PSBs)  to lend, and together with private sector banks, the reluctance to fully pass through past policy rate cuts into bank lending rates. Short term market rates, however, have seen full pass -through. No wonder highly rated firms are bypassing banks to borrow from the commercial paper (CP) markets, with outstanding commercial paper having more than doubled in the last  two years to over 3 lakh crores (see chart below  on CP outstanding  juxtaposed against incremental bank lending ).                                                             1 Governor Dr. Raghuram G. Rajan\u2019s Annual Day Address to Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India on August 26, 2016 at Mumbai  2  But what of lower rated firms? Unfortunately, the difficulty of debt recovery in India has meant that credit spreads are wider  than elsewhere. This is where the third notable development comes in. Recent reforms of the SARFAESI Act and Debt Recovery Tribunals in the short term, and the new Bankruptcy Code in the medium term, should help in enhancing the prospects of repayment, thus reducing credit spreads.  Given these developments, what should the objectives of fixed income market regulation?   The Objectives of Market Regulation  As a developing country regulator, the RBI is focused on enhancing growth while maintaining stability. In the  past, this has meant that the RBI has moved cautiously on liberalizing fixed income and derivatives markets.  What is there about these markets for central banks to worry about?  Typically three issues. We have always worried that markets attract speculato rs, and that in thin markets, the speculative element can move market prices away from fundamentals. This is certainly a concern, but we should also remember that not all speculators think the same way. So long as there is no concerted move to manipulate m arkets  (and this concerted manipulation can be prevented by regulation) , the varied opinions of speculators can provide liquidity , which in turn can make the markets more immune to manipulation. In other words, excessive fear of speculation in markets is self-fulfilling \u2013 it renders markets illiquid and prone to manipulation.  Second, markets can be a source of competition for established institutional players. For instance, as I noted above, high quality corporate credits can migrate from banks to debt markets. This may push banks into higher risk lending. Once again, there is merit in these concerns. However, too much can also be made of them. After all, banks are supposed to lend to riskier clients that need monitoring and hand -holding, while market s are supposed to lend to clients  who do not need such attention . Moreover, the problem in India is too much risk ends up on bank balance sheets, either directly or indirectly. For example, Non -Bank Finance Companies (NBFCs) are supposed to take on greater risk,  such as loans to real estate developers, because their liabilities are longer term. In actuality, though, many have substantial borrowings from banks. It would be better from the perspective of systemic risk if they replaced bank debt with market borrowin g. More generally, some of the very large single and group exposures of banks should b e brought down by forcing large borrowers to raise more market financing.        Third, we worry about unbridled innovation that attempts to get around prudential and supervisory norms and ends up creating uncertain valuations and systemic risk. For instance, the fixed income products and derivatives structured around housing mortgage pools in the United States became hard to value as house prices turned down .  This was a primary factor in the Global Financial Crisis. Once again, though, financial innovation has been useful in opening credit to the hitherto underserved  \u2013 the unfortunately named \u201cjunk\u201d bonds have indeed facilitated the growth of a variety of enterprises and sectors , most  recently shale oil . While r egulators have to weigh carefully the benefits versus the systemic risks posed by every new product, we cannot simply ban all innovation  just because it makes us feel safer . The broader point is that a measured and well -signaled liberalization of fixed income and derivative markets will probably allow us to reap the benefits of deeper and more liquid 3  markets, while minimizing the risks associated with speculation, competition,  and innovation. Over the last few years , we have had to proceed somewhat  cautiously on market development  because we worried about creating vulnerabilities when global financial markets were fragile.  But as  macroeconomic stability  has strengthened , the mo vement has always been forward . Yesterday\u2019s announcements were simply the next steps in steady, measured liberalization . Let me explain.  Participation  Greater participation adds liquidity.  Over the years, we have tried to enhance participation.  Most recen tly, even though retail investors form a small part of the global fixed income  market , we are working  to enhance their access to the institution -dominated screen -based NDS -OM market so that they can trade G -Secs, and also so that they can use their de -mat accounts to do so. However, in markets that require sophisticated understanding, such as complex deri vatives, w e continue to be careful  about broadening retail access.   We can be more relaxed about institutional participation. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) will now have direct access to  a variety of markets including NDS -OM , corporate bond  trading  and perhaps other market segments going forward .  One reason we limited institutional participation in the past was to prevent speculation. So, for example, we required participants to be long an underlying exchange asset, say dollars, in order for them to take a short position in financial markets, and vice -versa. But sometimes the volume of importers hedging prospective imports by buying dollars forward far outweighs the volume of exporters, who hedge future receipts by selling dollars forward. To satisfy the net demand for forward dollar hedging, typically banks have taken the other side . However, to ensure bank stability, we have limited the extent of open positions that banks can hold.  There is a cost to these limits. Every time the market gets imbalanc ed, exchange rates have to move substantially to equalize temporary imbalances between demand and supply, even if unwarranted by medium term fundamentals. This puts more pressure on the central bank to intervene.  We can certainly increase bank open positio n limits, and will do so  over time , but it would not be prudent to place all the exchange risk on banks. A better option would be to allow more players to hold open positions without an underlying, with some limits so that we do not get excessive speculati on or attempts at manipulation by single traders. This can rectify market imbalances, improving exchange market liquidity and depth, without imposing large demands on banks or on the RBI.  The RBI took a fundamental step in this direction yesterday by allow ing a moderate open position to all market participants. Based on experience, the RBI will decide further moves.  Finally, not all participation adds to liquidity and depth in Indian markets. For example, some foreign organizations have suggested allowing t rading of domestically issued Indian securities abroad, only reporting the trades domestically. Unfortunately, this could subtract trading on Indian exchanges, and thereby diminish liquidity. We have suggested to such organizations that they either conduct  their trades on the Indian exchanges, or that they direct their clients to Masala bonds . The former is still under discussion.  4   Innovation  Financial innovation is sometimes seen in a bleak light as a way to evade or avoid taxes and regulations. Properly  done, however, financial innova tion can  slice and dice risks so that they are placed on the right shoulders. One example of such an instrument is interest rate futures, where after an overhaul in 2013-14, the last 12 months\u2019 average daily trading volume was close to Rupees 23 billion  (despite falling in recent months ). An investor, bank, or corporation can use the IRF market to gain or shed interest exposures as they desire. The key to the success of this market has been to allow the design of the relevan t instrument to be governed by market participants, while ensuring regulatory concerns are satisfied.  We are proceeding in a similar way with money market futures contracts.  Not all innovative instruments have been successful. Inflation Indexed Bonds (IIBs ) tied to the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) have not been very popular because the RBI has moved away from a focus on the WPI to a focus on CPI. Even the market for CPI indexed IIBs has been lukewarm. The moderate investor interest perhaps reflects the disin flationary environment,  where inflation protection is less sought after. Also, u nlike the more tax -protected Gold Monetization Bonds, the CPI indexed IIBs are  not fully tax protected against inflation.  Going forward, a level playing field on taxes is warra nted for all instruments, so that instruments do not gai n favor simply because they get  better tax treatment.   The lesson from these examples is that financial innovation needs support, not to create tax or regulatory arbitrage, but so that appealing features are encouraged. Innovation also requires tinkering, to modify what does not work until something more appealing can be found \u2013 the first versions of Interest Rate Futures were not attractive, but later versions have succeeded. This is why the RBI has moved to a sandbox approach, where we are liberal towards early product innovations so long as they are not clearly problematic, regulating more carefully only when interest picks up and the product looks like it might become of systemic importance.  Finally, an important function for the regulator in encouraging financial innovation is to create the necessary infrastructure. For instance, a number of financial contracts are structured off benchmarks. RBI has encouraged the setting up of the Financial B enchmarks India Pvt. Limited (FBIL)  which is building  a series of market benchmarks. I am hopeful that these will soon be used in innovative financial contracts.   Internationalization  As a current account deficit country, India needs financing from abroad. Ideally, we would like to attract risk capital, which is in short supply in this country. This means encouraging Foreign Direct Investment, as well as equity investment.  Foreign investors can also help deepen debt and derivativ e markets as they contribute to price discovery and liquidity.  Not all domestic entities should issue claims held by foreign investors. Ideally, of course, companies should be left to make decisions about what currency they borrow in, and how much they hedge, but given our weak bankruptcy system, there is moral hazard built into unhedged foreign borrowing \u2013 if the rupee appreciates, the pr omoter takes all the upside associated with paying the low dollar interest rate and the now -lower principal, if the rupee depreciates, the occasional unscrupulous promoter goes to his Indian bankers and asks them 5  to bail him out. This is why the issuance o f short term dollar  or yen denominated debt by infrastructure companies, if left unhedged, could be severely problematic in case of rupee depreciation.  Therefore, w e have encouraged companies that do not have foreign exchange earnings to either i ssue long  term dollar bonds, fully hedged shorter term bonds, or rupee denominated Masala bonds abroad. The first issues recently of Masala Bonds reflect a coming of age of India n debt that has been insufficiently remarked upon  \u2013 for the first time in recent decade s, the rupee \u2019s value  is trusted enough in international markets that corporations can issue there  in domestic currency. Going forward, we hope a more vibrant Masala bond market abroad will complement a vibrant domestic corporate bond market.  Even though FD I flows are enough to cover our current account deficit, we are also encouraging inflows into the debt markets to improve depth and liquidity. We have progressively expanded FPI limits in government debt, and recently specified how these limits will expand  for the foreseeable future. We have also opened up investment in state government debt , and laid out the medium term plan for those limits also . In general, our aim is to liberalize steadily, but in a thoughtful way, continuously asking how further libera lization will strengthen our domestic markets.  We have not been persuaded by every market plea. For example, a number of investment banks want a dollar denominated G -Sec issued internationally \u2013 ostensibly to create a benchmark dollar yield curve for India n instruments. While I agree such an instrument would be attractive for investors in the yield -starved world, I am not persuaded it is useful  for India . When much of the emerging world would love to move from issuing dollar debt to issuing in its own curre ncy so as to avoid currency risk, I don\u2019t see why we should move the other way. Instead, let us build out an international quasi -sovereign rupee yield curve , so that rupee issuances can be priced easily. It is with this in mind that we have allowed banks t o issue Masala bonds yesterday, with bank bonds being a good quasi -sovereign proxy.   Liquidity    Of course, not all parts of the rupee yield curve are liquid, even in the domestic G -Sec market. At the very short end, we are trying to bring more liquidity and better pricing through the auctioning of term repos. At the longer end, we have been trying to focus on more illiquid securities in our open market operations so that the term curve evens out. We are also  proposing to encourage market making in specifi c G-Sec instruments  by involving Primary Dealers . One way to bring liquidity to corporate debt is to enable them to be used as collateral in repo transactions with the central bank, with appropriate haircuts, of course. As banks become able to borrow again st their high quality corporate bonds, yields will fall, and more issuers will come to the market. With this in mind, we have initiated the process with the Government to amend the RBI Act to allow the RBI to conduct repos of corporate bonds  with banks and  other financial institutions .   Ratings , Contingent Support , and Supply  The ratings put out by credit rating agencies are important in assuring arm \u2019s length investors about corporate credit quality. In order for their ratings to be accurate, agencies need  both up -6  to-date information, as well as good analysis. Agencies have asked the RBI to give them information about corporate bank borrowings. Since these are available from the credit information bureaus (CIBs), the RBI has suggested the credit rating agen cies become members of CIBs. Hopefully, incidents where a highly rated corporate bond plummets without warning into default will become increasingly rare as rating agencies exercise due diligence.  Some have argued that the easy access to bank cash credit k eeps large corporations from going to the money and bond markets for funds. This phenomenon also raises bank exposures to single names or groups, increasing their risk concentration. While as suggested earlier, we are seeing some movement of corporations t o the money and bond markets in this period of bank stress, we will nudge corporations further by imposing higher provisioning and capital requirements for banks on such corporate lending when exposures become large.  Many of the measures proposed so far w ill enhance the attractiveness of highly rated corporate bonds to investors. But infrastructure projects that need substantial amounts of financing may not start out highly rated. To enable such entities to issue, we have allowed banks to offer credit enha ncement to such bonds. We have been careful to set the capital requirement for such credit enhancement commensurate with the risk banks are taking on so that there is no arbitrage. Yesterday\u2019s announced measures should make it easier for banks to offer app ropriate amounts of credit enhancement.  One area that needs greater clarification is obligations of state governments as well as state -government guaranteed obligations. In order for state government obligations to have zero risk weight, and have the highe st rating, it is important that there be no explicit or implicit default or restructuring of such obligations. While a restructuring may seem like a way to postpone obligations, its ramifications , not just for the yield the market will demand of the partic ular state government issuer in the future but also for the yields on obligations of other state governments, are large enough that such actions should continue to remain \u201cunthinkable\u201d.  Regulations  We are conscious of the limitations placed on netting of d erivative contracts, and thus the higher associated capital requirements  on banks . The issue has been taken up with the Government, and we hope to amend the RBI Act to make such netting possible. As with the tax issues associated with securitization, which have recently been addressed  by the Government , resolving this issue should hope fully lead to substantial market activity.   Finally, while the RBI is a liberalizer, w e have to be careful not to relax prudential regulations simply because an entity or activity is deemed of national importance. Dispensation on prudential regulation is the wrong instrument to favo r such activities. A nationally important activity such as infrastructure may be very risky. To require lower provisions, or to allow higher leverage or ECBs against such activities, may increase systemic risk. In the long run, t he activity may be damaged by the regulatory dispensation (too many infrastructure projects that do not have dollar earnings will be  financed with dollar or yen loans and cannot repay) and stability may also be compromised. It is far better for the Governm ent to directly subsidize such activities if it deems them important than for RBI to sacrifice systemic stability on the altar of national importance.  7  Conclusion  Let me conclude. While the RBI has been cautious in reforming during the recent period of global market turmoil, it has not stood still. Market reforms have proceeded at a steady measured pace. Observers may be impatient, but my belief is that steady and irreversible reform and \u201cmini Bangs\u201d like yesterday\u2019s rather than \u201cBig Bang\u201d is the need of the  hour. As global conditions become less uncertain, the pace of reform can pick up. The lessons we have learnt during this period on what works will be invaluable then.  Thank you.

The NDC has earned  a reputation for being a centre of excellence in the study and practice of National Security and Strategy. It is good to see a mix of officers of Armed Forces and Civil Services from India as well as from other countries who are participating in this course . In my experience, these inter- disciplinary and cross -country gatherings,  as in your case,  provide the best opportunities for learning and evolution of ideas.   2. Central banks remain at the heart  of modern monetary and financial system s. They have several instruments at their disposal to carry out their wide-ranging mandate which includes monetary policy as the prime tool to achieve macroeconomic stability. In this process, central banks through their monetary policy operations influence longe r-term interest  rates, overall economic activity and ultimately, prices.  They aim to achieve price stability (low and stable inflation) over a period of time while minimising fluctuations in output and employment. Over time, the functions and priorities of central banks have evolved in line  with domestic and global economic and financial development s and the prevailing political-economic discourse. Yet, fostering monetary and financial stability has always remained the most important policy anchor of a central bank in its pursuit of achieving  maximum sustainable levels of output in the economy. This is aptly reflected in the Preamble to the Reserve Bank of India Act , 1934 that describes the broad mandate of the Reserve Bank as follows:  2  \u201cit is expedient to constitute a Reserve Bank for India to regulate the issue of Bank notes and keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage\u201d .  3. In my talk today, I shall focus on the evolution of ideas that shaped Indian monetary policy. Monetary policy is not merely a science where we tweak some instrument to achieve an objective. It is also an art of creating new instruments and taking policy calls in response to anticipated and evolving challenges and communicating them with prescience and clarity, especially during crisis times. Decisiveness, timing  and communication are key to effective monetary policy. In my address today,  I propose to  dwell upon aspects of monetary policy and central bank communication.   Evolution of Monetary Policy in India  Early Phase  4. The evolution of the Reserve Bank\u2019s monetary policy framework has closely tracked eco nomic and financial development  of our country.  After independence, India  pursued a policy of planned economic development. Monetary policy, therefore, largely focused on expanding the availability and access to credit for the development needs of the economy. This was followed by mounting inflationary concerns in  the 1960s and 19 70s on account  of deficit financing,  frequent supply shocks in agricultural sector,  global oil price shocks of 1973 and 1979, and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 19731. During these times, i nflation control  was largely based on price controls by the Government and selective credit control s                                                             1 The Bretton Woods system -  following the United Nations Bretton Woods Conference in New Hampshire, United States in 1944 \u2013 refers to the system of semi -fixed exchange rates and controlled capital flows that was adopted by countries after World War II to promote international economic cooperation and avoid repeating the competitive currency devaluations that contributed to the Great Depression of the 1930s.  3  and moral suasion by the Reserve Bank to restrain banks from extending credit for speculative purposes.   Monetary Targeting  5.  Against the backdrop of high inflation amidst rising fiscal dominance, a rule-based monetary targeting framework was adopted on the recommendations of the Sukhamoy Chakravarty Committee (1985).  In this framework, reserve money was used as the operating target while broad money served as the intermediate target  for controlling inflation by regulating monetary expansion consistent with inflation and growth objectives2. Nonetheless, due to continued expansionary fiscal policy , both the statutory liquidity ratio ( SLR) and the cash reserve ratio (CRR ) had to be progressively increased in the 1980s to  reach their peak levels by the early 1990s3. The pre -emption of resources through CRR and SLR reduced the space for meeting the credit requirements of the economy.  In the wake of trade and financial sector reforms in the early 1990s and the consequent rise in foreign capital flows,  financial innovations and a notable shift towards market -based financing, the monetary targeting framework that rested on the assumption of a stable relationship between money, output and prices came under scrutiny towards the later part of the 1990s.   Multiple Indicators Approach  6. With questions on t he efficacy of the prevalent monetary targeting framework, the Reserve Bank of India adopted multiple indicators (MI)                                                             2 Reserve money refers to the primary liquidity created by the Reserve Bank, and this forms the basis of the subsequent credit creation by banks in the country. Reserve money is defined as the sum of currency in circulation, bank\u2019s balances with RBI and other deposits with RBI (in other words, liabilities of the RBI). Money supply in the economy is the liability of the banking system  (commercial as well as cooperative bank and RBI)  and is defined as currency with the public, their demand and time deposits with banks and other deposits with RBI.  3 While SLR was hiked to preempt greater resources for the government  for financing higher borrowing requirements , unfettered government spending posed inflation challenges which were managed  through CRR increases.  4  approach in April 19984. In the MI approach,  there was a greater emphasis on interest rate vis-\u00e0-vis quantity channels (money supply) for monetary policy formulation. Interest rates in different markets (money, capital and government securities markets) along with high frequency data on currency, credit extended by banks and financial institutions, fiscal position, trade, capital flows, inflation rate, exchange rate, among others, were juxtaposed with output data for drawing policy perspectives.  In other words, policy emphasis shifted to price of credit (i.e., interest rate) rather than quantity of credit. Accordingly, short -term interest rates became key instruments in signalling the monetary poli cy stance of the RBI. The liquidity operations of the RBI were geared to align market rates with the policy stance. The MI approach served well by delivering low inflation and high growth prior to the global financial crisis.   Flexible Inflation Targeting   7. In the post  global financial crisis (GFC)  period and, particularly, after the taper tantrum episode of 2013, the credibility of the MI framework came into question as persistently high inflation and tepid growth began to co- exist. The MI approach with its focus on a large set of indicators did not provide a clearly defined nominal anchor for monetary policy. An Expert Committee set up by the RBI to revise and strengthen the monetary policy framework, in its report submitted in  January 2014, recomme nded that inflation, defined in terms of headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation  \u2013 CPI-Combined \u2013 should be the nominal anchor for monetary policy. India formally adopted flexible inflation targeting (FIT) with the amendment of the RBI Act in June 2016. T he amended Act  states                                                             4 The shift to a more market oriented monetary policy framework also brought about institutional changes as the department handling monetary policy in the Reserve Bank was re- designated as Monetary Policy Department effective January 1, 1998 from the erstwhile C redit Planning Cell.  5  the role of the RBI in  monetary policy as follows:  \u201cthe primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth\u201d.   8. The amended Act also explicitly  recognised that it is essential to have a monetary policy framework to meet the challenges  of an increasingly complex economy and that the monetary policy framework shall be operated by the Reserve Bank of India. Price stability under the statute has been defined numerically by a target of 4 per cent for headline CPI with a tolerance band of +/ - 2 per cent around it.  The flexibility in the FIT regime comes from provisions to accommodate or see -through transitory supply side shocks to inflation. Failure to meet the monetary policy objective is defined in terms of average headline CPI inflation remaining lower or higher than the 2 to 6 per cent band for three consecutive quarters, rather than any instance where inflation exceeds / falls below  the target. This helps monetary policy to avoid undue volatility in rate setting behaviour that may adversely impact growth.  The repo rate was defined as the policy rate and a monetary policy committee (MPC) was set up in the RBI \u2013 with both internal and external members \u2013 to determine the repo rate with the objective of achieving the mandated inflation target. The MPC resolution containing the committee\u2019s assessment and outlook on growth and inflation, including numerical projections, the repo rate decision and the rationale thereof is released immediately after the MPC meeting  along with voting pattern of the members . Statements of Individual members covering their own assessment and justifications for their  decision are released 14 days after the meeting in the minutes.   6  9. The clearly defined inflation target and the band, the setting up of the MPC, the explicit accountability mechanisms for defining failure in meeting the target, the detailed resolution and the quick release of individual assessments in the minutes have strengthened transparency and credibility of monetary policy formulation in India .  Overall, a consensus has emerged post -GFC around a holistic approach that focused on inflation targeting as well as macro- financial stability.  It is interesting to note that the central banks \u2019 function as the lender of last resort (LOLR) has remained intact, notwithstanding the developments and refinements in the policy frameworks across countries, including India.  Within the broad objectives, however, the relative emphasis on inflation, growth and financial stability has varied across both monetary policy regimes as well as in different phases of the business cycle. Although global experience \u2013 with financial stability as an added policy objective  \u2013 is still evolving, the Reserve Bank has always been giving due importance to financial stability risks through active use of macro- prudential policy tools.   10. The FIT framework has served us well since its inception in 2016 even as the economy faced a sequence of shocks in this period. The framework\u2019s flexibility and efficacy were tested significantly in the past couple of years as we have been grappl ing with the once in a century crisis,  the COVID -19 pandemic. The flexible framework allowed the MPC to continue with the accommodative monetary policy stance in support of growth even as inflation intermittently touched or exceeded the upper end of the inflation band due to large supply shocks and other bottlenecks. This was facilitated through prescient communication \u2013  as F IT is essentially a forward- looking framework. Emphasis was given on 7  communicating the rationale of policy measures and decisions with clarity  which is crucial  for conditioning market expectations.   Role of Communication   Global Context  11. Only a few decade s ago, c entral banks were shrouded in secrecy and their work was viewed as esoteric and beyond the reach of the common people . Central banks worked in not so open or transparent manner and perhaps believed that policy traction came from  surprising the market . Their communication often bordered on being delightfully vague, mystifying  and remarkably opaque, often labelled as \u201cconstructive ambiguity\u201d5. Who can forget the famous quote of the US Fed\u2019s former chairman  Alan Greenspan:  \u201cSince I've become a central banker, I've learned to mumble with great incoherence. If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said\u201d6.   12. In contrast, communication s of central banks today are known for their clarity,  precision,  accountabil ity and transparency. This change has occur red mainly because  of two reasons. First, as central banks became more independent in their areas  of operation, they also needed to be more transparent and accountable in a democratic set up to  garner public trust. Second, central banks have increasingly used communication as an instrument of monetary policy to condition market expectations that is essential for efficient and effective transmission of monetary policy signals7. The behaviou r of forward- looking  economic agents \u2013 firms  and                                                             5 Greenspan, Alan. (2007) The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World. New York: Penguin Press.  6 Speaking to a Subcommittee of the US Congress, November -December 1987  7 See, for example, Blinder et al. (2008), \u201cCentral Bank Communication and Monetary Policy: A Survey of Theory and Evidence\u201d , NBER Working Paper 13932   8  consumers \u2013 is influenced more by their future expectations of interest rates, prices and incomes  rather than just the current changes in these variables. Accordingly, central banks offer forward guidance \u2013 both implicit and explicit \u2013 to manage expectations  in the economy. Thus,  communication is an extremely potent component of the toolkit of modern central banks .  13. Communication , however,  is also a double- edged sword. During the global financial crisis, a coordinated response by the major central banks helped avert the worst effect of the crisis. Mr. Mario Draghi\u2019s declaration as the President of the European Central Bank to do \u201c whatever it takes\u201d to preserve the euro amidst the eurozone debt crisis of July 2012 boosted market  sentiments . On the other hand, communication by the US Fed during May 2013 on its future monetary policy path triggered the taper tantrum episode of heightened global financial market volatility as markets were caught off guard by the announcement . Therefore, communication needs  to be balanced  and well -telegraphed to avoid unintended consequences.    14. The current global conditions, after about two  years of living through the pandemic, are now posing complex challenges for central bank communication . A number of economies, including the major ones, are  facing multi- decadal high inflation  due to supply disruptions,  tighter labour markets, fragility of the just in time inventory management and geo-political disturbances. Central banks are in a bind \u2013 if they act aggressively  to contain inflation which may perhaps subside as normalcy returns, they run the risk of setting in recession; o n the other hand, if they  act too little and too late, they may be blamed for \u201cfalling behind the curve\u201d and may have to do a lot of catching up later which will be detrimental to growth. 9  Meanwhile, financial markets world over have turned extremely volatile as they have been left grappling with heightened uncertainty over the pace of future monetary policy normalisation.  Recent geo -political developments have further aggravated the challenges and dilemmas for the central banks.  Amidst these uncertainties, central banks have to find  the optimal ground s with attendant communication challenges .    Our Recent  Approach  15. At the Reserve Bank, we are mindful of  the importance of communication given our multifarious responsibilities and wider ramifications of our  action s. We have followed a consultative approach by periodically interacting with various stakeholders on policy formulation .  This has particularly served us well in designing appropriate policy response s, especially during the pandemic.  We believe in two- way communication  for informed policy decisions.  With this objective, we h old detailed interactions with analysts, economists, researchers, banks, academic bodies and research institutions, trade and industry associations, and several others. We have followed this approach  not only for the much- publicised monetary policy action s but also for other policies.  We also recognise that communication needs to be backed by  commensurate actions to build credibility and instil wider confidence in our policies. We explain the rationale of our actions in the best traditions of accountability and transparency, the hallmark of a modern market -based approach to monetary policy making.   16. As part of our monetary policy , we have actively used communication through a variety of tools \u2013 the MPC resolutions and minutes, my exhaustive post -policy statements together with statement on developmental and regulatory measures,  press conferences, speeches 10  by me and my colleagues, and our other publications, especially the bi -annual Monetary Policy Report  (MPR)  \u2013 to anchor expectations. Our policies, especially  the relative emphasis on inflation and growth are always based on an objective assessment of all relevant factors ; and we  make it a point to communicate our policy decisions,  including through interactions with the media, to facilitate clarity in understanding.  During 2019 when we embarked upon a cycle of rate cuts and change of stance from \u2018calibrated tightening\u2019 to \u2018neutral\u2019 and then to \u2018accommodative\u2019, the accompanying communications were unambiguous. On various occasions, we had stated \u201cit is vital to act decisively and in a timely manner\u201d to support growth; \u201cto boost aggregate demand, and in particular, private investment activity\u201d ; and similar other pronouncements to provide market guidance.    17. With the declaration of COVID- 19 as a pandemic in March 2020, communication  became more challenging as we had only digital interface  with media and market participants while at the same time we had to undertake several emergency conventional and unconventional measures as the crisis unfolded. The Governor\u2019s statement  of March 27, 2020 highlighted that the outbreak of the pandemic warranted not only an advancement of the date of MPC meeting, but it also merited \u201c a sizeable reduction of 75 basis points in the policy repo rate\u201d which was \u201cintended to (i) mitigate the negative effects of the virus; ( ii) revive growth; and above all, (iii) preserve financial stability.\u201d The statement unfurled several  other measures to  combat the pandemic while providing the much  needed optimism by stating \u201cit is worthwhile to remember that tough times never last; only tough people and tough institutions do \u201d. The message was clear \u2013 we need to stand firm, maintain resilience and do whatever it takes to deal with the situation.  11  18. These decisive and timely measures, which eased financial conditions while unfreezing  the markets considerably, got reflected in reduced spreads on money and bond market instruments and higher trading volumes  in corporate bonds. Reiterating optimism , it was noted in my April 17, 2020  statement that \u201c Although social distancing separates us, we stand united and resolute. Eventually, we shall cure; and we shall endure \u201d. In May 2020, sensing that \u201cthe macroeconomic impact of the pandemic is turning out to be more severe than init ially anticipated \u201d, the MPC decided to reduce the policy repo rate further by 40 basis points. The Governor\u2019s statement concluded with the words \u201c Today\u2019s trials may be traumatic, but together we shall triumph\u201d.   19. The Reserve Bank\u2019s response at the height of  the pandemic was prompt and decisive. Mo re than 100 measures were undertaken since March 2020. Moreover, on two occasions \u2013  March and May 2020 \u2013  the MPC meeting s were held ahead of the schedule; while t wo other standalone statements were made by the Governor outside the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cycle \u2013  one in April 2020 in the early days of  COVID -19 crisis and the other in May 2021 at the peak of the second wave. These off cycle MPC meetings and standalone statements demonstrated the RBI \u2019s readiness to undertake pre-emptive actions . We were perhaps the only central bank in the world to have set up a special quarantine facility with about 200 officers, staff and service providers, engaged in critical activit ies to ensure business continuity in banking and financial market operations and payment systems.   20. In October 2020, supply- side pressures had taken inflation above the tolerance band of 2 to 6 per cent  and there were market concerns over the continuation of the accommodative monetary policy stance, even as 12  output was well -below its pre -pandemic level. Given these circumstances, the MPC reinforced its forward guidance by supplementing state -contingent forward guidance with time-contingent guidance by stating its intent to continue \u201c with the accommodative stance of monetary policy as long as necessary \u2013 at least during the current financial year and into the next year \u2026\u201d. Inflation eased in the second half of 2020- 21 in line with the MPC\u2019s assessment as supply side pressures abated. T he time -based element of the guidance did help to anchor market expectations and moderate undue expectations building up at that time of a possible reversal of the monetary policy stance.    21. Communication exemplifying explicit forward guidance, whose role and nature is continuously evolving, came to the fore in April 2021 o n the eve of the virulent second wave of infections. The MPC reverted from both state - and time-based forward guidance  to state -based guidance , realising that  \u201cit is difficult to perfectly foresee how the economy evolves and when the recovery gets firmly entrenched given the persistence of the pandemic .\u201d The RBI instituted a secondary market G -sec Acquisition Programme (G-SAP) which provided  an upfront commitment to a specific amount of open market purchase of government securities, in order to assuage market  concerns on the size of the government borrowing programme for 2021- 22 and its impact on interest rates in the bond market . This measure, combined with the explicit  recognition that the yield curve is a public good whose orderly evolution is the shared responsibility of both market participants and the Reserve Bank, benefited all stakeholders by anchoring yield expectations and provided a benchmark for the pricing of other financial instruments.   13  22. Recalibrating the pandemic time policy path, as and when the situation warrant s, would present its own share of communication challenges. For RBI\u2019s crisis measures announced with pre -specified terminal dates, market expectations remained  anchored and communication challenges were minimal when these measures go t automatically withdrawn. On the other hand, measures or unwinding of open- ended policies,  as and when they happen,  would require careful, nuanced  and measured communication as in such instances,  the expectations of certain segments of the market may not be in sync with that of the central bank\u2019s assessment.   Illustratively , the Governor\u2019s policy statement of February 2021 addressed the  fears of reversal of monetary policy which were building up due to resumption of variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) operation in January 2021, by explaining the rationale for the reintroduction of VRRR  more explicit ly. Similarly, liquidity rebalancing was set in motion in August 2021 through periodic upscaling of the 14- day main VRRR auction so as to ensure that liquidity conditions \u201c evolve in sync with the macroeconomic developments to preserve financial stability \u201d. In the same spirit, G -SAP operations were discontinued in October  2021 given \u201c the existing liquidity overhang, the absence of a need for additional borrowing for GST compensation and the expected expansion of liquidity in the system  \u2026\u201d.   23. As I proceed to conclude, l et me briefly summarise how we have been different from other central banks in our pandemic response. First, we have undertaken unconventional measures even before exhausting the conventional policy space; i.e ., even before reaching the zero lower bound of interest rates.  Second, the counterparties involved in our operations were only banks and All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs) as liquidity provided to targeted sectors were channelised through them . 14  Third, we have confined our asset purchase programme to central and state government securities and have not diluted RBI\u2019s collateral standards in our lending operations, unlike many other central banks. Fourth, most of our measures were announced with pre- set terminal dates instead of being open- ended . This has reinforced the credibility of our announcements. Fifth, while stating  and in facilitating the \u201devolution of the yield curve as a public good \u201d, we have solely operated in the secondary market unlike some inflation targeting EME central banks that made emergency provisions to operate in the primary market to finance the government directly. Sixth and f inally, we have continued with our accommodative stance based on our own domestic growth -inflation dynamics, amidst current divergence in policy actions of central banks across the world.   Thus, we have used the flexibility embedded in the FIT framework and implemented our monetary policies, without compromising on our primary mandate of price stability. The raison d'\u00eatre of our actions, as I mentioned earlier,  was communicated through speeches, post -policy press conferences and media interactions.   Concluding Observations  24. Let me conclude by saying that \u2018 change\u2019  has been the only constant in the theory and practice of monetary policy. There is no last word yet on what constitutes the  best practice of monetary policy. The conduct of monetary policy has undergone notable changes both in India and across the world as economies and markets evolved and policymakers gained greater insights into how economic agents interact in a complex economic system.   25. Globally, the evolution of monetary policy has swung  from being more directive and discretionary  to a strict  rule-based  regime, before 15  settling to the current consensus for a pragmatic mix of rules and discretion . In this process, communication has gained importance  although it  works both ways \u2013 while too much of communication can confuse the market , too little may  keep it guessing about the central bank\u2019s policy intent.  Therefore, central banks have to tread a very fine line. As monetary policy is an art of managing expectations8, central banks have to make continual efforts to shape and anchor  market expectations,  not just through pronouncements and actions but also through a constant refinement of  their communication strategies to ensure the desired societal outcomes . This is, however, an iterative process and central banks are only getting better at it incrementally.  Thank you. Stay well. Namaskar!                                                                     8 Michael D.

Among them is releasing the books by former Governors. It is a pr ivilege to which I attach a lo t of value, something which I prize.  Newton  2. Because the occasion demands it, I must re peat what I said at the Reserve Bank\u2019s Platinum Jubilee.   3. Those of you who have had some exposure to the history of science would know that Sir Isaac Newton was an intellectually arrogant man. When his friend and rival, Robert Hooke wrote to him, applauding him for his la w of gravity, Newton, for all his arrogance, wrote back with uncharacteristic humility:  \u201cIf I have been able to see a little fu rther, it is because  I am standing on the shoulders of giants.\u201d  That is a statement I can relate to. As th e Governor of the Reserve Bank in these exciting times, I owe an intelle ctual debt of gratitude to al l the extraordinary men who led this great institution through several challenges,  and made a mark in the economic history of India. Among the most distinguished of them is Dr. I.G. Patel. I am proud and privileged to be in th e same lineage as him.     Special Occasion  4. I did not know Dr. Patel personally. He was already in the top echelons of the Government when I joined the civil service;  when he was the Governor of the Reserve Bank I was a junior officer in the Government of Andhra Pradesh. Much to my loss, our paths never crossed. This association with late Dr. Patel, of releasing his book, posthumously - vicarious, as it may be - is therefore very special for me.  OUP 5. I want to thank Oxford University Press for giving me  this privilege.  Ms. Alaknanda Patel  6. Those of you who have known Mrs. Alaknanda  Patel will, of course, relive some memories, through interaction with her today. Ov er the last few years, I have developed a close friendship with her. I have always been impressed by her intelligence, charm, vivaciousness; and have been touched by how much she loves all of us in the Reserve Bank and the efforts she makes to maintain he r bond with the Reserv e Bank even after all these years.  Alaknanda, your presence here means a lo t to all of us in the Reserve Bank. The Book  7. This book \u201cOf Economics, Policy and Development\u201d is a collection of largely unpublished papers by Dr. Patel. \u2022 They cover a wide canvas Money, finance, trade, balance of payments, economic development and international political economy issues.   \u2022 They cover a wide time span  2Articles written when he was a young economis t at the IMF to articles and papers written after Dr. Patel evolved as one of leading public intellectuals of the country.   \u2022 They span a vast intellectual spectrum - Papers with deep academic orientation - Articles with profound practical policy implications  What is common across all of the articles /papers regardless of the topic is deep scholarship, sharp intellect and above all an abiding concern for public interest.  Ideas and Issues Resonate Even Today 8. What has struck me as I browsed through the bo ok is that several of the ideas and issues that Dr. Patel addressed resonate even in today\u2019s context, both at home and around the world.  I will comment on some of the ideas that he raised. ___________________________________________________________________   3 I. Monetary Policy 9. In one of the articles, Dr. Patel reviews the evolution of monetary policy in the post-war years compared to the pre-war years. He writes: [Quote] \u201cThe supreme test of monetary policy lies in its ability to control the supply of money in such a way that growth  in prices is checked without retarding the growth in production.\u201d[Unquote]  10. The essence of that sentence  is that checking growth in prices without retarding production; that is the quintess ential growth versus inflatio n debate that is playing out even today.   11. A relevant question in this context is the following:  \u2018To what extent is the Reserve Bank acting consistent with Dr. Patel\u2019s dictum of controlling prices without hurting production?\u2019  12. By far the most strident criticism against the Reserve Bank has been that even after persistent and prolonged tighteni ng of monetary policy - by raising interest rate 13 times - we have not been able to restrain infl ation. On the other ha nd, we stifled growth.  13. So the question is has the Reserve Bank faile d in following the dictum that Dr. Patel prescribed?  14. I don\u2019t believe so. In fact I will argue that the Reserve Bank\u2019s action is fully consistent with Dr. Patel\u2019s dictum of trying to protect growth with price stability.   15. Let me explain.  4\u0083 Inflation is inimical to growth. There cannot be much disagreement on that.   \u0083 Low and stable inflation is an essential pre-condition for securing medium-term growth. Only in a situation of price st ability can consumers and investors make informed decisions.   \u0083 The Reserve Bank's monetary stance has b een aimed at restraining demand and at managing inflation expectations.  \u0083 Admittedly, monetary tightening has resulted  in some sacrifice of growth in the short-term. That is an inevitable price to pay for price stability. But the sacrifice in growth is only in the short-term. In the medium-term, there is no trade-off between growth and inflation.   Philips Curve  16. Another facet of this growth-inflation debate that has played out in the recent period has been the growth-inflation trade-off in the context of the Philips curve. \u2022 The argument is that we can raise growth  by tolerating higher inflation. This is misguided.   \u2022 Relationship between growth and inflation is non-linear.  \u2022 There is a threshold level of inflation.  \u2022 Below the threshold, may be, there is a trade-off between growth and inflation.  \u2022 Above the threshold, there is no trade-o ff between growth and inflation, higher inflation actually leads to loss of growth. With WPI in flation at 7.25 per cent and CPI inflation in double digits, we  are way above the threshold.  \u2022 What is the threshold level of inflation?  That maybe around 5 per cent. Inflation today is above the threshold.  5 17. Dr. Patel\u2019s dictum about maintaining growth with price stability is the quintessential objective of monetary policy. \u2022 That is something that we are deeply conscious of and that is something we are adhering to in the Reserve Bank even today.    II. Communication Challenges  18. The second issue I want to talk about is co mmunication challenges. There is a paper by Dr. Patel and I quote a sentence from the paper: \u201cApart from communicating its own slant on national and international trends, there are three special areas wh ich need attention. The first is the glamorous but elusive area of what the Central Bank communicates and how it does so in relation to its spec ific responsibility for monetary and foreign exchange policy; the seco nd is communication on issues in regard to its regulatory functions; an d the last is communication with the government of the day, including Parliament.\u201d  Oxymoron 19. I am deeply struck by this statement by Dr. Patel. Not so much by the content, not so much by the context, but by the fact that Dr. Patel chose to say it at all. Because in the time that Dr. Patel wrote this communi cation by central banks was an oxymoron.  20. As Dr. Patel himself admits: \u201cI belong to an age when central bank governors, like children, were supposed to be seen, not heard. Although they were allowed to smile in public, they had to emulate Mona Lisa and maintain an aura of mystery.\u201d  21. How is the Reserve Bank today going to be evaluated on the basis of  Dr. Patel\u2019s exhortation to be more mean ingfully communicative.   6 Alan Greenspan - the Doyen of Communication! 22. It would be blasphemous to speak about cen tral bank communication without first paying tribute to the doyen of communication - Alan  Greenspan. So let me get on with it.  23. I will not of course tell you the joke about his marriage proposal to his future wife. That\u2019s hackneyed.  24. Greenspan is notoriously famous for transf orming central bank communication to an art form. In 1987 shortly after he took over as Ch airman of the Federal Reserve, he said, \u201cSince I\u2019ve become a central banker I\u2019ve learne d to mumble with great incoherence. If I seem unduly clear to you, you must ha ve misunderstood what I said.\u201d  25. After nearly 15 years on the job, in Oct ober 2001, Greenspan took a complete U turn saying that, \u201cOpenness is more than just usef ul in shaping better economic performance. Openness is an obligation of a central bank in a free and democratic society. Transparency of our activities  is the means by which we ma ke ourselves accountable to our fellow citizens to aid them in judging whether we are worthy of that task\u201d.   IG Patel - Prescient  26. By commenting on communication, much before central bank communication became an intellectually fashionable issue, Dr. Pa tel had been remarkably prescient.  27. Let me comment on contemporary pe rspectives on communication policy.     7Why is Central Bank Communication Important?28.  Over the last two decades, central banks have moved towards clearer communication and greater transparency. This has been driven by several motivations.  29. First and foremost, central banks have realized that open and transparent communication enhances policy effectiveness by way of ach ieving expected outcom es. This shift in central bank theology from deliber ate obscurity to greater transp arency actually reflects a shift in the theory of monetary policy.   Robert Lucas  30. Up until the early 1990s, monetary policy was strongly influenced by Nobel Laureate Robert Lucas\u2019 argument that monetary policy a ffected real variables,  like growth, only if the policy changes were unanticipated. Th is encouraged obsc urity over openness and clarity. However, lost in the debate after Lucas' statement was the message that monetary policy always affected nominal variables like inflation, even if fully anticipated.   Two Nobel Laureates 31. In the 1980s, two economists, also Nobel wi nners, Finn Kydland and Ed Prescott, argued that fully transparent rules rather than discretionary policy were more efficient and credible. This was the begi nning of the push towards rules over discreti on and greater central bank transparency.     8Change in US Fed 32. The most eloquent illustration of  this shift from obscurity towards transparency is the change in the communication strategy of the US  Fed. It is hard to imagine from today\u2019s perspective, but prior to 1994, the US Fed di d not disclose the  Fed Funds Rate; the market was supposed to infer the rate from  the timing, sequencing and magnitude of the FED's open market operations.   33. In sharp contrast, today the Fed not only announces the rate but also gives a clear indication of future  policy trajectory.   Communication as Policy - Extended Period 34. Sometimes, communication, instead of being a vehicle for policy, becomes the policy itself. Drawing yet again from the US experience during the crisis, the Fed realized that its repeated announcement of k eeping rates low \u2018for an extended period\u2019 led markets to reach a certain inference on what \u2018extended pe riod\u2019 could mean. In this context, some policy analysts argued that a step that the Fed should modify the language of the statement to communicate to investors that it anticipates keeping the target Federal Funds rate low for a longer period than what the market s were factoring it to  be. In fact, the Fed did just that - by saying explicitly that the low interest rate regime will last into 2014, much more specific that what the market wanted.  35. Yet another factor that has motivated centr al banks into placing larger emphasis on communication is their hard earned autonomy in the years before the crisis. Central banks have increasingly embraced more open communi cation to counter the criticism that an  9autonomous central bank comprising unelected decision makers was inconsistent with a democratic structure.  Communication in Reserve Bank 36. In the Reserve Bank, we have tried to im prove communication not only on monetary policy but across the entire spectrum of our ma ndate. We have make efforts to demystify the Reserve Bank. 37. We continue to make explicit efforts to im prove the communication of the Reserve Bank.  (i) Streamlined the policy documents  (ii) Forward guidance - manage the risk that market does not ignore the conditionality and interpret the guidance on an irrevocable commitment.  (iii)Post-policy press conf erences and interviews  (iv) Teleconference with analysts  (v) Dissemination through our regional offices   (vi) On all areas, even extending beyond mone tary policy, we put out Discussion papers - New Bank licences - Most extensive communication exercise.  Dilemmas in Communication  38. It is not as if more comm unication is better communication. Even as central banks are becoming more communicative, they  are struggling with dilemmas: (i)  What do we tell? (ii)   How do we tell?  10(iii)  How much do we tell? 39. Dictum to central banks used to be what mothers across cultures and across time have always told their children - \u201cIf you can\u2019t say anything nice,  don\u2019t say anything at all.\u201d  40. But the drive for transparency has change d that. Now the dictum is: \u201chold back information only if it is absolutely necessary to hold it back.\u201d  41. It is a struggle that  we fight every day.  42. For example , the Financial Stability Reports \u2013  - True picture of th e financial sector - But that could trigger a disr uptive reaction and even panic - A situation that could be mana ged and contained can implode 43. That is a challenge that we in the Reserve Ba nk contend with, not about what to disclose but about how much to disclose and in what form to say it. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -           11III. Responsibility of the Governor to Speak Up 44. I will now talk about the re sponsibility of the Governor. I quote from Dr. Patel: \u201cBut the point is, when such vital questi ons arise, the Governor cannot just be inactive. He is a public serv ant with loyalty to the country and the Constitution - not just to a government in transit. And ye t, he cannot behave as if every issue is of great import. He has to choose his gr ound and be discreet above all. Without offending the government he can start a debate and steer the argument in a certain direction. His ultimate defense is  democracy and the tradition of free debate.\u201d   45. In short what Dr. Patel said was, don\u2019t nitpick. Pick your battles. Once you have picked your battles, fight t hose battles valiantly.  46. I want to pay a tribute to all my predecessor Governors who have followed this dictum. Several important reform measures in the c ountry and policy initiativ es owe their origin through the debates generated by the Governors. Of course, they are articulating the institutional wisdom of the Reserve Bank.  47. Over the last four years we have tried to raise a number of issues in the public domain because we believed that they needed to be debated: - role and responsibility of the Reserve Bank for financial stability.  - the importance of protecting the independe nce of the central bank and indeed of all regulators.  - the importance of being earnest about fiscal responsibility.  - setting exemplary standards for corporate governance.   1248. Government and the Reserve Bank are not adversaries. They share common goals. I think some disagreement is natural. There are di sagreements with the Government, there are disagreements between the Government and regu lators and public pol icy institutions. We know that wisdom arises out of disagreeme nt and debate. What we need is a wise mechanism for distilling wisdom out of this disagreement.  49. Dr. Patel rightly says that the ultimate de fence for the Governor and of course the Reserve Bank is democracy and tradition of free debate.   50. Central banks render accountability \u2013 partic ularly important because central bank officials are unelected and therefore have no electoral mandate. We take decisions that affect the entire country. So we must be sensitive to render accountab ility for our actions and the results of those actions.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -              13IV. Advising the Advisers 51. The final point I want to talk on is advising  the advisers. There is a short piece in the book, it is actually a book review that Dr. Pa tel wrote about Govern ment advisers. That struck a chord with me.  52. It is about role and responsibility of govern ment economists and their influence on public policy. Particularly important because Dr. Pa tel was among the first of economic advisers in the Government.   53. Dictum to economists in government has alwa ys been: \u201cfocus on objective analysis and give competent, unbiased and professiona l advice. Do not wo rry about political feasibility.\u201d   54. What struck me while reading th is is that this is precisely the value system taught to civil servants:  - Your job is to advise the political ex ecutive on policy and to implement that policy diligently.  - You shouldn\u2019t be biased by politics - Indeed you shouldn\u2019t be biased by any extraneous consideration - Give your professional advice and le t the political executive decide  55. With over 35 years experience as a civil servan t, I am beginning to be sceptical about this paradigm. Is it not too strait jacketed?   56. Should the civil servant limit himself to givi ng objective advice or should he also be concerned about its feasibility?  14 57. If the civil servant suggests options that are totally infeasible, they are not adding value. They are only making life more difficu lt for the political executive.   58. New theory - you give honest, dispassionate ad vice. But in doing so, be sensitive to the democratic feasibility of  the solution you suggest.   59. I am not saying that civil servants should be  politicised or be less than honest. Only saying that they should suggest practical, work able, democratically feasible solutions.    60. Question in the context of  Dr. Patel\u2019s piece is   - Is the code of conduct for government ec onomists any different from that for bureaucrats?  - In other words, should government economists also tailor their advice based on feasibility, or leave that to be determ ined by the bureaucracy and the political executives?            15Conclusion 61. I have commented on a few issues raised by Dr. Patel (i) the objective of monetary policy  (ii) communication challenges of central banks  (iii) responsibility of  the Governor to generate public debate  on vital public policy issues  (iv) the code of conduct for government advisers  62. These articles have been written over a long period - (i) World has changed (ii) World views have changed (iii)India has changed (iv) The Reserve Bank has changed (v) Economics has changed  Value System  63. What has not changed in all this flux is the value system that must guide public servants. 64. It is that value system that Dr. I.G. Patel embodied in full. 65. The Reserve Bank is proud of the legacy left  behind by Dr. Patel and is delighted to renew its association with him through this book launch.  66. Congratulations to the editors Dr. Deena Khatkhate Dr. Y.V. Reddy 67. Thanks once again to Mrs. Patel and Oxford  University Press for this opportunity.  16", "25 Apr 09 MP.pdf": "  Statement by Mr. Duvvuri Subbarao, Alternate Governor  (On behalf of Mr. Palaniappan Chidambaram, Member, IMFC representing the Constituency consisting of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Sri Lanka)  Leader of the Indian Delegation to the International Monetary and Financial Committee Washington D.C, April 25, 2009  Mr. Chairman,   1. The IMFC meets today in extraordinarily complex and challenging times.  The financial crisis became full-blown in the second half of 2008, and has morphed through negative feedback to real activity, plunging the global economy into the deepest recession since World War II. What started off as a s ub-prime crisis in the US housing mortgage sector has turned successively into a global banking crisis, global financial crisis and now a global economic crisis  spreading from the l ittoral Atlantic regions across the world to Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and most  unfortunately, to Africa. The crisis now threatens the recent gains in human livelihood and well-being. It also challenges many of our fundamental beliefs about economic resili ence and financial  market stability.    The Global Economy and Financial Markets  2. The most frequently asked question today is whether the worst is behind us.  While there are incipient signs of business confidence and consumer spending trying to gain toehold, rising unemployment, high inventories and financial stress weigh heavily on overall demand conditions. In financial markets, although spreads have narrowed from September 2008 levels, they remain elevated while bank credit has declined and other markets remain impaired. The estimates of th e expected write-downs by banks on global exposures are rising rapidly.  For all financia l institutions taken together, the expected write-downs over 2007-10 is estimated at $ 2.8 trillion on US-based assets and $ 1.4 trillion in Europe and Japan. The retrenchment from emerging markets is outpacing the overall de-leveraging that is underway, rais ing serious concerns about refinancing and even default risks.   3. Global economic activity is expected to contract by an annualized 6 percent in the first quarter of 2009 \u2013 the same as in the f ourth quarter of 2008. Policy making around the world is in clearly uncharted territory.  Governments and central banks across countries have responded to the crisis through big,  aggressive and unconventional measures. Emboldened by falling inflation, monetary authorities in advanced countries have cut policy rates to unprecedented lows and when credit markets failed to thaw, central bank balance sheets have been expanded alongside funding and guarantees to financial intermediaries. Fiscal stimuli have been employed in conjunction, with large discretionary impulses boosting automatic stabilizers. Even with current levels of policy intensity the trough of the global recession is not seen until the end of 2009 and could get pushed out further if the policy responses fail to gain traction.    2 4. While the recession has intensified in the advanced economies, emerging economies have been dented by the collapse in external demand and commodity prices, the tightening constraints on access to external financing and the retrenchment of capital flows. Emerging and developing economies could experience capital outflows of the order of 1 percent of GDP in 2009 with growth expected to slump to 1.5 percent. Their prospects could indeed worsen if external financing constraints tighten further, trade and financial protectionism escalates and stress in domestic financial systems heightens and spreads.    5. Inflation is subsiding across the world with cooling demand and weakening commodity prices; however, this has not transl ated into gains in purchasing power in the face of high job losses and eroded profit margins for firms.  In many emerging economies, this has resulted in overvaluati on of currencies, partly reflecting the appreciation in the key reserve currencies.  As international reserves have been drawn down to stabilize foreign exchange markets, the cushion against the global crisis has been eroded further.   6. Current estimates of write-downs on toxi c assets suffered by banks globally are highly contingent on the hope that the global ec onomic situation does not worsen further. Of the write-downs of $ 3 trillion only a third has been capitalized. Uncertainty about potential losses has kept spreads in financial markets elevated with the securities market still impaired and the credit market yet to thaw. In this context the key challenge is to impart credibility to a restructuring strategy comprising, loss recognition; realistic valuation; cleansing balance sheets; and reca pitalization and distress resolution.  These issues need to be speedily addressed so that economic recovery takes root in the mature economies and capital flows to emerging and developing economies are revived.   The Role and Response of the Fund  7. The sharp deterioration in the global economic and financial situation has evoked vanguard national efforts towards crisis resolution on a scale, mix and duration that is perhaps unprecedented in recent history. With the G20 Leaders\u2019 Summits in Washington in November, 2008 and in London earlier this month providing direction, a more comprehensive multilateral response involving a range of institutions, with the Fund in the forefront, has now been crafted.    Surveillance  8. Core to the very existence of the IMF is its surveillance role - monitoring global, regional and national economies to assess wh ether countries' policie s are consistent not only with their own interest but also with the interest of the international community. The on-going crisis has highlighted the relevance and importance of strengthening and appropriately focusing Fund\u2019s surveillance. I reiterate the need for greater focus on systemically important countries - the more systemically important the country the greater should be the rigour of surveillance.  In para llel, the gap between multilateral and bilateral surveillance should be bridged. The IMF\u2019s surv eillance should not add to the obligations of developing countries.  9. While the Fund\u2019s traditional emphasis has been on exchange rates, the crisis has pushed macro-financial sector issues onto centr e-stage in IMF surveillance. A key aspect   3 is the integration of macroeconomic and financial sector surveillance.  The Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) should be made more focused and forward-looking so that it could be integrated more e ffectively into bilateral surveillance. National authorities are closer to the terrain realities of their financial sectors and self-assessment of regulatory frameworks based on internat ionally agreed methodologies should be a priority.  As we have learnt, prescription of standards for the financ ial sector in itself cannot prevent crises.  There is a need for on-going review of the standards by international bodies and greater national commitment for implementation. National authorities should also commit to assist each other in enhancing their capacity to strengthen regulatory frameworks and the IMF has a crucial role to play in this coordination.    10. The IMF  has recently stepped up its co llaboration with the expanded Financial Stability Board on developing a framework on early warnings for identifying and mitigating systemic risks and vulnerabilities.  We welcome this collaboration and while recognizing the potential utility of the exercise, we look forward to more details, particularly on the methodology. Strengthening information availability is a key pre-requisite. The effectiveness of this colla boration should be regularly reviewed by the IMFC.  Lending Role of the Fund  11. The Fund as a financing institution should have the lending instruments and the financing capacity to address potential borrowing needs.  We welcome the proactive and prompt measures taken by the Fund to reform its lending instruments and policies.  The introduction of the Flexible Credit Line (FCL ) and the high access precautionary stand-by arrangements (HAPAs) are timely, positive steps.  The streamlining of modalities for applying Fund conditionality, including greater use of ex-ante  conditionality, appropriately balance the financing needs of the membership with safeguards for Fund resources.   12. These reforms could enable the Fund to re -emerge as the financier of choice not only for balance of payments needs and programmes designed for macroeconomic stability and structural adjustment, but for insurance in these uncertain times. Many member countries who were far removed from the epicentre and had no role or responsibility in the making of the crisis have nevertheless been adversely affected by it.  The Fund would have to assist them and ensure that the fallout of the crisis in emerging markets and developing countries is contained.   We expect that these facilities will be implemented in an appropriately flexible manner. The Fund should work closely with its membership to ensure that support is provided in   a timely manner to prevent crises at an early stage. In this context, the initial response to the FCL is heartening.   13. We also welcome the initiative of the Fund to reform the financing instruments for low income countries (LICs) to better reflect their diverse needs and circumstances and heightened exposure to global volatility. Ap propriate precautionary arrangements with higher access levels and ex-ante condition ality  for strong performers amongst low income countries also warrant consideration. We call for an early completion of this exercise.   The doubling of access limits for concessional lending, including the rapid access component of the Exogenous Shocks F acility (ESF), is a good interim measure.     4 14. We also support the initiatives that are underway to bridge the gaps in trade financing and restore normalcy to markets for trade finance flows and rollovers. We urge the IMF to collaborate with other internationa l financial institutions  (IFIs) and bilateral agencies to support a truly multilateral effort . The unimpeded flow of trade financing to low income countries for imports of essentia l items such as food, fertilizer, fuel and capital goods should also be ensured.   Augmenting the IMF\u2019s Resources  15. In response to the increasing demand for Fund financing to manage the crisis the London Summit of G20 Leaders rightly focused on measures to enhance the resources available with the Fund.  These decisi ons should be speedily implemented.    16. The Fund is a quota based organization and quotas have to be the primary mechanism through which the resource needs of  the Fund are ultimately met.  This calls for two tasks on the way forward.  The first task is to ensure that the April 2008 package of quota and voice reform is ratified at the earliest. The second task is advancing the completion of the 14th General Review of Quotas from January 2013 to January 2011. This quota review should, at the minimum, aim at doubling the quota resources. A time-sliced work plan should be laid down, commencing at the earliest so that the quota review can be completed in the targeted year and a half time frame.  17. Since the process of increasing and allocating quotas could take some time, the Fund is working on securing alternate resources, including borrowing.  We support these efforts but these should be seen as bridging mechanisms until the quota review is complete.   18. We appreciate the bilateral commitments made so for.  We believe that the Fund\u2019s borrowings should adhere to certain key principles, consistent with the London Summit decisions.  First, the Fund\u2019s borrowings should not be seen as a substitute for a substantial quota increase.  Second, an appropriate mix should be maintained between the quota resources and borrowings of the Fund.  Third, Fund borrowings should be based broadly on present quota shares, preferably within a multilateral framework like a modified NAB.  Fourth, to provide greater flexibility for me mber countries to contribute to the Fund\u2019s resources,  various modalities should be expl ored, including note purchase mechanisms.  Fifth, resources lent to the Fund should be treated as part of the country\u2019s international reserves.    19. An early decision on these modalities would enable a quicker mobilization of the targeted resources from a wider group of member s. On our part, India is prepared to take on its share of responsibility to augment the Fund\u2019s resources.  We would be able to commit on the extent of participation once the modalities are evolved in keeping the principles enunciated.   20. We call for an early and front-loaded  allocation of SDRs worth $250 billion which would amount to about three-quarters of the present quota size of the Fund.  This would provide developing countries with additional liquidity of about $100 billion, of which $ 19 billion will go to low income countries.  There is a need to widen and deepen the market for SDRs through an expansion of th e voluntary agreements.  An SDR allocation   5 is a reversible measure and the allocati on could be re-considered when the global economic situation shows significant improvement.   21. We call on the Fund to finalize the modalities for raising both loan and subsidy resources for concessional assistance to low income countries. A number of available options need to be explored.  We support th e proposal to utilise the additional income from the investment of the higher proceeds of the agreed gold sale under the New Income Model to expand subsidized lending to low income countries. Members participating in the multilateral borrowing arrangements with the Fund should have the option of earmarking a portion of their lending for assistance to low income countries. Vigorous efforts to increase donor contributions to the subsidy resources should be pursued.    Governance  22. Governance continues to be critical to the legitimacy, credibility and effectiveness of the Fund.  The most crucial issue is the continuance of the process of realignment of quotas and voice. The ensuing quota review should ensure that  the IMF is comprehensively reformed so that it reflects the changing economic weights in the world economy and is more responsive to futu re challenges. Emerging and developing economies should have substantially greater voi ce and representation in the Fund.  This principle was reiterated in the Washington D eclaration of the G20 Leaders and endorsed by the London Summit as well.  We now expect that the quota review will result in a comprehensive reform of the governance of the Fund.  23. The initiative towards internal governance reform within the Fund is also relevant, although it should follow the quota and voice reform.  We now have the Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) report on Corporate Governance, the report of the Trevor Manuel Committee, and the inputs from civil society.  We expect that these inputs would be thoroughly analyzed and discussed in the Executive Board and appropriate recommendations for action would be made so that the IMFC could become a more effective forum and the Fund is also strengthened.  24. We call for the introduction of an open,  merit-based process, irrespective of nationality and geographical preferences, for the selection of the senior management of the Fund. The next Managing Director of th e IMF should be selected in this manner.  Developments in the Constituency  25. I now turn to developments in my constituency.   India  26. The global financial crisis interrupted India\u2019s growth momentum.  Since downside risks have materialized, the GDP growth for 2008-09 is now projected to turn out to be in the range of 6.5 to 6.7 per cent after clocking annual growth of 8.9 per cent on an average over the preceding five years (2003-08). Domestic demand, in the form of both private consumption and investment expenditure , has slackened although government final consumption rose on account of discretionary fiscal stimulus measures. The global crisis brought to the fore the strong interactions between funding liquidity and market conditions. Both the Government and the Reserve Bank responded to the challenge of   6 minimising the impact of the crisis on India in a coordinated and consultative manner.  The Reserve Bank\u2019s policy response was aimed at containing the contagion from the global financial crisis while  maintaining comfortable domestic and forex liquidity. The Government launched three fiscal stimulus packages which came on top of an already announced expanded safety-net programme for the rural poor, the farm loan waiver package and payout following the Sixth Pay Commission report. The combined impact of these fiscal measures is about 3 percent of GDP.  Through the Reserve Bank\u2019s actions, the cumulative amount of primary liquidity potentially available to the financial system is about 7 percent of GDP.  There are several challenges on the way forward : implementing the fiscal stimulus packages, particularly stepping up public investment; revival of private investment demand; unwinding of fiscal stimulus in an orderly manner; maintaining the flow of credit while ensuring credit quality; preserving financial stability along with provision of adequate liquidity; and ensuring an interest rate environment that supports the return of the economy to a high growth path.   27. Going forward, the fiscal and monetary stimulus measures initiated during 2008-09 coupled with lower commodity prices will cushion the downturn by stabilising domestic economic activity. On balance, with the assumption of normal monsoon, real GDP growth for 2009-10 is placed at around 6.0 per cent.  Inflation, as measured by variations in WPI, is projected to be around 4.0 by end March, 2010.  Consumer price inflation too is declining, albeit less sharply.  Notwithstanding several challenges, the Indian economy remains resilient with we ll functioning markets and sound financial institutions.  The macro-economic management has helped in maintaining lower volatility in both financial and real sectors in India re lative to several other advanced and emerging market economies.  Sri Lanka  28. The Sri Lankan economy was resilient in the face of unfavourable external conditions and registered growth of 6.0 percent in 2008.  High oil and import commodity prices threatened macroeconomic stability resu lting in a sharply widening current account deficit and rapidly rising inflation.  The global financial turmoil triggered a reversal of capital inflows causing a depletion of reserves and substantial imbalances in the external sector.  Despite these challenging circumstances, prudent macroeconomic policies supported the growth momentum while headli ne inflation dropped to 5.2 percent in March 2009 from a high of 28.2 percent in July 2008.  The fiscal deficit has remained at a reasonably low level and public debt relative to GDP has been on the decline for the fourth consecutive year. Unemployment has dropped to a historic low of 5.2 percent while poverty has been falling for the last several years and is currently around 15.0 percent. Against the back drop of a deterior ating global outlook, growth is expected to drop sharply but would remain around 4.0 percent in 2009, bolstered by prudent macroeconomic policies and expansion of th e domestic economy particularly in the eastern and northern provinces of the country.   As normalcy returns, optimism about a resumption of the high growth trajectory and a step-up in the developmental process is gaining ground.   Bangladesh  29. Bangladesh\u2019s economy has stood up well in the face of the surge in international food and commodity prices in the first half of 2008 and the outbreak of the global crisis   7 since September 2008. Real GDP growth is expected to remain strong in 2008-09 (July-June) at around 6.0 percent, benefiting from a favourable agricultural performance and the fall in food, fuel and commodity prices in the second half of the year. As a result and reinforced by a combination of supply management and monetary-fiscal policies, inflation fell on a year-on-year basis to 6.1 percent in January 2009 from 11.4 percent a year ago. Public finances have come under some strain with growth in tax revenues falling short of target which is being offs et by reduced expenditure due to sluggish demand and lower Annual Development Plan utilization. With the deepening global downturn affecting major export markets, Bangladesh\u2019s balance of payments has come under some pressure, aggravated by some slowing down of remittances although they continue to hold up well. Gross international reserves stood at US $ 5.9 billion at the end of February 2009, close to three months of imports. Bangladesh has also welcomed the decisions of the G 20 to deal with the current crisis within a multilateral framework while shunning trade protectionism and competitive devaluations. Bangladesh is striving to weather the crisis with a modest stimulus package aimed at boosting domestic demand with investment in rural, agricultural and infrastructure sectors, propping up the export sectors, buttressing food and social security measures and undertaking additional employment programmes.  Bhutan  30. In Bhutan , 2008 was a year of momentous historical significance when the country transitioned into a constitutional monarchy with new democratic institutions.  This provides the backdrop for the impl ementation of the development agenda.  Financing for the 10th Plan, which aims to double development spending with a focus on poverty reduction through industrial development, balanced regional growth and infrastructure investment has been tied up.  Real GDP growth in 2007/08 was 21.4 per cent reflecting the doubling of hydro power generation capacity with the coming on stream of the Tala hydro project.  GDP growth rate is expected to return to a trend level of 5.6 per cent in 2008-09.   Regional integration through enhanced trade relationships with neighbouring countries, especially India and Bangladesh are helping growth and diversification. On the external sector, while reserves of convertible currency are comfortable, rupee reserves require careful management to meet the needs for imports.  Concluding Remarks  31. The crisis has put to test the collective leadership of the world and the competence and relevance of multilateral institutions.  We are grappling with a crisis that has afflicted the entire world whether at the core or in the periphery. Much depends on a quick and internationally coordinated approach to a daunting, but not an insurmountable, challenge. The IMF is central to this endeavour and all of us have a stake in the role of the Fund in orchestrating the road to rec overy. The Fund\u2019s capacity to de liver is ultimately connected to how much and how soon we empower it wi th resources, better governance, greater accountability and a redefined mandate that keeps pace with the requirements of the changing world. Within the IMF too, a radical shift in approach, culture and strategy is urgently warranted so that it divests itself of its past and much of the fallibility that goes with it. The world we will emerge into after the crisis will in all likelihood not be the same again, and the challenge is to re-fashion the IMF so that it becomes more relevant, useful  and effective in the future.   ", "29 June 09 MP.pdf": " 1Sub-national Fiscal Reforms and Debt  Management - Indian Experience1  Shyamala Gopinath  It gives me great pleasure to be here amongst you and address the World Bank Sub-national Fiscal Reform and Debt Management  Forum. There is more than one reason on my part to accept this invitation, but more importan tly, to share with you the turnaround story at the sub-national level in I ndia. The relevance of fiscal reforms and creation of fiscal space even at the sub-na tional level can hardly be over-emphasised in the context of the on-going slowdown th e world over. Indeed , contrary to the general perceptions, we find in India that  even the sub-nationa l authori ties have important counter-cyclical role to play. Inte restingly, the Reserve Bank of India as the debt manager of Governments \u2013 federal and provincial \u2013 has all through been closely associated with the task of putting in pl ace a reformed fiscal architecture in the country. Let me now share with you the details , which run into eight sections, the first being the Constitutional position of the sub-national Governments. In the absence of firm data on local bodies (the  third tier of government in  India), the analysis is confined to the level of provinc ial governments.          I. Constitutional Provisions and Debt Management The Constitution of Indi a has adopted a federal system of polity and governance, originally envisaging a two-ti er structure: Central (i.e., federal) Government and State (i.e., provincial) Governments. With the Constitution (73rd and 74th) Amendment Acts, 1992, Local Self-Governme nt Institutions (LSGIs), i.e., rural and urban local bodies have been accorded constitutional status as the third-tier of Government. The Constitution provides fo r preparation of annual budgets and borrowings by the Centre, respectively, unde r Articles 112 and 292 and by the States under Articles 202 and 293.  The Constitution assigns important res ponsibilities to the States in many sectors such as agricultural  development, infrastructure , poverty alleviation, water supply and irrigation, public order, public health and sanitation. States have also concurrent jurisdiction in areas like e ducation, electricity, economic and social planning and family planning. In addition to provision of general administration, State Governments thus provide various social and economic services and also transfer resources to the third tier of government \u2013 rural and ur ban local bodies such as municipalities. In keeping w ith larger responsibilities as signed to the States, their expenditure accounts for a substantial portion of the Government sector expenditure (Centre plus States) in India and sta nds higher than in several other countries such as Australia, Denmark, Argentina, USA a nd Germany (World Bank, 2005). While the State Governments collect about one-third of the total Government s ector receipt, they incur more than three-fourths of the total e xpenditure on social se rvices and more than half of that on economic services.  The States\u2019 ability to undertake and perform the developmental functions adequately and effectively is critically predicated on their fiscal position, which is a                                                  1 Paper presented at the  workshop on \u2018Sub-national Fiscal Reform and Debt Management\u2019, April 29, 2009, Washington, organised by the Economic Policy and Debt Department, World Bank. Assistance provided by Sanjay Hansda and Arghya Mitra in preparation of the paper is gratefully acknowledged.    2function of their own efforts in genera ting resources \u2013 tax, non-tax receipts and borrowings as also the resource tran sfer from the Central Government.  Sub-National Borrowings  Article 293 of the Indian Constituti on imposes certain re strictions on the borrowings by State Governments. The Article stipulates that a State may not, without the consent of the Government of India,  raise any borrowings if it has any loan outstanding, which is repayabl e to the Government of India. Furthermore, under the Constitution, State governments, unlike the Centre, cannot borrow externally. The Centre plays the role of an intermediary in the transfer of external borrowings to States.  Because of these controls exercised by the Centre, there is  not much scope for fiscal profligacy at the State level and accordingly, there have been no instance of bankruptcy by any State Government. This also represents the largely unitary structure of the Indian federal polity de spite the significantly important Constitutional roles that have been assigned to  the sub-national Governments.  The major heads of borrowings by States  include: (i) open market borrowings, (ii) special securities issued to National Small Savings Fund (NSSF), (iii) loans from banks and financial institutions (negotiated loans), (iv) loans from the Centre, (v) State Provident Funds, (vi) deposits a nd advances and (vii) reserve funds.    Loans from Centre  \u2018Loans from the Centre\u2019, which used to be a major source of State finances have since lost its significance.    Special Securities is sued to National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) The Central Government has set up th e NSSF, which is akin to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) providing an au tonomous source of finance for the Governments. It mobilises small savings through post offices and banks and lends against special non-tradable secu rities issued by the States  and the Centre as per the proportion fixed by the latter. The loans have a maturity of 25 year s with an initial moratorium of five years in the repayment of principal. One-twentieth of the amount is repaid every year beginning from the si xth year. The special securities currently carry a rate of interest of 9.5%, as fixed by the Centre, resulting in a spread of around 1.5% for the Centre. While repayments to the NSSF are generally made out of fresh accretion, net outflows since 2007-08 have e xposed the NSSF to ALM mismatches.    Open Market Borrowings The market-borrowing programme of  the State Governments (as also borrowings by way of negotiated loans and Central loans) is finalised by the Government of India and the Planning Comm ission, keeping in view the provisions of Article 293(3) of the Constitution of India. Once the Government of India indicates, generally at the beginn ing of the fiscal, the size of Stat e-wise net allocation of market borrowings to the Reserve Bank, the Ba nk decides on the timing and volume of issues, taking into account the market and liquidity conditions and the cash needs of the States.   Debt Management in 1990s In terms of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Bank acts as the fiscal agent and the debt manager to the State Governments by way of mutual agreement.  3Accordingly, the RBI is the banker to 26 States while it is the debt manager to all the 28 States. During the 1990s, the Reserve Ba nk used to complete the combined borrowing programme of all the States gene rally in two or more  tranches through issue of bonds with a pre- determined coupon and pre-notif ied amounts for each State (Traditional Tranche Method ).  High statutory pre-emptio n in the form of statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) and the small size of  State Government borrowings ensured the success of these primary issues.  In 1997, State Governments were give n the option to enter the market individually to raise resources using the tap method or the  auction method . In 1999, States began to adopt the auction method and some States were able to mobilise loans at competitive rates, whereas other States had to pay higher rates. The spreads in tap tranches were subsequently  raised to around 50 basis po ints in 2001-02 from 25 basis points earlier with the introduction of Umbrella Tap Tranche  for a total targeted amount at a predetermined coupon. The tap us ed to be normally kept open for 1-3 days. With the deterioration in the Stat e fisc and defaults in State guaranteed securities, the spread over secondary mark et yield of Central Government security increased steadily. The market seemed to ha ve ceased to differen tiate amongst States in terms of their fiscal performance. Th e share of market borrowings by auctions declined from 15.0 per cent during 2001-02 to 2.3 per cent in 2004-05 and the Reserve Bank had to play an active role in convincing some of the leading players to subscribe to State Government securities.   II. Fiscal Decline of the States in Late 1980s During the 1970s and the first half of th e 1980s, States had a relatively healthy fiscal position.  The buoyant growth in St ates taxes particularly sales tax contributed to a surplus in the revenue account between the mid-1970s and the mid-1980s. Although the States slashed their investment activiti es faced with revenue deficit from 1987-88, their debt and debt servicing burden soared  with the high cost borrowing financing current expenditure amidst growing fis cal imbalances during 1986-87 to 1997-98. Fiscal imbalances worsened after 1998- 99 following a sizeable pay hike of the employees in sequel to the implemen tation of the Fifth Pay Commission\u2019s recommendations at the State level. States  faced mounting pension burden which in case of many States increased at a faster ra te than salaries. Interest burden also grew steadily warranting increasing borrowings to bridge the GFD. The GFD of States deteriorated sharply from 2.9 per cent in 1997-98 to 4.6 per cent in 1999-2000 before declining marginally to 4.4 per cent in 2003-04. By 2003-04, the aggregate liabilities of States peaked at 33.2 percent of GDP from 20.9 per cent in 1996-97. The burgeoning fiscal gap fed on itself as the ratio of interest payments to revenue receipts of States deteriorated sharply from 1 3.0 per cent in 1990-91 to 26.0 per cent in 2003-04.  The structural imbalance in State finances stemmed from their limited resource base vis-\u00e0-vis grow ing expenditure. The narrow tax base of the States with greater reliance on indirect taxes such as sales tax and the lack of harmonised inter-State tax structure allowed di stortions and rigidities to  emerge in late 1980s. The States\u2019 own tax revenue which financed 32.2%  of the total expe nditure in 1980s has shown only a marginal rise to 34.5% in 1990s. The internal resource mobilisation by the States was further constrained by stagnant  user charges as also the fact that the State PSUs such as the State Electricity  Boards (SEBs) and State Transport Undertakings were running in to losses. Given the relative ly higher responsibility for the States for social and economic developmen t, the resulting fiscal gap is financed,  4among others, by vertical resource transfer fr om the Centre to the States. However, the resource flow from the Centre decel erated from 15.2% in 1980s to 14.5% in 1990s following the fiscal reforms initiated by th e Centre. The deceleration in transfers emerged despite an increase in the proportion of tax transfers recommended by various Finance Commissions. This reflec ted the low level of buoyancy in both income tax and union excise du ties, the then two components of shareable taxes with States.   III. Sub-National Fiscal Reforms Reflecting the fiscal stress, the expenditu re for developmental activities, which are directly related to gr owth, has suffered; on the ot her hand, expenditure on non-developmental purposes, largely committed, has witnessed a steady rise. Fiscal adjustment based predominantly on expenditure reduction may have adverse implications for growth, particularly when  government expenditure in India is lower than that in the OECD countries. It was fe lt that fiscal stra tegy based on revenue maximisation could provide necessary flexibili ty to the pattern of expenditure. Thus, sub-national fiscal adjustment started in  late 1990s as follows, motivated, among others, by the reform-linked assistance (i) fr om the Centre as part of the Medium-Term Fiscal Reform Programme in line with the Eleventh Finance Commission and (ii) from the multilateral agencies.   (i) Tax Reforms States initiated several measures towards enhancement/restructuring of the taxes within their fold, such as, land revenue , vehicle tax, entertai nment tax, sales tax, electricity duty, tax on trades and professi onal tax. It was recogni sed that competitive sales tax reductions for attracting invest ment led to revenue losses without commensurate gains. With a view to harmonising inter-State taxes and ultimately switch over to State-level valu e added tax (VAT), States initially introduced uniform floor rate during 2000 before finally switchi ng over to the Value Added Tax (VAT) in  lieu of sales tax between Ap ril 2005 and January 2008, which has been an unqualified success in raising the tax revenue for the States.  (ii) Non-tax Measures States also undertook measures to enhance non-tax revenues by reviewing/rationalising the r oyalties payable to them, in cluding those on major and minor minerals, forestry and wildlife, revisi on of tuition fees, medi cal fees, irrigation water rates and tariffs on urban water supply. The issue of user charges since not in commensurate with the cost of public se rvices continues to be a concern.   (iii) Expenditure Management The State Governments\u2019 measures to contain expenditure, inter alia, include restrictions on fresh recr uitment/creation of new pos ts, review of manpower requirements and cut in establishment expe nses and reduction in  non-merit subsidies through better targeting.  (iv) Public Sector Restructuring Several States have shown interest in undertaking a comprehensive review of the functioning of the Stat e Public Sector Undertak ings (SPSUs), including the possibility of closing down of non-viable un its after providing for suitable safety-nets to the employees including VRS. States enc ouraged private sector participation in the  5transport and power genera tion sectors, set up the St ate Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) and pursued with unbund ling or corporatisation of the SEBs. One of the major tasks entrusted to the SERC is to rationalise tariff rates. Further, the States have signed Memorandum of Understa nding (MoU) with the Union Ministry of Power to undertake reforms in a time-bound manner.  (v) Institutional Reforms Faced with mounting deficits and market  fatigue in States\u2019 borrowings, States embarked on a rule-based pursuit of fiscal reforms by enacting the fiscal responsibility legislation (FRL), first by Karnataka (2002) and followed by Kerala, Punjab and Tamil Nadu (all in 2003). Uttar Pradesh enacted FRL in 2004. The enactment of FRL was incentivised by th e Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC) and all but two States have enacted FRLs by May 2007. Follo wing the recommendations of the Core Group on Voluntary Disclosure  Norms for State Governments (2001), States are being sensitised to the principl e of transparency in Government operations so as to ensure macro fiscal sustainabili ty and fiscal rectitude. States have since enhanced transparency in State budgets. Some  of the States also provide details on outstanding guarantees. In addition, a few States have started disseminating information on consolidated budgetary pos ition, which are inclusive of off-budget borrowings.  IV. Finance Commissions and State Finances Under article 280 of the C onstitution, the President of India appoints a Finance Commission every five years. The Commission is charged with making recommendations to the President on the distribution of the taxes between the Centre and the States and the consequent distribut ion among the States themselves. It also recommends grants in aid to States and suggest measures to strengthen the functioning of the third tie r governments comprising of Panchayati Raj  (for rural areas) and Municipal bodies  (for urban areas).   11th Finance Commission In pursuance of the recommendations of the Eleventh Finance Commission (EFC), the Central Government set up an Incentive Fund for State fiscal reforms. Each State was given the target of a mi nimum improvement of 5% in the revenue deficit as a proportion of their revenue receipt each year till 2004-05. For States with a revenue surplus, 3% improvement in the ba lance in the current revenue was required for release of funds under this facility. A ccordingly, several State Governments drew up Medium-Term Fiscal Reforms Programme (MTFRP) and entered into MoUs with the Union Ministry of Finance. The MTFRP of States covered various areas such as fiscal consolidation, public sector enterpri ses reform, power/irrigation sector reforms and fiscal transparency.  12th Finance Commission The subsequent Twelfth Finance Comm ission (TFC) felt that it would be appropriate for the States to take advantag e of the prevailing market rates and avoid the spread charged by the Centre on the a ssistance provided by it. The pattern of Central assistance included loan as a majo r element in respect of general category States, which was implicitly funded from borrowings by the Centre and hence, the terms of loans extended to the States refl ected the Centre\u2019s cost of borrowings. The TFC, therefore, recommended that the Ce ntral Government should not act as an  6intermediary for future lending and allow the St ates to approach the market directly. If some fiscally weak States were unable to  raise funds from th e market, the Centre could borrow for the purpose of  on-lending to such States, bu t the interest rates should remain aligned to the marginal cost of borrowing for the Centre. This approach was accepted by the Central Government, in princi ple, to be implemented in phases, in consultation with the Reserve Bank.  Second, the TFC recommended back-to-back transfer of external assistance to the States from the Centre with the States  having to bear full exchange rate risk. Third, the TFC recommended a fiscal restru cturing plan based on the enactment of fiscal responsibility legislation, inter alia , including (i) elimination of revenue deficit (RD) by 2008-09 and (ii) containment of gro ss fiscal deficit (GFD ) to 3.0 per cent of GSDP. If the States are able to fulfil these requirements, they would be entitled to debt relief including debt write-off in respect of Central loans.  Implementation of 12th Finance Commission\u2019s Recommendations  In order to operationalise the new a rrangements, the Government of India constituted a Technical Group under my chai rmanship, which submitted its report in December 2005 and made several recomme ndations. Accordingly, there has been progress in adoption of the auction method for borrowing by the States. In addition, State Development Loans (SDLs) were made  eligible for repo tr ansactions under the liquidity adjustment facility of the RBI in April 2007 and it has been decided to introduce the non-competitive bi dding facility in respect of  the primary auctions of SDLs.  The Central Government, on its part, init iated several measures to ease the debt burden of States: (i) the Debt Swap  Scheme (2002-03 to 2004-05), (ii) Debt Consolidation and Relief Facility (DCRF) (effective fiscal 2005-06) that allowed rescheduling of central loans at a reduced rate of interest of 7.5 per cent and debt waiver (subject to enactment of FRL a nd adherence to revenue deficit reduction targets) and (iii) reduction of interest ra te on securities issued to NSSF during 1999-2000 to 2001-02 carrying interest rate of 11.0-13.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent (effective fiscal 2007-08). Further, in accordance with the decision of the National Development Council, the obligatory share of the States  in the NSSF has been reduced to 80 per cent from 2007-08.  As regards borrowings from banks a nd financial institutions (negotiated loans), it is our view that such borrowi ngs, negotiated by States  on a bilateral basis with lenders, overlap with open market borro wings as the lenders belong to the same set of market participants. The Reserve Ba nk is the debt manager for all the 28 State Governments by entering into voluntary agre ement with them and the States should, therefore, confine their ba nking requirements with the Reserve Bank an d not borrow from other banks.    Consolidated Sinking Fund At the request of the State Governme nts, the Reserve Bank had prepared a model Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF) Sc heme and circulated it amongst them for adoption / consideration in 1999. The Twelfth Finance Commission had recommended that the CSF may cover repaymen ts in respect of all the loans of the State Governments (and not just open mark et borrowings). Agains t this backdrop, the Reserve Bank circulated a revised mode l scheme of CSF amongst the State Governments in May 2006 and of the 18 St ates that have set up CSF, 14 States adopted the revised CSF scheme. As at end-March 2009, the outstanding balance of  7the State Governments in CSF is Rs.240 b illion accounting for about 1.5 per cent of the outstanding liabilities of  the State Governments.   Prepayment of Debt The upsurge in the surplus cash balances  of the State Governments since the middle of 2004-05, in sharp contrast to the liq uidity pressures witnessed in the earlier period, posed newer challenges to the fina ncial and cash management of the State Governments. In the context of build up of cash balances which involve a negative carry, a few States proposed to utilise thei r surplus cash to pre-pay a part of their outstanding open market debt. Accordin gly, the RBI conducted two rounds of buyback auctions in respect  of two States in 2006- 07. During 2007-08, buy-back of securities was carried out for a State us ing the anonymous electronic trading (NDS-OM) platform.   Thirteenth Finance Commission   The Thirteenth Finance Commission (T hFC) since constitu ted in November 2007 is expected to submit its report by October 2009. Its recommendations would be applicable for five years (2010-11 to 2014-15). The Commission would make recommendations on the distri bution of the taxes between the Centre and the States and among the States, grants in aid to Stat es, and suggest measur es to strengthen the functioning of the third tier governme nts. The ThFC will also consider, inter alia , the impact of the proposed implementation of G oods and Services Tax (GST), the need to improve the quality of public expenditu re and the need to manage ecology, environment and changed climate consistent with sustainable development. The Commission shall review the state of the fi nances of the Union and the States, and suggest measures for maintaining a stab le and sustainable fiscal environment consistent with equitable growth.  The Commission may also review the present arrangements as regards financing of Disa ster Management with  reference to the National Calamity Contingency Fund and the Calamity Relief Fund and make appropriate recommendations thereon. The ThFC may also suggest a roadmap for 2010 to 2015 with a view to maintaining th e gains of fiscal consolidation after bringing the liabilities of the Central Government on the defic it targets.  It is expected that the ThFC, like its predecessors, would do ju stice to the issues related to vertical and horizontal equity even as taking the pr ocess of fiscal consolidation further.  State Finance Commission The Constitution (73rd and 74th) amendment Acts, 1993 have respectively, accorded constitutional status to rural and urban local bodies as  the third tier of Government. The Amendments provide for constitution of  State Finance Comm issions every five years. Following the recommendations of th e State Finance Commissions (SFCs) and taking into account the devolutions made by the Central Finance Commission (CFC), the State Governments are required to devolve resources to their local bodies.  Not all States have constituted SFCs.  and a fewer States have s ubmitted action taken reports (ATRs) on the recommendations made by the SFCs as noted by  the Twelfth (Central) Finance Commission (TwFC). The TwFC, inte r alia, recommended that SFCs should follow a normative approach in the assessmen t of revenues and expenditure in order to arrive at the gap that may be cons idered by the CFC and that the principal recommendations of the SFCs may be accepte d without modification as in the case  of CFC.   8  V. Role of the Reserve Bank of  India in Sub-National Finances  The RBI has, over the years, closely inte racted with the State Governments in its developmental role \u2013 particularly in area s of development of agriculture, and small industries. The RBI was specif ically entrusted with an important promotional role, since its inception, of financing agricultur al operations and marketing of crops. In fact, the Agricultural Credit Department was created simultaneously with the establishment of the RBI in 1935. Study of State Finances    The Reserve Bank prepares and publishes an annual Study on the State Government Finances. This is a unique st udy since it compiles, consolidates and analyses detailed data on the budgets of all the State Governments.  It also documents the policy initiatives on State finances  and debt management by the State Governments, the Government of India and the Reserve Bank. The study has been well received by policy makers and academicia ns, both in India and abroad, and is an important reference document.  Model Fiscal Responsibility Legislation The RBI played a facilitating role in the States\u2019 endeavour for rule-based fiscal reforms by providing the Secretariat support to a group of State Finance Secretaries for preparing a model fiscal responsibility legislation for the States. The final report was submitted to the Reserve Bank in January 2005. The Group recommended that the model legislation would generally follow the pattern of the Central FRBM Act, and build upon the State fiscal responsibility  legislations already enacted. The Group also took into account the inte rnational best practices availa ble in the area as well as the recommendations of the various committees on fiscal transparency and on the issues related to voluntary disclosure of information by the State Governments. Various dimensions of the fiscal legislativ e framework, such as, the choice of targets, the road map, independent evaluation criteri a, prioritisation of capital expenditure, treatment of contingent liabilities includi ng guarantees and computation of pension liabilities were deliberated upon to arrive at a consensus. State Finance Secretaries Conference   Clearly, the Reserve Bank has gone  beyond its statutorily mandated obligations and has provided the platform for interface between the RBI and the State Governments based on mutual trust on issues related to State finances where the other stakeholders \u2013 including repr esentatives from the Governme nt of India, Comptroller and Auditor General and the Planning Commissi on - are also invited to participate in the Conference. There are occasions when fi scal experts, leading commercial bankers and representatives of credit rating agenci es were also invited to participate and contribute to the specific issues on the agenda. Since 1997, 21 such conferences have been held and decisions have been arri ved at, in a consensual manner, on many  9critical issues such as revisions in lim its on Ways and Means advances and Overdraft Regulation Scheme, adoption of auction me thod for market borrowing, setting up of Consolidated Sinking Fund, ceiling on guara ntees and establishment of Guarantee Redemption Fund, disclosure and transpar ency in budget-making, and model fiscal responsibility legislatio n at the State level. Standing Technical Committee on States\u2019 Borrowings  The Bank\u2019s Annual Policy Statement for 2006-07 proposed to constitute a Standing Technical Committee (STC) under the aegis of the State Finance Secretaries Conference with representation from the Central and State Governments and the Reserve Bank to advise on the wide-rang ing issues relating to the borrowing programmes of Central and State Governme nts through a consensual and cooperative approach. The STC was, accordingly, constituted in December 2006 with the concurrence of the Government of India and in consultation with States. All States, the Central Government and the Reserv e Bank are members of the Committee.   VI. State Government Guarantees  and Fiscal Risk Management Against the imperative of infrastructural development on the one hand and resource constraint on the other, the States resorted to provision of guarantees mainly to third tier sub-national entities and State le vel public sector (but also private sector) bodies, to promote capital formation for economic development without regard to fiscal capacity for debt servicing in the event of devolvement of guarantees on State Governments.  The Reserve Bank has sensitized the Stat es about the fiscal risk associated with such guarantees, need for transparency  with regard to the guarantee policies and the magnitude of guarantees. The Reserve Bank provided the forum in the form of State Finance Secretaries Conference where the issues related to guarantees were discussed. Further, the Reserve Bank provi ded the technical e xpertise and provided the Secretariat to the various Groups on State Guarantees. Pursuant to the recommendations of a Technical Committee, several States have since fixed a ceiling on guarantees to be issued by them. Further,  a Group of State Finance Secretaries on the Fiscal Risk on State Government Guar antees (2002) underlined the importance of according appropriate risk weights in resp ect of devolvement of guarantees and suggested estimation of risk weighted guara ntees so as to make adequate budgetary provisions for honouring these guarantees onc e they devolve on the States. Since 2003, the Reserve Bank has been also or ganising workshops on the evaluation of fiscal risks of guarantees for the benefit of  State Government officials. The Report of the Fiscal Responsibility Le gislation at the State Leve l (2005) recommended fixing a limit on annual incremental risk-weighted gua rantees in relation to their GSDP/total revenue receipts. Many States have inco rporated this recommendation in their FRL although this was not mandated by the TwFC for receiving debt  relief.  Consequent to the improvement of the fiscal position of States, the record of honouring of guarantees by the State Governments ha s significantly improved.   Guarantee Redemption Fund The Reserve Bank, in its capacity as a regulator of banks and financial institutions, issued a circular in 2003 to the effect that they should exercise due diligence and proper appraisal to ensure project viability, irrespective of the provision of State Government guarantees. The Reserv e Bank also circulated a draft scheme on  10Guarantee Redemption Fund (GRF) amongst the State Governments for voluntary adoption. As on March 31, 2009 the aggreg ate investments of the nine State Governments that have set up the GRF amounted to Rs.30.4 billion. VII. Debt Management in an Era of Fiscal Consolidation  With the implementation of the TwFC\u2019s  recommendations, the year 2005-06 marked a watershed in the evolution of St ate finances and debt management. During 2005-06, 48.5 per cent of the market borrowings  were raised thr ough the auction route as compared with 2.3 per cent in 2004-05. The moderation in fiscal imbalances and enactment of fiscal responsibility legisla tion facilitated the smooth transition to the conduct of entire open market borrowings  by the auction route since 2006-07 as proposed by the Reserve Bank in its Annual Policy Statement 2006-07. This was notwithstanding the sharp increase in the ne t market borrowings from 0.3 per cent of GDP in 2006-07 to 1.9 per cent of GDP in 200 8-09. Reflecting the maturity profile of State Governments as also the timing of issuances, the weighted average cost of States\u2019 borrowings was marginally higher than  that of the cost of borrowings of the Centre. The spread over the Central Gove rnment Securities has declined from 34 basis points in 2004-05 to 16 basis points in 2008-09   (Table).  Table: Weighted Average Rate of  Coupon on Market Borrowings   Centre States Spread (bps) 2004-05 6.11 6.45 34 2005-06 7.34 7.63 29 2006-07 7.89 8.10 21 2007-08 8.12 8.25 13 2008-09 7.69 7.85 16  The interest rates on market borrowings  continued to rema in lower than 9.5 per cent charged for borrowings from the NSSF. The shift in borrowings from the NSSF and from the Centre to market borro wings has reduced th e weighted average cost of borrowings of State Government s and at the same time, improved their maneuverability on the desired quantum of borrowings. States\u2019 market borrowings have been by way of plain vanilla fixed coupon securities denominated in domestic currency which have several advantages. This has accorded certainty to the budgetary expenditu re and reduced balance sheet risks. The uncertainties in the cost of borrowings aris ing from the frequent resetting of interest rates that are associated with floating rate bonds are absent.  The maturity of State Government s ecurity is usually 10 years although securities of 11-13 years have also been  issued. The longish maturity of State Governments has protected the State Governme nt balance sheet from refinancing risk. Since the 10-year segment is the most li quid segment of the yield curve reflecting demand from most segments of the market, th e illiquidity premium is thus kept lower for the States.    Special Reserve Fund Under the Constitution, States cannot raise market borrowings from abroad. States are thus protected from exchange rate risk. States, however, are exposed to exchange rate risk consequent to th e acceptance of the TwFC recommendation relating to on-lending of external assistance loans to State Governments on a back-to-back basis. A few States had expressed di fficulties in making budgetary provisions in respect of external assistance loans if the ex change rates are volatile. In this context,  11the Technical Group on Borrowings by State Governments, which was set up under my chairmanship, felt that States coul d consider setting up sinking funds for managing exchange rate risks which could be funded by the savings resulting from payment of lower rate of interest on external borro wings in favourable times .  The modalities for setting up of the fund were s ubsequently discussed in the State Finance Secretaries Conference.   VIII. Ways and Means Advances to the State Governments    The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has b een extending Ways and Means Advances (WMA) to the State Governments since 1937, under the provisions of Section 17(5) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, with  the objective of covering temporary mismatches in  cash flows of their receipts and payments. According to the Act, such advances are repayable not later than thr ee months from the date of making that advance. The maximum amount of such adva nce by the RBI and th e interest charged thereon are, however, not specified in the RBI Act but are regulated by voluntary agreements with the State Governments. At  present, RBI is th e banker for 26 States (i.e. barring Jammu & Kashmir and Sikkim)  and the Union Territory of Puducherry.  There are two types of WMA viz., (i) Normal or clean advances, which were introduced in 1937; and (ii) Special or secured advances, in stituted in 1953, and which are provided against the collateral of  Government of India securities. State-wise limits in respect of Normal a nd Special WMA are fixed based on certain parameters; these limits have been revised periodically over the years. An overdraft (OD) occurs whenever these limits are exceeded.  Maximum time-period (days) and/or financial limits for which State Governments can remain in OD have been specified; these limits have also been revi sed periodically. Payments are suspended on behalf of the State Governments in  case OD limits are breached.     In view of the significant improvement in the cash position of th e State Governments, the normal WMA limits which were raised peri odically \u2013 usually on  an annual basis \u2013 have been retained at the level prev ailing since 2006-07. The WMA limits for 26 States and the Union Territory of  Puducherry stand at Rs.9,925 crore.   IX. Global Financial Crisis and the Way Forward  Fiscal Outturn The consolidated fiscal position of  the State Governments witnessed significant improvement in the recent years  reflecting the higher share in Central transfers as a follow-up of the recommendati ons of the TwFC, States\u2019 own efforts at revenue augmentation, rationalisation of reve nue expenditure and the cyclical upturn in the global economy that had a ripple eff ect on State finances. States recorded a revenue surplus of 0.6 per cent in 2006-07 for the first time since 1986-87. For the fiscal 2008-09, 25 States presented a reve nue surplus budget. Seventeen States budgeted their GFD at less than 3 per cent of GSDP.  The outstanding liabilities of States dec lined from the peak of 33.2 per cent in 2003-04 to 28.3 per cent in 2007-08  (RE) and were budgeted to decline further to 27.4 per cent in 2008-09 (BE). With the decline in the outstandi ng liabilities, the ratio of interest payments to revenue receipts was estimated to decline to 15.1 per cent in  122008-09 from a peak of 26.0 per cent in 2003 -04. The States have  thus achieved the targets of fiscal deficit and debt/GDP ratio  at the aggregate ahead of the schedule recommended by the 12th Finance Commission. Faced with  the global financial crisis, the States were thus on a relatively firm ground having left with some fiscal space and accordingly given additional allocation of ope n market borrowings equivalent to 0.5 percentage point of a State\u2019s GSDP as a pa rt of the second fiscal stimulus package over and above the mandate d 3.0 per cent during 2008-09.  Impact on States\u2019 Borrowings During 2008-09, the increase in net market borrowings of States has met with some investor fatigue reflecting the bunc hing of borrowings by States during the second half and the additional market bo rrowings by the Centre (Rs.1,16,000 crore or 2.1 per cent of GDP) over and above the budg eted amount. The spre ad increased to 102-236 basis points in auctions conducte d during January 13, 2009 to March 24, 2009 from 30-98 basis points during the fi rst half of 2008-09. Notwithstanding the increase in the spread, the cut-off yi elds ruled low at 6.65-8.89 per cent during January-March 2009 as compared with 8.39- 9.90 per cent during the first half of 2008-09 in view of the reduction of the moneta ry policy rates, decline in inflation and flight to safety by investors.   Impact on States\u2019 Receipts and Way Forward The spill-over impact of on-going global financial crisis on State finances can be gauged from the revised estimates (RE) of 2008-09 as availabl e in respect of 19 States in their budgets for 2009-10. A mode rate growth in revenue receipts outstripped by a higher growth in revenue expenditure resulted in moderation in revenue surplus. There has been a decline in States\u2019 own tax revenue and share in central taxes during 2008-09 (RE) over th e budget estimates (BE). Despite this, consolidated revenue receipts in the RE have shown some improvement over the BE mainly on account of increase in States\u2019 own non-tax revenues and grants from the Centre. During 2009-10 at the consolidated leve l, States are expect ing some recovery on account of States\u2019 own tax re venue as well as in share in central taxes. However, States\u2019 own non-tax revenue is budgeted to decline during 2009-10. As per the RE, aggregate expenditure of States for 2008-09 increased by 5.7 per cent over the BE largely on account of incr ease in capital outlay. However, during 2009-10, while revenue expenditure is budgete d to increase by 12 per cent, capital outlay is budgeted to decline by 6.6 per cent. As  a result, total expenditure of States is budgeted to increase by 9.6 per cent. Consolidated revenue surplus of 19 States as percentage of GDP has shown moderation in the RE of 2008-09, while it is budgeted to be wiped out and turn into deficit during 2009-10. The modera tion in revenue surplus c oupled with a decline in non-debt capital receipts and increase in cap ital outlay led to deterioration in gross fiscal deficit (GFD) in the re vised estimates of 2008-09. In f act, to address the issue of slowdown, Central Government allowed the St ates to increase the limit of fiscal deficit to 3.5 per cent dur ing 2008-09. Thus, States we re allowed to raise the additional market borrowing to the extent of 0.5 per cent of GS DP. This additional fiscal space was to be utilized for making cap ital investment. In addition, some States  13have also introduced stimulus packages  to boost investment particularly in infrastructure sectors. GFD as a percenta ge to GDP is budgeted to increase further during 2009-10.  We expect that once the global economy begins to recover, the sub-national governments would re-affirm their commitment  to the fiscal responsibility and be back onto the path of fiscal consolid ation. Meanwhile, the challenge for the governments and the RBI is to manage the tr ansition with as little pain as possible.

The global economy is passing through its deepest financial a nd economic crisis of our time. Protecting the Indian economy from th e worst impact of the crisis has been a big challenge for the gove rnment and the Reserve Bank. Equally, I am conscious of the fact that industry, business and investors gathered here today ha ve had to make very challenging adjustments in these difficult times.   2. The Chinese have a saying, \u201cm ay you live in interesting times.\u201d I can hardly complain. These have be en very interesting times for me, perhaps a bit too interesting. I came into the Reserve Bank when runaway inflation around the world,  and here in India, was the overriding concern. Less than a mont h later, this turned into the                                                  1 Speech delivered by Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Financial Management Summit 2009 organized by the Economic Times on May 22, 2009 in Mumbai.  2biggest global recession of our times with severe financial dislocation and concerns about deflation becoming the global chorus.    Crisis management around the world 3. During this period, macroec onomic management, needless to say, has been challenging. The fina ncial crisis called into question several fundamental assumptions  and beliefs about economic resilience and financial stability. With  all the advanced economies in a synchronised recession, global GDP is  projected to contract for the first time since the Second World War.  We were lulled into believing that the rewards of the Great Mode ration were with us for ever to enjoy until the Great Unravelling hit us  and forced us into this Great Recession.   4. Governments and central banks around the world have responded to the crisis in an unpr ecedented show of policy force. The shock and awe of fiscal stimulus a nd monetary easing is still with us. Importantly, given the nature of th e crisis, purely national responses have been supplemented by global e fforts.  The G-20 group of nations met twice in the last six months.   At their April 2009 meeting, the G-20 leaders collectively committed to  take decisive, coordinated and  3comprehensive actions to revive growth, restore stability of the financial system, restart the impa ired credit markets and rebuild confidence in financial ma rkets and institutions.    5. The crisis has forced macroeconomic policy around the world into clearly uncharted territory. G overnments and central banks took largely unprecedented fiscal and mone tary policy measures to prevent the global recession from turning into a protracted depression.   6. Some analysts said this was an over reaction. Others criticized the tyranny of the short term compromising medium term sustainability. But received wisdom and mainstream view have been that it was clearly safer to err on doing too much rather than doing too little. Thus the policy response should be  seen as an in surance against this risk. But there is no real way of judging whether we are overinsuring or underinsuring. If indeed the world has overinsured, then there is a risk that all this li quidity has the pote ntial to trigger a bout of undesirable infl ation. Conversely, if we have underinsured, then this recession could turn deeper , nastier, and longer. And as we know from experience, there is no way to measure apriori  whether we have insured right. So policymaker s all over the world are perhaps  4erring on the side of overinsuring - keeping financial markets flush with liquidity, providing substantial fiscal support, using the breathing space provided by the policy support to restructure the financial system, and hoping that they can w ithdraw the liquidity and stimulus as the recovery firms up and before inflationary threats take root.     7. Notwithstanding the relative calm  in recent weeks, the global financial outlook continues to be uncer tain. It is not clear that we have seen the end of the emergence of ta inted assets, and doubts persist on whether the initiatives underway are sufficient to restore the stability of the financial system.  There is continued debate on the adequacy of the fiscal stimulus packages across countries, and th eir effectiveness in arresting the downturn, reversin g job losses and reviving consumer confidence.  Many major central banks have nearly or totally exhausted their conven tional weaponry of calib rating policy interest rates and are now resorting to unc onventional measures such as quantitative and credit easing.  Given the erosion of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, there are concerns about when and to what extent monetary response, ad mittedly aggressive, will begin to have an impact on reviving cred it flows and spurring aggregate demand.     5 India - crisis response and challenge 8. At home, the impact of the crisis has been deeper than anticipated earlier although less seve re than in other emerging market economies.  The extent of impact  has caused dismay, mainly on two grounds: first, because our financia l sector remains healthy, has had no direct exposure to tainted assets  and its off-balance sheet activities have been limited; and second, because India\u2019s merchandise exports, at less than 15 per cent of GDP, ar e relatively modest.  Despite these mitigating factors, the crisis hit I ndia underscoring the rising two-way trade in goods and services and fina ncial integration with the rest of the world.    9. There have been several comforting factors going into the slowdown. First, our fina ncial markets, particul arly our banks, have continued to function normally.  S econd, India\u2019s comfortable foreign exchange reserves provide confiden ce in our ability to manage our balance of payments notwithst anding lower export demand and dampened capital flows.  Third, headline inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), has d eclined sharply. Consumer price inflation too has begun to moderate .  Fourth, because of mandated  6agricultural lending and social sa fety-net programmes, rural demand continues to be robust.    10. Both the Government and th e Reserve Bank responded to the challenge strongly, and in close coordination and consultation. The Reserve Bank shifted its policy st ance from monetary tightening in response to the elevated inflationary pressures in the first half of 2008-09 to monetary easing in re sponse to easing inflationary pressures and moderation of growth  engendered by the crisis.  The Reserve Bank\u2019s policy response was aimed at containing the contagion from the global financ ial crisis while maintaining comfortable domestic and foreign exchange liquidity. Taking a cue from the Reserve Bank\u2019s monetary eas ing, most banks have reduced their deposit and lending rates.    11. The Government launched thr ee fiscal stimulus packages between December 2008 a nd February 2009. Thes e stimulus packages came on top of an already announced  expanded safety-net programme for the rural poor, the farm loan wa iver package and payout following the Sixth Pay Commission report, all of which too added to stimulating demand.  7  12. As the monetary and fiscal st imuli work their way through, and if calm and confidence ar e restored in the global markets, we can see economic turn around later this y ear. After averaging nine per cent growth over the last four years, ec onomic activity in India has slowed since the last quarter of 2008.  Th e outcomes in recent months have been mixed. While overall industria l production fell again in March, cement and steel production have s hown some preliminary signs of upturn. Segments in the automobile sector, particularly two and three wheelers and passenger cars, are s howing modest revival of demand. The industrial and business outlook is improving. These signs are not unambiguous  \u2014 there is as yet no clear sign of export decline reversing the trend, and credit growth  continues to be subdued. Taking the evolving global situation and th e domestic conditions into account, in our Annual Policy Statement last month, we  projected real GDP growth of 6.0 per cent for 2009/10 . The balance of our assessment continues to support this growth projection.   13. While the risks from the uncer tainties in the global financial markets continue to persist, there are risks on the domestic front too. The challenge is how we manage  the recovery. The fiscal and  8monetary response now on  will have to weigh in the state of the economy going forward 6-9 months. If the global recovery takes root and private investment demand revive s faster, there could be less of a case for further stimulus. On the other hand, if global financial markets do not stabilize and global recovery does not take hold by the last quarter of 2009, we would rea lize with the benefit of hindsight, that the domestic policy response  should have been stronger.    14. So, where and how does the economic dilemma fit into the topic of risk management, which is th e subject of this summit? It fits in because the context throws up qu estions about risk management in the macroeconomy.  How does one he dge against the uncertainty of outcomes of toady\u2019s fiscal and monetary policy actions? How does one insure against such risks? Clearly there are no easy ways; if indeed there were, we would not be having this seminar. I will focus on three aspects: monetary policy, fi scal policy, and financial stability to define the contours of uncertainty.   Looking ahead - monetary policy   15. On the monetary policy front , managing the risk calls for maintaining ample liquidity in the system. The RBI has done so the  9past six months through a variety of instruments and facilities.  And in the April 2009 policy review, we ex tended the tenure many of these facilities. Some will argue, and right ly so, that this might be sowing the seeds of the next inflationary cy cle. And this is exactly the kind of risk one has to grapple with. So while the Reserve Bank will continue to support liquidity in the economy,  it will have to ensure that as economic growth gathers momentum , the excess liquidity is rolled back in an orderly manner.  It is important to note though that even as the monetary easing has increased liquidity considerably, at the aggregate level this has not been  out of line with our monetary aggregates unlike in many advanced countries. As such, the challenge of unwinding will be less daunting for India than for other countries.   16. The rise in macroeconomic uncertainty and the financial dislocation of last year  have raised a related problem. The adjustment in market interest rates in respons e to changes in policy rates gets reflected with some lag. In Indi a monetary transmission has had a differential impact across different segments of the financial market. While the transmission has been faster in the money and bond markets, it has been relatively mu ted in the credit market on account of several structural rigidities. However, the earlier acceleration in  10inflation coupled with high credit demand appears to have added to these rigidities by prompting banks to  raise deposits at higher rates to ensure longer term access to liquidi ty. High deposit rates in turn have not allowed banks to cut lending rates at a faster  pace consistent with the growth and inflation outlook. Although deposit rates are declining and effective lending rates are falli ng, there is clearly more space to cut rates given declinin g inflation. Making liquidity available in sufficient quantity, as RBI has done , should also help by giving confidence to banks of the availability of funds .   Looking ahead - fiscal policy   17. The challenge for fiscal polic y is to balance immediate support for the economy with the need to get back on track on the medium-term fiscal consolidation process.  The fiscal stimul us packages and other measures have led to sharp increase in the revenue and fiscal deficits which, in the face of slowing private investment, have cushioned the pace of economic activity.      18. The first order of economic business for the new government will be the full budget. Given the s till soft economy, the pressure to provide more stimulus will persist. While this may help in the very  11near term, the sustainability of th e recovery requires returning to responsible fiscal consolidation.  The borrowing programme of the government has already expanded rapidly. The Reserve Bank has been able to manage the large borrowing programme in an orderly manner.  Large borrowings by th e government run against the low interest rate environment that the Reserve Bank is trying to maintain to spur investment demand in keep ing with the stance of monetary policy.   19. The Reserve Bank will continue to use a combination of monetary and debt ma nagement tools to manage the government borrowing programme to ensure its successful completion in a smooth manner. During the first half of  2009-10, planned Open Market Operations (OMO) purchases and Ma rket Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) unwinding will add primary liquidity  which will be equivalent, in terms of monetary impact, to re duction of CRR by three percentage points. This should leave adequate  resources with banks to expand credit. However, with every percen tage point increase in the fiscal deficit, maintaining adequate liqui dity in the system becomes that much more difficult. Managing this trade off between our short term  12compulsions and longer term sustai nability will be one of the big challenges going forward.   Looking ahead - financial stability   20. Beyond monetary and fiscal policies, preserving financial stability is key to navigating th ese uncertain times.  A sound and resilient banking sector, well-functio ning financial markets, robust liquidity management and payment and settlement infrastructure are the pre-requisites for financial stab ility.   The banking sector in India is sound, adequately capitalized a nd well-regulated.  By all counts, Indian financial markets are capable of withstanding the global shock, perhaps somewhat bruised but definitely not battered.     21. But how sure can we be?  He re we have some encouraging news. Amidst the din of the financ ial turmoil and the all-consuming fixation on rate cuts over the last six months, a seminal report on the health of the Indian financial syst em has received less notice than it deserved.   Committee on Financial S ector Assessment (CFSA)   22. In March this year, the Gove rnment and RBI jointly released the report of the Committee on Fina ncial Sector Assessment (CFSA)  13that was co-chaired by Deputy G overnor Rakesh Mohan and Finance Secretary Ashok Chawla. The report is the culmination of work started in September 2006 to u ndertake a comprehensive self-assessment of India\u2019s financial s ector, particularly focusing on  stability assessment and stress te sting and compliance with all financial standard s and codes.    23. The CFSA owes its origins to the Financial Sector Assessment Program, FSAP for short, that was initiated in 1999 and carried out jointly by the IMF and the World Ba nk after the Asian crisis. Several countries, including India, participated in this long drawn and resource intensive exercise. This program so far has been conducted by the IMF and the World Bank us ing experts from around the world to carry out the assessment with pa rticipation from the host country.    24. While India had earlier partic ipated in the FSAP conducted by the IMF and World Bank, to the be st of my knowledge, we are first country to make a self assessment of its financ ial sector in line with the FSAP. This is a remarkable achievement especially as the assessment conformed to the structure and procedure laid down by the IMF, the World Bank and several sta ndard-setting bodies like the BIS,  14IOSCO and IAIS. As the previous Finance Secretary, I had watched the process first hand. By all acc ounts, this was a large and complex exercise. But the Government and the RBI remained committed to a rigorous, transparent and unbiased process.    25. The CFSA followed a forward-looking and holistic approach to self-assessment, based on three mutua lly reinforcing pillars: financial stability assessment and stress testin g; legal, infrastructural and market development issues; and an  assessment of the status of implementation of international fi nancial standards and codes. The first pillar is essentially concerne d with stability assessment. Taking into account the legal, regulatory and supervisory architecture in India, the CFSA felt the need for involving, and associating closely, all the major regulatory institutions in the financial sector \u2014 the RBI, SEBI and IRDA,  besides the rele vant government departments. Direct official involvement at different levels brought about enormous responsibility, ownership, and commi tment to the process, ensuring constructive pragmatism when fa ced with contentious issues.   26. Since the assessment re quired comprehensive domain knowledge in the various technical areas examined, the CFSA initially  15constituted Technical Groups compri sing officials with first-hand experience in handling the resp ective areas from the regulatory agencies concerned as well as the government to undertake the preliminary assessment and to prep are technical notes and background material in the concerned areas. This ensured that officials who are well-conversant with their own systems and are aware of the existing strengths and weaknesses could identif y the best alternative solutions.   27. To ensure an impartial asse ssment, the CFSA constituted four external independent Advisory Panels, comprising non-official experts drawn from within the c ountry. These Panels made their assessments after thorough debate  and rigorous scrutiny of inputs provided by the Technical Groups. To further strengthen the credibility of this assessment, the Advisory Panels\u2019 assessments were peer reviewed by eminent international experts.   28. The CFSA then drew up its own overview report at the final stage, drawing upon the assessmen ts, findings and recommendations of the Advisory Panels and the co mments of the peer reviewers. The assessments and recommendations comp rise six volumes. All the six volumes are freely available on RBI\u2019s  website and I would strongly  16recommend that you read them. If si x volumes are daunting, then read at least the first two volumes, vi z., the Executive Summary and the Overview Report.   29. Overall, the CFSA found that ou r financial system is essentially sound and resilient, and that systemic  stability is by and large robust. India is broadly compliant with most of the standards and codes though gaps were noted in the tim ely implementation of bankruptcy proceedings.    30. Of immediate interest, and related closely to the current macroeconomic conditions, the CFSA also carried out single-factor stress-tests for credit and market risk s and liquidity ratio and scenario analyses. These tests show that there are no significant vulnerabilities in the banking system. This does not mean that NPAs will not rise in this economic slowdown. NPAs may indeed rise, as the Reserve Bank has pointed out. But given the stre ngth of the banks\u2019 balance sheets, that rise is not likely to pose any sy stemic risks, as it might in many advanced countries.   31. Risk assessment, however, is  a continuous process and the stress tests need to be c onducted taking into account the  17macroeconomic linkages as also the second round and contagion risks. The Reserve Bank intends to formaliz e this process by setting up an inter-disciplinary Financial Stab ility Unit to monitor and address systemic vulnerabilities.   India Outlook   32. Le t me now conclude . We are, as I said at the beginning, in uncharted policy territory. The crisis  is forcing countries around the world to test the limits of their fiscal  and monetary tools. This is true for macroeconomic policy, and I belie ve it is also true for business policy, which you will be discu ssing today. Our economy remains fundamentally strong despite the adverse impact of the global financial crisis. With the right mix of macroeconomic policy and corporate strategy, my sense is th at, as an economy, we will emerge from this global recession stronger than before.   33. Once again thank you for this opportunity to share my views. I wish your deliberations all success.  ", "26 Oct 18 MP.pdf": "1  On t he Importance of Independent Regulatory Institutions \u2013 The Case of the Central Bank  By Dr. Viral V Acharya, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India1 Delivered as the A . D. Shroff Memorial Lecture in Mumbai on Friday, October 26, 2018  No analogy is perfect; y et, analogies  help convey things  better . At times, a straw  man has to be set up to make succinctly a practical or even an academic point.  Occasionally,  however, real life examples come along beautifully to make a communicator\u2019s work easier.  L et me start today with an antecedent  from 2010 as it is particularly apposite  for the theme of my talk : \u201cMy time at the central bank is up and that is why I have decided to leave my post definitively, with the satisfaction of my duty fulfilled,\u201d Mr Martin Redrado, Argentina\u2019s central bank chief, told a news conference late on Friday, January 29, 2010. \u201cWe have arrived at this situation because of the national government\u2019s permanent trampling of institutions,\u201d he said .  \u201cBasically, I am defending two main concepts: the independence of the central bank in our decision- making process and that the reserves should be used for monetary and financial stability.\u201d  The roots of this  dramatic  exit lay in an emergency decree passed by the Argentine government led by C ristina Fernand\u00e9 z on December 14, 2009 , that would set up a Bicentennial Stability and Reduced Indebtedness Fund to finance publ ic debt maturing that year. This  involved the transfer of $6.6 billion of the central bank reserves to the national treasury. The claim was that the central bank had $18 billion in \u201cexcess reserves.\u201d [In fact, Mr. Redrado had refused to transfer the funds ; so the government attempted to fire him , by another emergency decree on January 7, 2010 for misconduct and derel iction of duty;  this attempt, however, failed, as  it was unconstitutional.]  Besides sparking off one of the worst constitution al crises in Argentina since its  economic meltdown in 2001, the chain of events  led to a grave reassessment of its  sovereign risk.   Within a month of Mr. Redrado\u2019s resignation, Argentine sovereign bond yields and the annual premium cost for buying insurance against loss from default on Argentine government bonds (measured as the sovereign credit default swap spread) shot up by about 2.5% or 250 basis points, by more than a fourth of their prior levels.                                                              1 I am grateful to Governor Dr. Urjit R Patel , Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for his suggestion to explore  this theme  for a speech , for referring me to the work of  the L ate Deena Khatkhate (2005),  and for his constant encouragement, feedback and guidance. I am also indebted to  insightful exchanges with  Professor Rak esh Mohan  of Yale University  and former Deputy Governor of the RBI ; Dr. Nachiket Mor of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, during his term as a Central Board M ember of the RBI ; my fellow  Deputy Governor, N. S. Vishwanathan; my colleague, Dr . Michael D . Patra, Executive Director and Monetary Po licy Committee member;  as well as Jose Ka ttoor, Mridul Saggar  and Vineet Srivastava of the RBI . All errors that remain are my own.  2  Alberto Ramos, Argentina analyst at Goldman Sachs, noted on February 7, 2010: \u201c Using central bank reserves to pay government obligations is not a positive development and the concept of excess reserves is certainly open to debate. It weakens the balance sheet of the central bank and provides the wrong incentive to the government, as it weakens the incentive to control the rapid expansion of spending and to promote some consolidation of fis cal accounts in 2010.\u201d  Even more damagingly, a risk that Governor Redrado had warned about came to the fore. By beginning of January, 2010, Thomas Griesa, a New York judge, had frozen the Argentine central bank\u2019s account held at the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York, following claims of investors that the central bank was no longer an autonomous agency but under the thumb of the country\u2019s executive branch.  (The above summary is based in part on Argentina\u2019s central bank chief resigns , Jude Webber, Financial Times, January 30, 2010; and Argen tina: Bank independence at stake as Redrado exits , Jason Mitchell, Euromoney, February 7, 2010)   This complex interplay of the sovereign\u2019s exercise of its power s, the central banker\u2019s exit, and the market\u2019s revolt, will be at the center of my remarks today on why it is important for a well -functioning economy to have an independent central bank, i.e., a central bank that is independent from the executive branch of the governm ent.  I will also try to lay out  why the risks of undermining the central bank\u2019s  independence are potentially cat astrophic, a \u201cself -goal\u201d of sorts, as it can trigger a crisis of confidence in capital markets that are tapped by government s (and others in the economy) to run thei r finances.   Why Nations Succeed (or Fail ) Before I d elve into this complex interplay, I wish to place the independence of the central bank in a more general context .  Academic discourse by political economi sts recognises the key role played by the rule of  law and accountability of government s in enabling countries to flourish.  Francis Fukuyama ( The Origins of Political Order , 2011) considers these two elem ents, along with adequate state - and institution -building, as all being critical for \u201cgetting to Denm ark,\u201d or in other words, creating stable, peaceful, prosperous, inclusive and honest societies.  Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson ( Why Nations Fail, 2012) summarize their body of work on the primacy of the quality of institutions in explaining the politic al and economic success or failure of states.  Taking examples of \u201ctwin\u201d country case studies (such as S. Korea and N. Korea), the book elaborates  the following important distinction:  - Inclusive economic and political institutions  involve plura lity in decision -making which help guarantee the rule of law and foster talent and creativity ; in the presence of such institutions , economics and politics do not  become hostage to a set of incumbents likely to be hurt by change.  3  - In contrast , extractive institutions limit access to a country\u2019s economic and financial resources to the ruling elites, hinder change and innovation, and over time, lead to stagnation and atrophy of the country \u2019s potential.  In conversations with former colleagues at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Busi ness (NYU Stern) , it was routine to categorise  economies as encouraging and supporting either value creation, whereby entrepreneurs believed their mantra of success lay in challenging orthodoxy, or rent extraction, wherein businesses fo und value primarily from joining hands with regressive state policies and crowding out others who had no such access. Regardless of the preferred theory and terminology for the importance of institutions, it is well accepted that they include , inter alia , property rights and their enforcement, the judicia ry, and the election office in a democracy , instituted not just de jure but allowed to operate independently and function effectively de facto.  Somewhat less celebrated is the institution of an independent central bank, perhaps not just because the central bank is a relatively new kid on the block  (in most cases less than a century old), but also because it interacts less directly with the public  though its true influence is far -reaching.  Government and the Central Bank \u2013 A Tale of Two Horizons   A central bank performs several important functions for the economy: it controls the money supply; sets the rate of interest on borrowing and lending money; manages the external sector including the exchange rate; supervises and regulates the financial sector, notably banks; it often regulates cred it and foreign exchange markets ; and, seeks to ensure  financial stability , domestic as well as on the external f ront. The world over, the central bank is set up as an  institution separate from the government; put another way, it is not a department of the executive function of the government ; its powers are enshrined as being separate through relevant legislation . Its tasks being somewhat complex and techni cal, central banks are ideally headed and manned by technocrats or field experts  \u2013 typically economists, academics, commercial bankers, and occasionally private sector representatives, appointed by the government but not elected to the office. This architecture reflects the acceptance of the thesis that central banks should be allowed to exercise their powers independently. Why is the central bank separate  from the government ? I will offer what I find to be a particularly intu itive explanation:  (1) The first part of the explanation relates to the horizon of decision- making of a government vis-\u00e0-vis that of the central bank.   A government\u2019s horizon of decision- making is rendered short , like the duration of a T20 match (to use a cricketing analogy ), by several considerations. There are always upcoming elections of some sort \u2013 national, state, mid- term, etc.  As elections approach, delivering on proclaimed manifestos of the past acquires urgency; where manifestos cannot be delivered  4  upon, populist alternatives need to be arranged with immediacy. Less important in the present scenario, but only recently  so, wars had to be waged, financed and won at all costs. This myopia or short -termism of governments is best summarized in h istory by Louis XV when he proclaimed \u201cApres moi, le deluge!\u201d  (After me, the flood!).2  In contrast, a central bank plays  a Test match, trying to win each session but importantly also  survive it so as to have a chance to win the next session, and so on. In particular,  the central bank is not directly subject to political  time pressures and the induced neglect of the future; by virtue of being nominated rather than elected , central bankers have horizons of decision-making that tend to be longer than that of go vernments, spanning election cycles or war periods . While they clearly have to factor in the immediate consequences of their policy decisions, central bankers can afford to take a pause, reflect, and ask the question as to what would be the long- term con sequences of their , as well as government\u2019s,  policies. Indeed, by their mandate central banks are committed  to stabilise the economy over business and financial cycles, and hence, have to peer into the medium to long term.  Unsurprisingly, central ban ks st rive to build credibility through a series of difficult choices that reflect sacrificing short -term gains for long- term outcomes such as price or financial stability .  (2) The second part of the explanation as to why the central bank is separate from the government relates to the observation that much of what the central bank manages  or influences  \u2013 money creation, credit creation, external sector management , and financial stability  \u2013 involves potential front -loaded benefits to the economy but with the possibility of attendant \u201ctail risk \u201d in the form of back- loaded costs from financial  excess or instability . For example,   (i) Greater supply of money can facilitate ease of financial transactions, including  the financing of government deficits, but this can cause economy to over -heat in due course and trigger (hyper -) inflationary pressures  or even a full -blown crisis  that eventually require sharper monetary contractions ;   (ii) Excessive lowering of interest rates and/or relaxation in  bank capital and liquidity requirements can lead to greater credit creation , asset -price inflation,  and semblance of strong economic growth in the short  term, but excessive credit growth is usually accompanied by lendin g down the quality c urve which trigger s mal-investment , asset -price crashes,  and fina ncial crises in the long  term;   (iii) Allowing foreign capital flows to flood into the economy can temporarily ease the financing pressures for  an expanding government balance -sheet and the crowd ed-out                                                             2 See Acharya and Rajan (2013)  for a complete theoretical analysis modeling government myopia  and populism (maximising simply the cash- flow and spending each per iod) in the presence of a sovereign debt market;  implications for policies  governing the financial sector;  and attendant risks in the form of economic repression and financial crises.  5  private sector, but a  \u201csudden stop\u201d or exodus of these flows in future can trigger a collapse of the exchange rate with adverse economy- wide spillovers; and,   (iv) Sweeping bank loan losses under the rug by compromising supervis ory and regulatory standards can create a fa\u00e7ade of financial stability in the short ru n, but inevitably cause the fragile deck of cards to fall in a heap  at some point in future, likely with a greater taxpayer bill and loss of potential output .   While not a lways the case, often the requi red interventions for stable growth are structural reforms  by the government  with upfront fiscal outlay ; however, these may compromise populist expenditures or require displeasing incumbents.  As a result, it might seem as an  expedient solution to the government to  ask/task/mandate/direct  the central bank  to pursue strategies that generate short -term gains but effectively create tail risk s for the economy.  To protect the economy from such short -termism , the central bank is designed to be at a safe distance from the executive branch of the government.  Undermining the Independence of the Central Bank  Now, although the central bank is formally organised  to be separate from the government, its effective horizon of decision- making can be reduced for short -term gains by the government , if it so desires,  through a variety of mechanisms, inter alia ,  (i) Appointing government (or government -affiliated) officials rather than technocrats to key central bank positions, such as Governor , and more generally, seni or management ;   (ii) Pursuing steady attrition and erosion of statutory powers of the central bank through piece -meal legislative amendments that directly or indirectly eat at separation of the central bank from the government ;   (iii) Blocking or opposing rule -based central banking policies, and favoring instead discretionary or joint decision -making with direct government interventions; and,   (iv) Setting up parallel regulatory agencies with weaker statutory powers and/ or encouraging development of unregulated (or lightly regulated) entities that perform financial intermediation functions outside the purview of the c entral bank.3,4                                                               3 The most striking example is the presence of government- sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to support mortgages and home ownership in the United States. The GSEs are outside of any regulatory purview of the Federal Reserve, but have been deployed by successive g overnments to pursue populist housing policies, contributing significantly to the imbalances that led to the Global Financial Crisis of 2007 -08 and the ensuing Great Recession (see, Acharya, van Nieuwerburgh, Richardson and White, 2011, for details ).  4 See Acharya (2015)  for discussion on the resulting need to ensure that the central bank has regulatory scope over parts of \u201cshadow banking\u201d that are likely to be systemically important.  6  If such efforts are successful, they induce policy myopia in the economy that substitutes macroeconomic stability with punctuated arrival of financial crises.  There fore, there  are several reasons why enshrining and maintaining central bank independence ends up being an inclusive reform for the economy; and conversely, undermining such independence a regressive, extractive one:  (i) When t he government is seen often making efforts to dilute the central bank\u2019s polici es and effectively coercing the central bank into such dilutions , banks and private sector spend more time lobbying for policies that suit them individually, at the cost of collective good, rather than investing in value creation and growth.   (ii) When governance of the central bank is undermined, it is unlikely to attract or be able to retain the brightest minds that thrive on the ability to debate freely, think independently, and e ffect change; attrition of central bank powers results in attrition of its human capital and deterioration of its efficiency and expertise over time.   (iii) When important parts of financial intermediation are kept outside the purview of the central bank, systemic risks can build up in \u201cshadow banking\u201d with private gains in good times to a small set of players but at  substantive costs to future generations in the form of unchecked financial fragility .  As such, the divergence in horizon of decision -making between government and the central bank that I have highlighted need not lead to any operational incompatibility a s long as it is well -understood and well -accepted by both parties that it is precisely given this divergence that the central bank is formally separated from the executive office and meant to conduct its functions in an independent manner. The central bank can of course make mistakes,  and is generally held publicly accountable through parliamentary scrutiny and transparency norms. This way, the institutional arrangement of independence, transparency and accountability to the public not only balance but also  strengt hen the central bank\u2019s autonomy.  However, direct intervention and interference by the government in operational mandate of the central bank negate it s functional autonomy.   \u201cKiss of Death\u201d \u2013 Incurring the Wrath of Markets  Far-sighted government leaders may be able to reap benefits o f convincing voters about the importance of investing  in macro -economic stability; for instance, by claim ing credit for the long- term nature of financia l sector outcomes attained by allowing the central bank autonomy in decision- making and delivery of its core  functions. When such a measured  perspective of an independent central bank as a key element of durable economic prosperity is missing  and/or government myopia so rife as to lead to regular inroads into central ba nking apparatus and decisions , unfortunate accidents can arise. Macroeconomic management can become  a tug of war  between securing stability and inflicting misdirection; daily operational decisions lead to power struggles; and, as the central bank is forced to bend over backwards to retain credibility in the 7  face of imminent pressures that would erode it s independence , counter efforts to reduce its independence  escalate.   As this dynamic  plays out, markets wat ch keenly , and if uncertainty grows and con fidence in central bank independence and credibility erode, then markets rap bond yields and exchange rate  on the knuckles !   Let me elaborate.  Modern economies are, by and large , not autarkies; they rely on capital markets to finance their investments. This is especially true of governments as reflected in the relatively large size of sovereign (and quasi -sovereign) debt markets, denominated in domestic currency as well as foreign currency. As long- term risks such as inflation or financial in stability rise, markets reprice  sovereign debt  and may potentially shun its financing altogether . This could have immediate spillovers to other markets such as for foreign exchange and foreign investments, potenti ally putting at risk also the external sector stability of the economy.  Therefore, the  presence of this third player \u2013 the market \u2013 in the back and forth between a government and the central bank (more generally, regulatory institutions) is an important feedback mechanism.  The market  can discipline the government not to erode central bank independence, and it can  also make the government pay for its transgressions . Interestingly, the market also forces central banks to remain a ccountable and independent wh en it is under government pressure .5 Besides the market revolt and strictures during the Argentine episode of 2010 that I recounted in my introductory remarks, it is to be noted that both of this year\u2019s emerging market sovereign bond and currency meltdowns got  catalysed through a perception of government influence on central bank\u2019s monetary policy, including through sporadic communication by government with public  on its desire to control the  central bank\u2019s decision -making. I n one case, a rate cut in the wake of rising inflation and mounting fiscal deficit  did the damage ; and in the other, it was a public pronouncement by the  premier of the state about the \u201cevils \u201d of interest rate hikes even when inflation was  in double digit terrain.  Indeed, the market censure need not be limited to emerging markets.  The public expression of government \u2019s bewilderment and disappointment at monetary tightening in the world\u2019s largest safe- haven e conomy, again  at a time of rising inflation and fiscal deficit,  has raised in minds of investors  scenarios under which its  reserve currency status can not anymore be taken for granted (A debate about central -bank independence is overdue, The Economist, Oct 20, 2018) .   Barry Eichengreen, P rofessor of Economics and Political Science at  the University of California, Berkeley, covers superbly, in his recent piece (2018), this critical feedback role of the market :                                                             5 An interesting suggestion from Michael Patra is that perhaps economies should not only have rules that delineate clearly the roles of the government and the central bank, but also a dispute resolution mechanism a la the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The very presence of a referee would recognise that differences in objectives and horizons of decision- making arise; central bank and government can (to borrow his exact words) \u201cgo in there, slug it out, come out battered, but in understanding, since there has to be a clear winner whose hand will be upheld by the jury.\u201d 8  \u201cThere are good reasons why countries \u2026 delegate monetary policy decisions to technocrats appointed for their expertise.  They can take the long view.  They can resist the temptation to manipulate monetary conditions f or short -term gain.  Privileging long -term stability, as history has shown, is positive for economic performance.  And it is on this performance that elected leaders, rightly or wrongly, are judged. Thoughtful politicians understand this. Hence their support for central bank independence and their respect for the convention that they should refrain from seeking to influence central bank decisions.  Unfortunately, not all politicians are thoughtful.  Not all have the patience to wait for long- term gains.  Not all are pleased when appointees refuse to bow to their wishes.  And not all are respectful of inherited institutions and conventions, be they central bank independence or, more broadly, the division of powers.  The question is whether they pay attention t o markets.\u201d  What Barry Eichengreen is perceptively observ ing is that if a government  were to pay attention to markets, it  would realize that  central bank independe nce is in fact  its strength and the central bank a sort of a true friend, someone who will tell the government unpleasant but brutally honest truths  and correct to the extent it can any  adverse long -term consequences of government  policies .  Let me now turn to how all this relates to the Reserve Bank of India.   The Late Deena Khatkhate provides a masterful and scholarly assessment in Reserve Bank of India: A Study in the Separation and Attrition of Powers (2005). Some of the discussion below draws heavily from his assessment and is updated for developments  since then.  Other excellent discussions  of the central bank\u2019s autonomy and independence  in the Indian context  are contained in lectures by the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s former Governors, Dr. C. Rangarajan (1993) a nd Dr. Y. V. Reddy (2001, 2007).  As we will see below, other Governors and Deputy G overnors have also carried this abidi ng theme through their tenures.  For some of them, even when the Reserve Bank\u2019s independence has been unclear de jure , governments have in the end have had the wisdom to support  it de facto; for others, however, the Reserve Bank\u2019s independence has remained  a work in progress, a n enduring challenge that the nation has been grappling with on an ongoing basis .  Progressive E volution in Restoring Independence of the Reserve Bank of India  While the Reserve Bank has always der ived several important powers from the Reserve Bank Act, 1935 and the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, what matters is the effective independence with which these powers can be exercised in practice.  Over time, great strides have been undertaken by successiv e governments at the behest of the central bank, several economists, and umpteen committee reports, to restore the operational independence of the Reserve Bank. I will touch upon three such areas of healthy progress . 9  (1) Monetary Policy:  The Reserve Bank , like many central banks of the time , got quickly trapped into the socialist planning policies of  post-independence government, setting not just the rate o f interest on money but practically all rates of credit at different maturities , as well as doing sectoral credit allocatio n to the real economy.    Post the deregulation of interest rates in the 1990 s, monetary policy achieved a more modern dimension.  To start with, there was  a \u201cmultiple indicators\u201d approach to setting interest rates . Having too many objectives for monetary policy  violate s the Tinbergen principle of \u201con e objective, one instrument\u201d ; it also render s it difficult to understand or communicate what the interest -rate setting  is attempting to achieve at any point of time . Importantly, this  approach entertain ed much  regulatory  discretion , often  at the level of an individual, viz. the Reserve Bank Governor.  This made independence of monetary policy individual -specific; in other words, it allowed  for government pressure  to creep in easily for keep ing rates low at times of fiscal expansion  under one guise or the other .   This is exactly a setting where rules woul d be better than discretion, in particular to avoid the time -inconsistency problem, highlighted in the work of Nobel laureates Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott in 1970s and early 1980s.  Kydland and Prescott (1977) consider  the implication that people, including investors, could look into the future and anticipate the behavior of self -interested governments, so that a discretionary monetary policy could end up being compromised by government pressures, leaving inflationary expectations unanchored, whereas a monetary policy committed to a rule would be harder to bend and keep inflationary expectations at bay.6  Following several episodic bouts of double -digit inflation, a war on inflation  and inflationary expectations,  was finally launched in September 2013 by the then Governor Raghuram G Rajan; the  Urjit Patel Committee Report to Revise and Strengthen the  Monetary Policy Framework was released in 2014 ; and, finally, the Reserve Bank of India Act was modified in August 2016 to constitute the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) .   The MPC  consists of three RBI members, including the Governor who reserves a casting vote, and three external memb ers appointed by the government. The MPC  has been legislatively awarded a flexible inflation -targeting mandate  of achieving 4% consumer price index (CPI) inflation in the medium term, while paying attention to growth, with operational independence to achieve it , and with accountability in terms of transparency around the MPC\u2019s  resolution, minutes summarising  each individual committee member\u2019s decision, bi -annual monetary policy reports, and a written report to the government  in case a +/ - 2% band around the target inflation level is violated for three quarters in a row .                                                               6 See also Buiter and Sibert (2000), who lay out the theoretical basis for the required legal and institutional arrangements, primarily operational  independence of the central bank, for an effective monetary policy.  10  The MPC, two years old since, has attempted steadfastly through its rate -setting decisi ons to build credibility  of the inflation target, a process  that is generally believed , and empirically documented, to help lower  the long-term bond yields as well as  stabilise the exchange rate .   While the jury will remain out fo r some time on the economic impact of the flexible  inflation -targeting framework, it is incontrovertible that the MPC has given  monetary policy an independent institutional foundation. The government deserves much credit for its far -sightedness in legislating the required ch ange s to strengthen this aspect of central bank\u2019s independence and distancing itself in th e process from monetary decision- making (other than through the appointment of external members on the MPC) .  (2) Debt Management : For several decades post -independence, the Reserve Bank participated  in short -term Treasury Bill issuances of the Government of India  (bearing extraordinarily low interest rates) to fund its fiscal deficits .  The Reserve Bank also public ly acknowledged that its open market operations (OMOs) were primarily geared to manage the government bond yields .  This  implied that the central bank  balance- sheet  was always available as a resource \u2013 just like tax receipts  \u2013 ready to monetise excessive government spending.  Unsurprisingly, high inflation in India was engineered to please both Milton Friedman and Thomas Sargent, i.e., it was a lways both a monetary and a fiscal phenomenon, as these two Nobel laureates in economics had respectively argued  (Friedman, 1970 a nd Sargent, 1982).  Eventually, recognizing the fiscal imprudence and inflationary risks engendered by such automatic monetization of government deficits, joint efforts between the Reserve Bank and the government during 1994- 1997 limited deficit financing from the Reserve B ank to the cappe d Ways and Means Advances (WMA) . The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act of 2003 explicitly prohibited  the Reserve Bank from participating in primary issuance s of the government  securit ies. Open market operations came to be designed to sterilise the impact on domestic money supply of foreign exchange interventions and/or to meet durable liquidity needs of the economy, rather than to fund deficits . While there have been relapses to old ha bits, overall these  changes have left the task of government debt management with the Reserve Bank as primarily being one of auctioning government debt and helping it switch between securities or conduct buybacks, rather than of intricate involvement in fiscal planning, and more importantly, in its funding.  Furthermore , the repressive levels of Statutory Liquid Ratio (SLR) and Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), which ensured substantial portions of bank deposits were channeled to the government or were readily avai lable to debase in value through monetary expansion, have now been rationalised to be more or less in line with inte rnational prudential standards.  For instance, in case of SLR, the level has been steadily reduced and the plan is to harmonise it with the Basel III Liqu idity Coverage Ratio (LCR) .   11  (3) Exchange Rate Management : In the Five Year Plans post -independence, prices including the exchange rate  were assumed to be constant; however, since the true value of the Rupee fluctuated with market price s and macroeconomic conditi ons, the Sterling holdings had no choice but to take an undue hit.  The underlying true value of the Rupee was also affected heavily \u2013\u2013 but not reflected in reality \u2013\u2013 by monetary policy and debt management operations that were  implicitly supporting the  ballooning of government deficits.  The result of the fixed exchange rate regime in the midst of  \u201cfiscal dominance\u201d was that the Reserve Bank was essentially a  silent  spectator in the build -up to the inevitable exchange rate disequilibrium  (though arguably this was true of much of the world at that time).  Since 1976, when the level of the Rupee moved to being a \u201cmanaged float\u201d against a basket of currencies, and especially since 1993, the exchange rate has gradually evolved from being entirely a fixed rate t o being market -determined for all practical purposes . The Reserve Bank deploys  reserves management and  macro -prudential controls on foreign capital  flows to manage excessive ly large movements . With a flexible inflation -targeting mandate for interest- rate policy and funding of fiscal deficit no longer  the objective of monetary operations, the desired exchange rate management rests with the Reserve B ank.  Ongoing Challenges in Maintaining Independence of the Reserve Bank of India  Few important pockets of persistent weakness, however, remain  in maintaining independence of the Reserve Bank .  Some of these areas were also  identified in the 2017 Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) of India by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) as ways to strengthen the independence of the Reserve Bank, an area in which the FSAP rates India as \u201cmaterially non- compliant\u201d .   (1) Regulation of Public Sector Banks: One important limitation is that the Reserve Bank is statutorily limited in undertaking the full scope of actions against public sector banks (PSBs) \u2013 such as asset divestiture, replacement of management and Board, licens e revocation, and resolution actions such as mergers or sales \u2013\u2013 all of which it can and does deploy effectively in case of private banks. The significant implications of this limitation were highlighted in detail in Governor Patel\u2019s speech in March 2018, Banking Regulatory Powers should be Ownership Neutral . To reite rate from the FSAP (Para 39 in Summing up Responsibilities, Objectives, Powers, Independence, and Accountabilities, the B asel Core Principles Deta iled Assessment Report ):   \u201cLegislation should be ame nded to enable the RBI to extend all the powers currently exercised over private sector banks to PSBs; in particular, regarding Board member dismissals, mergers and license revocation. \u2026  It should also remove the option of an appeal to the government when the RBI revokes a license.  If statutory changes are difficult, the RBI and the government should consider adopting a framework agreement 12  whereby the government would acknowledge the RBI\u2019s full operational authority and independence in supervision and regulation, as they did recently for  monetary policy.\u201d   (2) The Reserve Bank\u2019s Balance- sheet Strength:  Having adequate reserves to bear any losses that arise from central bank operations and having appropriate rules to allocate profits (including rules that govern the accumulation of capital and reserves) is considered an important part of central bank\u2019s independence from the government (see, for example, Moser -Boehm, 2006). A thorny ongoing issue on this front has been that of the rules for surplus transfer from the Reserve Bank to the governmen t (Cogencis, 2018, \u201cGovt pegs RBI excess capital at 3.6 trln rupees, seeks it as surplus\u201d ), an issue  that relates closely to the leading Argentine exampl e in my introductory remarks.  It has been covered deftly by Rakesh Mohan (2018) in the last  of his three -part series of recent articles  on the Reserve Bank , titled Protect the RBI\u2019s balance- sheet; therein, he  elucidates  why a cen tral bank needs a strong balance -sheet to perform its full range of critical functions for the economy.  I quote his main points below:   \u201cFirst, \u2026  The longer -term fiscal consequences would be the same if the government issued new securities today to fund the expenditure. [R]aiding the RBI\u2019s capital creates no new government revenue on a net basis over time, and only provides an illusion of free money in the short term.\u201d   \u201cSecond, \u2026 The use of such a transfer would erode whatever confidence that exists in the government\u2019s intention to practice fiscal prudence.\u201d   \u201cThird, \u2026 In theory, a central bank can implement monetary policy appropriately with a wide range of capital levels, including levels below zero. In practice, the danger is that it may lose credibility with the financial markets and public at large, and may then be unable to attain its objective if it has substantial losses and is seen as  havin g insufficient capital.   Are fears with regard to possible central bank losses illusory? According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), 43 out of 108 central banks reported losses for at least one year between 1984 and 2005.  It is also argued by some that the government can always recapitalise a central bank when necessary. This is certainly true in principle but is practically difficult when the government itself suffers from fiscal pressures and maintains a relatively high debt -GDP ratio, as  is the case in India. What is also important is the erosion of central bank independence both in reality and perhaps, even more importantly, in optics. \u2026   Once again, better sense has prevailed and the government has not raided the RBI\u2019s balance sheet.\u201d   13  (3) Regulatory Scope: A final issue is one of regulatory scope, the most recent case in point being the recommendation to bypass the central bank\u2019 s powers over payment  and settlement systems by appointing a separate payments regulator (also covered by Rakesh Mohan in his series, ibid). The Reserve Bank has published its dissent note against this recommendation  on October 19, 2018.  Conclusion Let me conclu de with some notes of gratitu de and dedication as well as some for  further reflection.  Mr. Malegam  has been  a long- time adviser, friend and well -wisher of the Reserve Bank of India, as well  as its former Board Member.  He is someone I personally admire for his int ellect, clarit y of thinking and sagacity.  I thank you, Mr. Malegam,  for inviting me to deliver the  A D Shroff Memorial Lecture for this year.    The Late Ardashir Darabshaw Shroff  served as India\u2019s non -official delegate in 1944 at the United Nations \u201cBretton Woods Conference\u201d on post -war financial and monetary arrangements.  One of his primary concerns was to seek a permanent seat on the executive board of the International Monetar y Fund and the World Bank, which unfortunately did not materialise. To me, his most important contribution was the co -founding in 1954 of the Free Forum Enterprise think tank which through open dialogue presented a counterpoint to the socialist tendencies that were t aking root in the country in the post -independence era  government .  Sucheta Dalal\u2019s biography, A. D. Shroff -  Titan of Finance and Free Enterprise (2000), notes that George Woods, one of the most popular presidents of the World Bank, said of him : \u201cNobody could accuse A. D. Shroff of hiding his opinions and in the later years of his life, very rarely were those opinions fashionable in India. Yet few patriots did more than he [did] to make friends for the Indian nation and to build confidence in that nation among those throughout the world whose business it is to provide capital for sound investment opportunities.\u201d  In all humility , to emulate A. D. Shroff\u2019s freedom to criticize policy \u201cactuated by the single motive of trying to promote the good of my country\u201d  (from his letter to Sir Osborne Smith, the first Governor of the Reserve Bank), I chose for today\u2019s occasion the theme of the  importance of  independent  regulatory institutions, and in particular,  that of a central bank that is independent from an over-arching reach of the state. This theme is certainly one of great sensitivity but I contend it is of even gr eater importance to our economic prospects .  I earnestly hope that I have  done some justice to his immortal legacy  to independent economic di scourse and policy- making.  In the process, I have  attempted to convince  you that we have made good progress  in earnin g the Reserve Bank\u2019s independence, most notably in the monetary policy framework  (changes wherein, along with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the Goods and Services Tax, were considered as crucial structural reforms by Moody\u2019s in  upgrading India\u2019s sovereign rating eleven  months back) . To secure greater financial and macroeconom ic stability, these efforts need to be extended to effective independence for the Reserve Bank in its regu latory and supervisory 14  powers over public sector banks , its balance- sheet strength , and its regulatory scope.  Such endeavor would be a true inclusive  reform for the Indian economy\u2019s future . Thankfully, it is only  a matter of making the  right choices, which I believe as a society we can with adequate ly thoughtful  \u201cwhat -if\u201d analysis ; I have sketch ed a scenario, which several parts of the world are presently witnessing, of  great risk to nations  from  undermining the independence of their central banks . In his excellent biography, Volcker:  The Triumph of Persistence (2012) , my former NYU Stern colleague, Bill Silber, describes in vivid detail how in th e 1980s, the then Federal Reserve Governor Paul Volcker adopted a curmudgeonly approach to setting int erest rates to target inflation.  Besides resisting any and all pressure to keep rates low , which would have  effectively allow ed cheap funding \u2013 in the short term \u2013 of President Reagan\u2019s expansionary deficit -based manifesto, Volcker engaged personally with the President to convey the perils of running high fiscal deficits right  after double -digit inflation had just been tamed. In the end, Volcker w on the day as wise counsel prevailed , deficits were reined in , and inflation tamed even further . I woul d argue that  through Volcker \u2019s tough stance on inflation and candour on risks from government\u2019s fiscal plans, the institution of the Federal Reserve had in fact been  President Reagan\u2019s true friend. As many parts of the world today await  greater g overnment respect fo r central bank independence, independent central banker s will remain undeterred . Governments that do not respect  central bank independence  will sooner or later incur  the wrath of financial markets, ignite economic fire, and come to rue the day they undermined an important regulatory institution; their wiser counterparts who invest in central bank independence will enjoy lower costs of borrowing, the love of international investors, and longer life spans .

I intend speaking  on the possible implications of global imbalances for the emerging mar ket economies (EMEs) with special focus on India. Although fast growing economies are generally grouped t ogether as EMEs 2, some of their major macroeconomic indicators present a w ide spectrum. While some of the EMEs are running large current account  surpluses (such as China, the Russian Federation, South Korea, Venezuela,  Malaysia, Taiwan and Brazil), some others are running current account deficits ( such as Turkey, Hungary, South Africa, Mexico, India and the Czech Repub lic) and their current account balances range from a deficit of US$ 20 billion  to a surplus of US $ 69 billion. While savings rates for select EMEs range from n ine per cent to 43 per cent of the GDP, in most of the EMEs the rates have incre ased and overtaken those of the industrial countries, with particularly high  savings rates in China, Malaysia and Russia.  Likewise, while some of the EMEs have fiscal surplus (Russia), several others have fiscal deficit (Turkey, India, t he Philippines, Argentina and several other EMEs).  Also, while some of the EMEs such as India are largely domestic-demand driven, some other EMEs, part icularly in the East Asia (Malaysia and the Philippines) are largely dependen t on exports to sustain their growth and their exports of goods and services rang e from 15 per cent to over 120 per cent of GDP.   It is useful to note that w hile some of the EMEs are net oil exporters, some others are net oil importers. Thus, given the diverse nature, macroeconomic conditions and  policy regimes of the EMEs, it may be difficult to treat all o f them as contributing to                                                           1 Remarks by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank o f India at the round table discussion at the International Symposium organized by the Banque  de France on November 4, 2005 at Paris. 2 There is no single acceptable definition of EMEs, although they are commonly referred to as economies with high growth prospects. The IMF in it s latest Global Financial Stability Report has categorised the following countries as EMEs: Latin America  \u2013 Argentina, Brazil, Chile Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela; Asia  \u2013 China, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Taiwan Province of China and Thailand;  Europe, Middle East and Africa  \u2013 Czech Republic, Egypt, Hungary, Israel, Jordon, Morocco, Poland, Russia, South Africa and Turkey. Select economic indicators of select EMEs are furni shed in the Annex. global financial imbalances, in the same manner, nor wo uld all the EMEs be identically affected by the adjustment of global fina ncial imbalances. It may, therefore, be somewhat difficult to speak about the imp lications of global financial imbalances for the EMEs as a group.  I would, therefo re, focus primarily on India, but the analytic framework could perhaps be of some help in appreciating the implications for different EMEs. It is worthwhile to mention that there are some factor s which could adversely impact the EMEs as a group, though with varying i ntensity. Global developments, particularly those in the world financial m arkets, have the most direct and serious impact on the financing conditions in t he emerging markets. An abrupt and sharp adjustment of the currencies may pote ntially lead to a significant portfolio rebalancing by the foreign invest ors, which could cause sharp changes in the long-term yields.  This, in turn, could re sult in volatility in the level and cost of capital flows with direct implications for the  EMEs. Volatility in financial markets could adversely affect the EMEs in many ways, and also in a complex and interrelated fashion. Fo r convenience of analysis, the impact may be classified broadly into: (i) th e impact on the financing conditions in which EMEs operate; (ii) impairment of t he balance sheets of the banking sector, and (iii) hampering of the growth prosp ects in the real sector. Even within the same EMEs, the impact could vary across diffe rent entities such as the Government, the corporate sector, the households an d the financial sector, depending upon the country-specific and institution -specific operating environment, the stage of development and the degree o f integration with and exposure to the international financial markets. In view  of the diversity of the EMEs and the complexity of impact of any unpredictable unw inding of global imbalances, it is proposed to analyse the possible implicat ions, illustratively, with reference to India Recent Macroeconomic Developments in India There are several noteworthy features of India\u2019s recent macroeconomic performance. First, the investment climate ha s improved and industrial and service sector activity has picked up. Second, bu oyant exports have emerged as the driver of demand for a broad spectru m of industries. Third, there has been a modest attempt at and a commitment to  achieve fiscal consolidation.  Fourth, the trend inflation has decline d over the years and inflation expectations stabilised. Fifth, India has been successful in managing liquidity against the backdrop of continuing capital flows. Sixth, India has emerged as a preferred destination for foreign investors and received about a quarter of the global portfolio flows to the EMEs in 2004. Seventh, I ndia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves are in excess of the total outstanding external debt of the country. Eighth, the performance of the corporate sector has impr oved and some corporates are now listed on the international stock exch anges. Ninth, India\u2019s financial markets have deepened, widened and become vibra nt over the years with a robust institutional framework and market infrast ructure in place. Tenth, the profitability and soundness indicators of the banking sector have improved. Finally, India has been adopting international benchma rks for financial standards and best practices with suitable adaptations for Indian co nditions. The Indian economy today is characterised by an environment of confidence, positive business expectations, a renewal of ru le-based fiscal consolidation, stable and orderly financial markets and in stitutions and progressive integration with the global economy. Real GD P growth for 2005-06 (April-March) has been conservatively projected at around 7 .0 per cent, and more recently, revised upwards to a range of 7.0 to 7.5 per cent. Despite the sustained strength of export performance, the merchandise  trade deficit is expected to be somewhat higher in 2005-06 than in the  previous year, mainly on account of substantially higher oil prices and non-oil imp ort demand for investment. For the year as a whole, while invisibles may finance a large part of the enlarged trade deficit, the current account deficit is expected to widen during 2005-06 but to remain within acceptable limits that can  be financed by normal capital flows. The headline inflation is expected to li e in the range of 5.0-5.5 per cent. Consolidation of Central Government finances is the  goal of fiscal policy at the Centre \u2013 the targets are: the gross fiscal deficit (G FD) of 3.0 per cent of GDP and the elimination of the revenue deficit by 2008-09.  The fiscal position of State Governments also continues to undergo slight correction in terms of key deficit indicators. Against this background, it may be useful to analyse the im plications of global financial imbalances for India in terms of the l ikely impact on four separate balance sheets - of the government, of the Reserve Bank o f India, of the corporate sector and of the banking sector. Impact on the Government The Government of India does not raise resources from the  international capital markets to finance the fiscal deficit, though the bilateral and multilateral sources do provide moderate amount of foreign currency fun ds.  The Government could, therefore, be affected indirectly thro ugh the spill-over impact of external developments on domestic interest rates. What  is of relevance, inter alia , is the nominal international interest rates and dome stic interest rates, adjusted for inflation differential.  To the extent there is a rise in domestic interest rates, there could be an increase in the cost of governmen t borrowings of the Government. Since most of the outstanding debt is at fix ed rates and not on floating rates, the rise in the borrowing cost will be incremental. This situation also provides greater headroom for a flexible monetary policy to adjust policy rates, as and when warranted, without any excessive impact on the fiscal deficit. Impact on the Reserve Bank's Balance Sheet The fiscal position of the Government could also be indir ectly impacted through the nature of management of foreign exchange  reserves held by the Reserve Bank. Volatility in the foreign exchange market e xposes foreign exchange reserves to both operational and market risks. Dep reciation in the value of any reserve currency vis-\u00e0-vis  the domestic currency would result in an equivalent decline in the value of the reserves held, tho ugh the impact may be mitigated to some extent through appreciation of othe r currencies in which foreign exchange reserves are held. Also, increase in glob al interest rates would entail capital losses on the corresponding assets, including fixed income securities.  Valuation and capital losses could impact the income of the Reserve Bank of India and thus, its surplus transferable to the G overnment which, in turn, would have fiscal implications. It is pertinent to mentio n that the Reserve Bank of India, as a matter of prudent practice, follows conservati ve accounting norms whereby the valuation gains/losses on foreign exchange rese rves and gold are not taken to the profit and loss account, but instead, bo oked under a separate reserve head. Impact on the Indian Corporates As a result of deterioration in global financial marke t conditions, spreads on corporate debt might widen suddenly due to shift in investor confidence in the global financial markets. Increase in the global intere st rates may also have impact on other benchmarks such as LIBOR. A sharp rise in yie lds may entail an increase in cost of variable-rate debt contracted by the cor porates. This, to some extent, could be offset if there is a depreciation of t he relevant currency and consequent decline in the value of the existing debt cont racted by corporates in that currency. Indian corporates as also some of the public sector enterpr ises raise resources from the international capital markets. While a  part of their external commercial borrowings is at variable interest rate, a par t is at fixed interest rates. In order to avoid any serious impact of changes in the exch ange rate on the balance sheet of the corporate sector, Reserve Bank has bee n advising banks to regularly monitor the unhedged position of the corpor ates and has also been exhorting corporates to hedge their foreign exchange e xposures. Thus, India's corporates could be affected by the deterioration in the  financing conditions only to the extent they are not hedged either by foreign-cu rrency cash flows in the normal course of business or through recourse to appropria te hedging products. Corporates would, however, be affected to the extent i nterest rates firm up in the domestic market, depending on their exposure to debt re lative to other liabilities. Impact on the Banking Sector Banks in India are dependent mainly on domestic deposits, predominantly at fixed rates, for their resource requirements. They wo uld, therefore, be impacted significantly only if the  adverse developments in  the international capital markets are particularly severe.  Banks, in general,  also do not hold stock of securities in foreign currency. Banks in India have, thus,  relatively small exposure to the foreign exchange market. Their foreign  currency borrowings are subject to the prudential limit of 25 per cent of thei r Tier-I capital and they are also required to maintain capital against the net open  position. Foreign currency borrowings by the banks are permitted beyond this ceiling,  which is linked to the net worth, exclusively for the purpose of export finance.Like many other emerging market economies, credit extend ed by banks in India has increased sharply in recent times. Credit growth , which was earlier seen largely in housing and retail loans, has now turned  quite broad-based with agriculture and industry also joining to drive up the cre dit demand.  The credit growth in some sectors, specially those related to assets which  are experiencing price volatilities, is being monitored closely. Banks are allowed to lend to resident exporters in fore ign currency at internationally competitive rates of interest from their  foreign currency lines of credit as well as out of funds available in exchange ear ners' foreign currency accounts, resident foreign currency accounts and foreign curre ncy non-resident (banks) accounts. These loans are intended to finance domest ic and imported inputs for export production. Foreign currency loans to e xporters are generally hedged against credit risk since they are extended for bona fide  underlying activity viz., export production. They are also usually covered  for exchange risk since they are denominated in foreign currency. Banks are a lso allowed to extend loans in foreign currency to non-resident Indians against their FCNRB deposits. Funds in foreign currency deposits can also be util ized for lending to domestic corporates for working capital requirements in In dia, import financing, purchase of indigenous machinery, repayment of rupee term  loans and external commercial borrowings. Banks have also been extending credit for investment in t he asset market. Like many other EMEs, asset prices in India have also risen sh arply in the last couple of years.  Should there be reversal of capital flo ws, asset prices may decline sharply exposing the banks\u2019 balance sheets to credi t risk.  There is a risk that rise in interest rates in general could impact housi ng prices and expose the balance sheet of the households to interest rate risk, le ading to some loan losses for banks. The overall banking sector\u2019s exposure to housing loans is relatively small and may not have serious systemic implications. Likewise, the equity market has also seen a sustained uptrend. Reversal of capita l flows could impact the equity market and some of the advances extended for i nvestments in the equity market might turn non-performing.  Again, Indi an banks do not have large exposure in the asset market though, in the recent past, it has been increasing. Decline in asset prices could cause loan losses and capital losse s, if the decline is significant, though the impact on banks\u2019 balance sheets might be muted, given their small exposure to the asset market. The most significant impact on banks\u2019 balance sheet, however , could be felt through their investment portfolio. Banks in India  hold substantial investments in Government and other fixed income securities. Such inve stments amounted to US $ 173 billion, constituting 35.1 per cent of their total assets as on September 16, 2005.  To the extent a rise in international int erest rates impacts the domestic interest rates, it would entail marked-to-market losses on  the investment portfolios. The banking sector, however, has acquired some added streng th to absorb such probable shocks, largely aided by regulatory actio ns. Apart from having built up a significant capital base reflected in the capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) for the sector of 12%, specific steps have  been taken to meet the interest rate risk. First, separate provision for  capital against market risk has been introduced. Second, a gradual building up of Investment Fluctuation Reserve up to 5% of the marked-to-market portfolio (out  of tax-free profits) by March 2006 has been mandated, and several banks have alrea dy achieved the target. Third, an enabling risk management environment  has been provided to banks to hedge their risks through vanilla derivative instr uments. Fourth, Conservative accounting norms followed did not allow banks to book unrealized gains. Fifth, as a one time measure, banks were allowed to transfer securities to HTM, after booking the MTM losses against these. Thus, ban ks in India, in general, have the resilience to withstand some rise in in terest rates. Impact on the Real Sector Readjustment of the currencies would also have implicati ons for the real sector.  Significant readjustment of the currencies and ri se in interest rates could slow down the global growth. This would entail a redu ction in export opportunities and reduction in investment demand for EMEs, in genera l, many of which depend on export demand to sustain their growth. Rise in interest rates, by slowing down spending, may have a negative impact on the global economic growth.  Thus, readjustment of the currencies may affect se veral EMEs in a significant way. The impact of any slowdown on India may be assessed with re ference to two factors. First, India's economy is largely domestic-deman d driven. While India\u2019s exports constituted 11.5 per cent of GDP, its sha re in the world trade is only 0.8 per cent. Second, India's exports basket is fairly diversified. Some concerns arise with regard to the implications for e mployment in case of a slowdown in the exports sector, especially with re gard to the significant specialisation in BPO/IT Enable Services.  Rapid job gro wth that absorbs the huge supply of agricultural labour into its industrial w ork force is necessary for socio-economic stability in India. Any negative impact on em ployment resulting in substantial decrease of real earnings and widening income  inequality is likely to reduce overall welfare and increase the cost of structural adjustments required, especially in the absence of meaningful social safety nets.  Monetary and Prudential Measures as responses The outlook for output growth in India has improved in  the recent months, particularly with the momentum gained in manufacturing  sector. However, persistence of global imbalances and high oil prices with  a significant permanent component do pose some risks.  Furthermore, the credit gr owth has recently been extremely strong possibly impacting credit quality, wh ile money-supply is over-shooting the anticipated trajectory and strong investm ent demand coupled with high oil-prices is turning the current account surplu s into a deficit, though modest and manageable through normal capital flows.  T hese developments pose new challenges to maintaining price and financial  stability while ensuring momentum in growth.  Consequently, in the Mid-Term Re view of Annual Policy Statement for the year 2005-06, released on October 25 , 2005, several measures have been announced to contain and manage the downside  risks. First, the reverse-repo rate (overnight liquidity absorpt ion by Reserve Bank) has been increased by 25 basis points to 5.25 per cent , keeping the spread between reverse repo and repo at 100 basis points.   The Bank Rate, being the signalling rate for medium term, is retaine d at 6.00 per cent. Second, rationalization of limits on banks\u2019 exposure to ca pital market has been announced, restricting it to 40 per cent of a bank\u2019 s net worth while simplifying the exemptions and coverage. Third, the general provisioning requirement for stand ard advances has been enhanced from the present level of 0.25 per cent t o 0.40 per cent except in regard to Banks\u2019 exposures to laggards in credit-growth, namely, Agriculture and Small and Medium Industries. Fourth, a decision had been taken to treat the entire balance under Investment Fluctuation Reserve as Tier I capital, thus provi ding some head-room to banks to raise Tier II capital in future. Fifth, revised guidelines are being issued on corporate r estructuring mechanisms to be followed by banks in the light of experi ence gained. Sixth, having regard to the recent trends in the credi t markets, RBI is initiating a supervisory review process with select banks having  significant exposure to some sectors, namely, real estate, highly lever aged non-banking financial companies, venture capital funds and capital mar kets.  The purpose of such a review is to ensure that effective risk mitigants and sound internal controls are in place for managing such exposures. Some Reflections From the above discussion, it is clear that the Impact on I ndia would depend on the pace and extent of currency and current acco unt readjustments, and changes in global interest rates. While India by itse lf hardly contributes to global financial imbalances, any large and rapid adjustm ents in major currencies and related interest rates or current accounts of trading  partners could indirectly impact the Indian economy. From the case of India, it is also clear that readjustmen t of the currencies and rise in interest rates would impact different EMEs d ifferently. Despite rise in short-term interest rates, long-term interest rates, in stead of rising, have moderated, leading to a further flattening of the g lobal yield curve and narrowing down of credit spreads. EMEs have taken advantage of favour able financial conditions. During the first half of 2005, EMEs focused o n operations aimed at meeting domestic and external obligations and lengthen ing maturities. However, higher global interest rates could contribute to wideni ng of emerging market bond spreads, particularly those with high debt to GDP ratio.  In view of expected deceleration in financial conditions, some emerging marke ts have cushioned by advancing their external financing, taking advantage of current benign financial market conditions. Emerging market economies have, however,  continued to improve their debt structures in an effort towards reduci ng their vulnerability to external shocks. EMEs have carried out active liability manag ement operations aimed at meeting their financial requirements while m inimising the cost of debt and its risks. Some countries have taken steps to develop thei r local markets and have reduced the amount of foreign currency-linked domesti c debt, while gradually improving the maturity profile. Some of the EMEs have also reduced the share of domestic debt indexed to the exchange rate . Compared to the past crises, the EMEs, in general, are now resilient and in a better position to absorb a financial shock. They have  developed resilience to shocks by improving their macroeconomic conditions and regu latory frameworks. EMEs have been achieving a healthy growth with  more or less stable inflation and have reduced their dependence on external demand. There has also been an improvement in fiscal positions, supporte d by the development of domestic securities markets.  The external debt burden  has declined and the composition of financial flows has changed with lower rel iance on borrowings from international banks. Several EMEs have addressed the weaknesses that led to the earlier crisis by strengthening prudential regula tion and supervision more in line with international best practices. Banks\u2019 balance sheets have improved and capital ratios have risen. Corporate governance practi ces have also improved. To the extent EMEs have introduced flexibility in their exchange rates, their vulnerability to external shocks has declined. All th ese factors have reduced the vulnerability of EMEs.  Large reserves held by EMEs shou ld also enable them to cope with the volatility arising out of a sudden  shift in market sentiment. While macroeconomic fundamentals of several EMEs are strong , placing them in a relatively better position to withstand deter ioration in international financing conditions, economic performance of some EMEs has been found to be less robust. The conditions in these economies may get accentu ated by adjustment of global financial imbalances and high and  volatile oil prices. A possible volatility in the global financial markets emanat ing from a rise in interest rates could magnify and propagate the problems associated with less than satisfactory performance in some of the EMEs, making them vu lnerable to sudden reassessment of country risk. Such threats are real as the default rates of sub-investment grade borrowers could increase. Credit d erivatives, which have proliferated in recent years and whose pricing has de pended on relatively untested models and default correlation assumptions, may i n particular be vulnerable to corrections. The main challenge for EMEs is to continue to take advant age of the current favourable external financing conditions and at  the same time pursue domestic macroeconomic and structural reforms necessary for lon g-term stability. In fact, some EMEs have well-advanced external f inancing, in some cases even including prefinancing for 2006 3.  EMEs have made significant gains in terms of healthy growth, stable inflation, large tr ade surplus, greater exchange rate flexibility and lower debt burden.  While EMEs a re preparing  themselves to face sudden shocks, efforts need to be made by all concerned  for an orderly adjustment of global financial imbalances. While co-ord inated policy action would minimise the cost of rebalancing, perhaps, a stress testing by all the concerned regulators in the EMEs to assess the extent of the resilie nce could be helpful. The EMEs, despite their diversity, seem to generate expect ations of high growth and are generally characterized by less-than-fully d eveloped markets, specially financial markets.  Consequently, there are signi ficant cross-border capital flows, with market perception of high risk and hi gh reward in EMEs.  It is useful to note that implicit in the word \u201cemerging\u201d i n the very title given to the EMEs as a group, is the notion that they are undergoing  a rapid change or transition.  We must recognize that the transition embra ces demographics, political institutions, social dimensions and related at titudes.  These all- encompassing changes have an in-built potential for uncer tainties, possibly some volatility, but it gets exacerbated by the internationa l capital flows, particularly when the changes in such flows happen to be unrelated to  domestic fundamentals.  In such a situation, managing the transit ion turns out to be a critical challenge for policy making, and the management requires a more difficult and dynamic trade off between commitment and flexibili ty in policy. Overall, while added risks \u2013 both upside and downside \u2013 a re inevitable with increasing global financial and economic integrat ion, the EMEs may consider strengthening their resilience through not only sound macroeconomic management but also by adopting appropriate prudentia l measures. Over a period, co-ordinated efforts, both at regional as well  as global levels, could also help EMEs to cushion themselves better against the risks of f inancial globalisation. Thank you,                                                                                                                                                                             3 Global Financial Stability Report, September 2005,  IMF.Annex Select Economic Indicators \u2013 Select Emerging Market  Economies (US $ billion)  Country GDP (growth rate) 1Inflation rate 1Trade Balance 2Current Account 2Foreign Reserve s3Exter- nal Debt 4Overall Budget Balance to GDP 5Export of goods and services to GDP @1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Argentina 10.1 9.7 11.2 2.8 24.4 166.2 -3.3 24.0 Brazil 3.9 6.0 40.1 12.5 54.6 235.4 -1.5 @22.5 Chile 6.5 3.0 8.7 0.6 15.8 43.2 -0.3 38.0 China 9.5 1.3 93.1 68.7 711.0 193.6 -1.7 @40.2 Colombia 5.3 4.9 1.8 -0.8 14.9 33.0 - 19.1 Czech Republic 5.1 1.7 1.3 -4.1 30.2 34.6 -  - Egypt 4.7 4.7 -9.5 4.4 18.5 31.4 - 25.5 Hungary 4.1 3.6 -3.4 -9.2 18.0 45.8 -  - India 7.0 4.1 -34.7 -6.4 133.6 113.5 -4.5 @15.4 Indonesia 5.5 8.3 27.8 7.8 31.0 134.4 -1.2 31.3 Israel 4.8 1.6 -7.7 1.3 27.8  - -  - Malaysia 4.1 3.7 23.6 16.7 78.0 49.1 - 121.3 Mexico 3.1 4.0 -9.6 -8.4 66.4 140.0 -0.3 @30.1 Peru 4.9 1.2 4.0 0.4 12.8  - -1.8 19.6 Philippines 4.8 7.2 -0.7 2.9 15.3 62.7 -4.0 52.0 Poland 2.8 1.6 -3.3 0.3 39.4 95.2 - 22.6 Russia 6.1 12.4 110.6 69.2 146.0 175.3 4.4 @25.6 South Africa 4.5 3.9 -2.3 -8.6 17.2 27.8 -1.0 28.2 South Korea 3.3 2.0 26.0 21.3 206.6  - -  - Taiwan 3.0 3.6 1.7 13.3 254.1  - -  - Thailand 4.4 5.6 -7.3 -2.2 47.3 51.8 -2.8  - Turkey 4.2 7.9 -38.9 -20.0 42.9 145.7 -19.6 27.0 Venezuela 11.1 14.8 24.7 17.7 23.1 34.9 - 35.7 1.

", "19 May 15 MP.pdf": "1 Going Bust for Growth1There are few areas of robust growth around the world, with the IMF repeatedly reducing its growth forecasts in recent quarters. This period of slow growth is particularly dangerous because both industrial countries and emerging markets need high growth to quell ris ing domestic political tensions. Policies that attempt to divert growth from others rather than create new growth are more likely under these circumstances. Even as we create conditions for sustainable growth, we need new rules of the game, enforced impartially by multilateral organizations, to ensure countries adhere to international responsibilities.  The conventional diagnosis and remedy Why is the world finding it so hard to restore pre-Great Recession growth rates? The obvious answer is that the financial boom preceding the Great Recession left industrial countries with an overhang of debt, and debt, whether on governments, households, or banks, is holding back growth.2 While the remedy may be to write down debt so as to revive demand from theindebted, it is debatable whether additional debt fuelled demand is sustainable in the long run. At any rate, large-scale debt write-offs (or fiscal transfers to the heavily indebted) seem politically difficult even if they are economically warranted. How does one offset weak household and government demand if debt write-downs are off the table ? Ideally, the response would be to incentivize investment and job creation through low interest rates and tax incentives. But if final demand from consumers is likely to be very weak for a considerable period of time because of debt overhang, the real return on new investment may collapse. The Wicksellian neutral real rate \u2013 loosely speaking the interest rate required to bring the economy back to full employment with stable inflation -- may even be strongly negative.3 This typically has been taken as grounds for aggressive monetary policy.Because policy rates cannot be reduced significantly below zero (though a number of European countries are testing the se limits), equilibrium long term interest rates may stay higher than levels necessary to incentivize investment. Hence, central banks have embarked on unconventional monetary policy (UMP), which would directly lower long rates. Another way to stimulate demand is for governments that still have the ability to borrow to increase spending. Since this will increase already-high levels of government debt, proponents suggest investing in infrastructure, which may have high returns today when 1 Remarks by Dr. Raghuram Rajan, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India on May 19, 2015 to the Economic Club  of New York. Rajan thanks Dr. Prachi Mishra of the Reserve Bank for very useful comments and research support.  2 See the interesting e vidence in Atif Mian and Amir Sufi,  House of Debt  (Princeton University Press,  New Jersey , 2014)  and the cross -country evidence in  Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff , This Time is Different   (Princeton University Press, New Jersey, 2008). For an illuminati ng overall view of the global financial crisis and the policy remedies , see  Martin Wolf, The Shifts and  the Shocks: What We've Learned and Have Still to Learn from the Financial Crisis  (Penguin USA 2015).  3 Though see a thoughtful piece by Claudio Borio and Piti Disyatat at http://www.voxeu.org/article/low-interest-rates-secular-stagnation-and-debt  suggesting that the real neutral interest rate may be influenced by low policy rates. Intuitively, the authors argue that low policy rates can sow the seeds for investment misallocation, financial distress, and debt overhang, all of which can combine to drive down the future real return on investment, and therefore the real neutral long term rate today.    2   construct ion costs and interest rates are low. However , high-return  infrastructure investment is harder  to identify and implement in developed countries where most obvious investments have already been made \u2013 political influence is as likely to create bridges to no where or unviable high speed train networks as needed infrastructure . Also, while everyone can see the need for repair and renovation of existing infrastructure, this requires far more decentralized spending than mega projects, and may be harder to initiat e and finance from the centre.  Put differently, high-return  infrastructure investment is a good idea but may be hard to implement on a large scale for most advanced country governments.  To the extent that such debt fuelled spending creates a self -fulfill ing virtuous cycle of confidence and activity, it can be a bridge to sustainable growth. But to the extent that it misallocates capital (because there are insufficient \u201cshovel -ready\u201d projects , so much of the emergency spending is diverted to rent-seeking p ork), it can worsen public anxieties about the future, reducing corporate investment and increasing household savings.  All t his highlights  another concern.

The arguments I have just enunciated for action apply to an economy where nothing fundamentally is wron g except perhaps excessive debt  \u2013 what is needed is a cyclical return of growth to potential growth . Yet a number of economists such as Tyler Cowen, Robert Gordon, and Larry Summers have raised the possibility that potential growth in industrial countries had fallen even before the Great Recession. Perhaps the n the growth that we are trying to return to  is unachievable without serious distortions.  The term \u201csecular stagnation\u201d used by Larry Summers to describe the current persistent economic malaise, echoin g Alvin Hansen\u2019s speech in 1938 in the midst of the Great Depression, has caught on.4 But different economists focus on different aspects and causes of the stagnation. 5 Summers emphasizes the inadequacy of aggregate demand, and the fact that the zero lowe r bound as well as the potential for financial instability prevents monetary policy from being more active. Among the reasons for weak aggregate demand include ageing populations that want to consume less and the increasing income share of the very rich, w hose marginal propensity to consume is small.  Tyler Cowe n and Robert Gordon on the other hand, emphasize a weak supply potential.6 They argue that the post -World War II years were an aberration because growth was helped in industrial countries by reconstr uction, the spread of technologies such as electricity,                                                             4 Summers, L.

Ho wever, post -war total factor productivity growth \u2013 the part of growth stemming from new ideas and methods of production \u2013 was lower than  its 1920 -50 high. More recently, not only has productivity growth fallen further  (with a temporary positive uptick towa rds the end of the 1990s because of the IT revolution) , but growth has been held back by the headwinds of plateauing education levels and labour participation rates, as well as a shrinking labour force in some countries because of population ageing.  It is obvious from these lists of factors that it is hard to disentangle the effects of weak aggregate demand from slow growth in potential supply. Population ageing contributes to both. Indeed, one may cause the other . For example, anticipating a sl owdown in growth potential, households, worried about impending retirement in the face of undeliverable pension and healthcare entitlements, may try and build savings. This will  depress demand further. Conversely, anticipated weak demand may reduce incentives for cor porations to invest  in physical and human capital , causing supply potential to grow more slowly.  Structural reforms, typically ones that increase competition, foster innovation, and drive institutional change, are the way to raise potential growth. But the se immediately hurt protected constituencies that have become accustomed to the rents they get from the status quo. Moreover, the gains to constituencies that are benefited are typically later and uncertain while the pain is immediate and its incidence cle ar. No wonder Jean -Claude Juncker, then Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, said at the height of the Euro crisis, \u201c We all know what to do , we just don't know how to get re -elected  after we've done it!\u201d  The Growth Imperative   If indeed fundamentals are such that that the industrial world has, and will, grow slowly for a while before new technologies and  new markets come to the rescue, would it be politically easy to settle for slower growth? After all,  per capita income is high in industrial countries, and a few y ears of slow growth would not be devastating at the aggregate level. Why is there so much of a political need for growth?  One reason is the need to fulfil government commitments. As sociologist Wolfgang Streeck writes , in the strong growth years of the 196 0s when visions of a \u201cGreat Society\u201d seemed attainable , industrial economies  made enormous promises  of social security to the wider public.7 Promises have been augmented since then in some countries by politically convenient (because hidden from budgets) b ut fiscally unsound increases in pension and old age healthcare commitments to public sector workers . And most recently, the government debt taken on before and after the Great Recession has added to government commitments, even while the Baby Boomer gener ation has started retiring in large numbers. Without the immediate promise of growt h, all these commitments c ould soon be seen as unsustainable.                                                              7 See \u201cThe Crises of Democratic Capitalism\u201d, Wolfgang Streeck, New Left Review  71, Sept/Oct 2011 . 4   Another reason to desire growth is that economies tend to favour insiders \u2013 those who have jobs for example. T he brunt of the joblessness caused by slow growth is born by new entrants to the labour market.  Not only are they unemployed in larger numbers, but the lifetime earnings of cohorts that enter the labour force in difficult times is lower. Growth is necessar y for inter -generational equity, especially because these are the generations that will be working to pay off commitments to older generations.  Given these are also the cohorts that can take to the streets, growth is essential for social harmony.  Not only are the benefits of growth unequally distributed across generations, they are also very unequally distributed within generation. Because of changes in technology and the expansion of global competition, routine repetitive jobs, whether done by the skilled or the unskilled, have diminished greatly in industrial countries. Many of these jobs, ranging from assembly line worker to legal aides or insurance clerks, have either been automated or outsourced. The desirable high -paying jobs are non -routine skilled on es such as that of a consultant or an app designer, but they require skills.  T he middle class recognizes that they need quality higher education and training to not slip into competing with the poor for low -skilled non -routine jobs such as security guard or gardener. B ut the poor quality early education they have received, as well as the prohibitive cost of quality higher education, puts many  better livelihoods  out of reach. With every percentage point of growth creating fewer \u201cgood\u201d jobs for the unskilled  or moderately skilled, more growth is needed to keep them happily employed. Equally, the rapid deterioration in skills for the unemployed is an additional reason to push for growth.  The Deflation Fear    Finally, a big factor persuading authorities in indu strial countries to push for higher growth is the fear of deflation. The canonical example here is Japan, where many are persuaded that the key mistake it made was to slip into deflation, which has persisted and held back growth.  A closer look at the Japa nese experience suggests th at it is by no means clear that its growth has been slower than warranted let alone that deflation caused slow growth. It is true that after its devastating crisis in the early 1990s, Japan may have prolonged the slowdown by not taking early action  to clean up its banking system or restructure over -indebted corporations. But once it took decisive action in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Japanese growth per capita or per worker looks comparable with other industrial countries  (Table 1).8 Slow aggregate Japanese economic growth may simply be because its population is shrinking, and fewer people are entering the labour force  rather than because it is underperforming other developed economies .                                                             8 I first learnt of these facts from Jean Claude Trichet.  For a more  comprehensive look at deflation, see Claudio Borio, Magdalena Erdem , Andrew Filardo  and Boris Hofmann , \u201cThe costs of deflations: a historical perspective \u201d, BIS Quarterly Review March 2015 .    5    Source. World Economic Outlook Database , IMF .  What about the deleterious effects of deflation? One worrisome effect of deflation is that if wages are downwardly -sticky, real wages rise and cause unemployment. Yet Japanese unemployment has average d 4.5%  between 2000 -2014 , compared to 6.4%  in th e US and 9.4%  in the Euro area  during the same period .9 In part, the Japanese have obtained wage flexibility by moving away from the old lifetime unemployment contracts for new hires to short term contracts.  Indeed, with the decline in union power across i ndustrial countries  and the increase in temporary or even \u201czero hour\u201d workers , downward wage flexibility may be significantly higher than previously estimated . While not without social costs, such flexibility allows an economy to cope with sustained deflat ion. Another concern has been that moderately low inflation spirals down into seriously large deflation, where the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates keeps real interest rates unconscionably high. Once again, it is not clear this happened in Japan.  In the years 1999  to 2012 , average CPI deflation ranged between  -0.01%  in 2004 to -1.3% in 2009 , but without any clear spiralling pattern  (Figure 1 ).  Source: World Economic Outlook  Database, IMF.                                                               9 Source. World Economic Outlook Database, IMF.  6   Even if deflation  is moderate , it may cause customers to  postpone purchases and increase savings in anticipation of a lower price in the future , especially if the zero lower bound raises real interest rates above their desired value. In Fig 2, we plot household savings as a share of GDP in Japan against the de flation rate . Again, it is hard to see a sustained pattern of higher savings with higher deflation . 0\t2\t4\t6\t8\t10\t12\t0\t 0.2\t 0.4\t 0.6\t 0.8\t 1\t 1.2\t 1.4\t 1.6\tDeflaon\tRate\t(in\t%)\tFigure\t2.\tHousehold\tSavings\tand\tDeflaon\tRate:\tJapan\tHousehold\tsavings/GDP\t Source: World Economic Outlook  Database, IMF. This chart plots the deflation  rates and savings ratios for Japan for all years  with negative inflation rates  since 1980 \u2013 1995, 1999, 2000 -2005, 2009 -2014 .  Finally, it is true that deflation increases the real burden of existing debt, thus exacerbating debt overhang. But this is true of any unanticipated disinflation, and is not specific to deflation. If debt i s excessive, a targeted restructuring is better than inflating it away across the board.  Regardless  of all these arguments , the spectre of deflation haunts central bankers . When coupled with the other political concerns raised by slow and unequal growth li sted above, it is no wonder that the authorities in developed countries do not want to settle for low growth, even if that is indeed their economy\u2019s potential.  So the central dilemma in industrial economies has been how to reconcile the political imperativ e for strong growth with the reality that cyclical stimulus measures have proved ineffective in restoring high growth, debt write -offs are politically unacceptable, and structural reforms have the wrong timing, politically speaking, of pain versus gain. There is, however, one other channel for growth \u2013 exports.  Emerging Market Response  If industrial countries are stuck in low growth, can emerging markets (I use the term broadly to also stand for developing or frontier markets) take up the global slack in de mand? After all, emerging markets have a clear need for infrastructure investment, as well as growing 7   populations that can be a source of final demand. Why cannot industrial countries export to emerging markets  as a way to bolster growth?  After all, they h ave done so in the past.  Emerging markets have no less of an imperative for growth than industrial countries. While many do not have past entitlement promises to deliver on, some have ageing populations that have to be provided for, and many have young, po or, populations with sky -high expectations of growth. Ideally, emerging markets would invest for the future, funded by the rich world, thus bolstering aggregate world demand .   The 1990s were indeed a period when emerging markets borrowed from the rest of the world in attempting to finance infrastructure and development. It did not end well, with credit booms, large unviable prestige projects, and eventual busts. The Mexican Crisis of 1994, the Asian  Crisis of 1997 -98, and the Argentinian Crisis of 2001 hig hlighted the inability of emerging markets to manage large increases in domestic investment funded by foreign capital inflows. The lesson from the 1990s crises was that emerging market reliance on foreign capital for growth was dangerous . With investment  prudently  limited to domestic savings, this naturally curtailed  their ability to serve as growth engines for the world.     -2\t-1\t0\t1\t2\t3\t4\t5\t6\t1995\t1996\t1997\t1998\t1999\t2000\t2001\t2002\t2003\t2004\t2005\t2006\t2007\t2008\t2009\t2010\t2011\t2012\t2013\t2014\t%\tof\tGDP\tCurrent\tAccount\tBalance\t(as\t%\tof\tGDP)\tAdvanced\t Emerging\t1997\t2006\t2014\t Source: World Economic Outlook Database, April 2015. Emerging economies include \u201cemerging and developing\u201d countries.  Following the  1990s crises, as the dotted line in Figure 3 indicates, a  number of emerging markets went further to run current account surpluses after cutting investment  sharply , and started accumulating foreign exchange reserves to preserve exchange competitiveness. Rather than generating excess demand for the world\u2019s goods, they became suppliers (or equivalently, savers), searching for demand elsewhere. And the debt -fuelled demand from the industrial Figure 3:  8   countries before the Global Financial Crisis , as indicated by their current account deficits,  spilled over into a demand for emerging market goods. The years before the crisis were years of plenty for countries like China that catered directly to industrial country demand, and countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America that sold commodities and intermediate goods to the direct suppliers.  In 2005, Ben Bernanke, then a governor at the Federal Reserve, coined the term \u201cGlobal Savings Glut\u201d to describe the current account surpluses, especially of emerging markets, that were finding their way into the United States.10 He argued that these depressed U.S. interest rates, enhancing consumption, and the U.S. current account deficit. Bernanke pointed to a number of adverse consequences to the United States from these flows including  the misallocation of resources to non -traded goods like housing away from tradable manufacturing. He suggested that it would be good if United States \u2019 current account deficit shrank, but that primarily required emerging markets to reduce their exchange ra te intervention rather than actions on the part of the United States.  So pre -global financial crisis, emerging markets and industrial countries were locked in a dangerous relationship of capital flows and demand that reversed the equally dangerous pattern  before the emerging market crises in the late 1990s. Sustained exchange rate intervention by emerging market central banks, as well as an excessive tolerance for leverage in industrial countries contributed to the eventual global disaster. But post -financ ial crisis, the pattern is reversing  once again.  Post global financial crisis , much like the emerging markets in the early 2000s, industrial countries have curtailed their investment without increasing their consumption (as a fraction of GDP), thus reduci ng their demand for foreign goods and their reliance on foreign finance. Indeed, as the solid line in Figure 3 indicates, advanced economies ran current account surpluses in 2013 and were also projected to do so in 2014, a shift in current account balances  of about 1.5 percentage points of GDP since 2008.    The counterpart of this shift of advanced economies from current account deficit (demand creating) to surplus (supply creating) has been a substantial fall in current account surpluses in emerging market s over the same period. This relative increase in demand for foreign goods from emerging markets has come about through a ramp up in investment from 2008, rather than a fall in savings \u2013 a shift of 2.7 percentage points of GDP in current account balances between 2008 and 2014. Facilitating or causing this shift has been a broad appreciation of real effective exchange rates in emerging markets and a depreciation in industrial country rates between 2006 -2014.                                                                 10 \u201cThe Global Saving G lut and the U.S. Current Account Deficit\u201d, remarks by Governor Bernanke at the Sandridge Lecture, Virginia Association of Economists, Richmond, Virginia  on  March 10, 2005, http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/200503102/  Figure 4 : Real Effective Exchange Rate Movements 2006-2014      Source. IMF   Have industrial country central banks  policies , similar to the sustained exchange rate intervention by emerging market central banks in the early 2000s , accelerated this current account adjustment? Possibly, and likely candidates would be what are broadly called unconventional monetary policies (UMP) . Unconventional Monetary Policy Unconventional monetary policies  include both policies where the central bank  attempts to commit to hold interest rates at near zero for long, as well as policies that affect central bank balance sheets such as buying assets in certain markets, including exchange markets, in order  to affect market  prices.11   There clearly is a role for unconventional policies \u2013 when markets are broken or grossly dysfunctional, central banke rs may step in with their balance sheets to mend markets . The key question is what happens when these policies are prolonged long beyond repairing markets  to actually distorting them. The benefit to cost ratio there is less clear.  Take, for instan ce, the zero -lower -bound problem. Because short term policy rates cannot be pushed much below zero, and because long rates tack on a risk premium to short rates, central banks may use UMP to directly affect long rates. Direct action by a risk tolerant cen tral bank , such as purchasing long bonds, effectively shrinks the risk premium available on remaining long assets.12  This has two effects. First, those who can rebalance between short and long assets now prefer holding short term assets because, risk adjust ed, these are a better deal. Thus as the central bank increases bond purchases under quantitative easing , the willingness  of commercial banks to hold unremunerated reserves r ather than long term assets  increases. Second, those institutions that cannot shif t to short term assets , such as pension funds, bond mutual funds, and insurance companies , will either continue holding their assets and suffer a relative under -compensation for risk, or turn to riskier assets . This behaviour, also termed the search for yield, will occur if  the relative under -compensation for risk in more exotic  assets is lower , or 11 For an excellent overview, see Claudio Borio and P. Disyatat, \"Unconventional monetary policies: An appraisal \", The Manchester School; Vol. 78 , Issue s1, pp. 53 -89, September 2010  12 For instance, because the most risk averse holders of existing long bonds sell first and move to holding short term assets.  9                                                              10   simply because institutions  have to meet a fixed nominal rate of return constraint on their portfolios. Of course, such portfolio rebalan cing wil l also take place  because the central bank buys long duration bonds out of institutional  portfolios, leaving them cash to redeploy.  None of this need be a problem if everyone knows w hen to stop. Unfortunately , there are few constraints on central banks und ertaking these policies since they are self -financing (commercial banks become more willing to hold central bank reserves  as the risk premium on long bonds shrinks ). If the po licy does not seem to be increasing growth , one can simply do more. All the while , the distortion  in asset prices and the mis-allocation of funds can increase, which can be very costly when the central bank decides to exit.  Equally important though , is that domestic fund managers can search for yield abroad , depreciating the sending c ountry\u2019s currency and causing the receiving country\u2019s currency to appreciate , perhaps significantly more so than ordinary monetary policy . This may indeed cause the increase in domestic competitiveness that could energize the sending country\u2019s exports.  But such increases in competitiveness  and \u201cdemand shifting\u201d can be very detrimental for global stability,  especially if unaccompanied by domestic demand creation.     Spill Overs to Emerging Markets  and Musical Crises  If UMP enhances financial risk taking in the originating country without enhancing domestic investment or consumption, the exchange rate impact of UMP may simply shift demand away from countries not engaging in UMP, without creating much compensating domestic demand  for their goods . If so, UMP wo uld resemble very much the exchange rate intervention policies of the emerging markets pre -global financial crisis.   Indeed, the post -global crisis capit al flows into emerging markets have been huge, despite the best efforts of emerging markets to push the m back by accumulating reserves  (net capital flows to emerging economies reached US$ 550 bn in 2013 compared to US$120 bn in 2006) .13 14 These flows have increase d local leverage , not just due to the direct effect of cross -border banking flows but also the i ndirect effect, as the appreciating exchange rate and rising asset prices, especially of  real estate, make it seem that emerging market borrowers have more equity than they really have. Bernanke\u2019s  concerns in 2005 about mal -investment  in the United State s resulting from capital i nflows from emerging markets have surfaced  in emerging markets post -crisis  as a result of capital inflows from industrial countries.   Have  crises in emerging markets in the 1990s been transformed into crises in industrial countries  in the 2000s  and once again into vulnerabilities in emerging markets  in the 2010s , as countries react to the problem of inadequate global demand by exporting their problems to other countries? The \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d in July 201 3 certainly seemed to suggest t hat emerging markets that ran large current account deficits were vulnerable once again .15  Is the world                                                             13 Based on the World Economic Outlook database. Emerging economies include \u201cemerging and developing\u201d countries. Net capital flows include net direct investment, net protfolio investment, and \u201cother\u201d net investment.  14 Inde ed, similar to the behavior of commercial banks, the willingness of emerging market central banks to hold short term paper in response to capital inflows enhances the ability of the industrial country central bank to engage in further UMP. In a sense, emer ging market central banks provide liquidity for foreign investors by holding precautionary reserves.    15 For those who advocate allowing exchange rate adjustment as central to macro -management, it should be sobering that countries that allowed the real ex change rate to appreciate the most during the prior period of quantitative easing suffered the greatest adverse  impact to financial conditions (see Eichengreen, Barry and Poonam Gupta (2013), \u201cTapering Talk: The Impact of Expectations of Reduced Federal 11   engaged in a macabr e game of musical crises  as each country attempts to boost growth ? If possibly yes, as suggested by the previous discussion, how do w e break this cycle?  Good Policies\u2026and Good Behaviour  In an ideal world, the political imperative for growth would not outstrip the economy\u2019s potential. Given that we do not live in such a world, and given that social security commitments, over -indebtedness , and poverty are not going to disappear , it is probably wiser to look for ways to enhance sustainable growth.  Clearly, the long run response to weak global growth should be  policies that promote innovation as well as  structural reforms that enhanc e effic iency. Given that growth within countries is poorly distributed, policies that improve the domestic distribution of capabilities and opportunities without significantly dampening incentives for innovation and efficiency are also needed.  In the short run t hough, the need for sensible investment is paramount. In industrial countries, green energy initiatives  such as carbon taxes or emission limits, while giving industry clear signals on where to invest,  also have the ability to move the needle  on aggregate i nvestment and help long run goals on environment protection.  Most emerging markets have large infrastructure investment needs. We still need to understand how to improve project selection and finance  \u2013 too much public sector involvement results in sloth a nd rent seeking, too much private sector involvement leads to risk intolerance and profiteering.  Going forward, well -designed public  private partnerships , drawing on successful experiences elsewhere, should complement private initiative .  The Australian P residency of  the G 20  created a welcome mechanism to share be st investment practices  across countries. At the same time, we must recognize that large scale investment projects need patient risk capital, which is in short supply in emerging markets. Private  investors rarely have the risk tolerance that governments or multilateral institutions have. So, in addition to knowledge sharing, global growth would benefit from an augmentation of the capital base of multilateral institutions like the World Bank, the A frican Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank, so that they can provide part of the patient risk tolerant capital the emerging world needs.  Despite competing domestic demands, industrial countries should recognize the important catalytic role tha t the development banks can play and help bolster their capital . At the very least, they should not stand in the way of others augmenting capital and taking more ownership.  Clearly, s ensible investment has a much better chance of paying dividends when macroeconomic policies are sound. And such policies are easier when the adverse spill overs from cross -border capital flows are limited.  This may require new rules of the game for policy making.  New Rules of the Game?  How do we focus on domestic demand creat ion and avoid this game of musical crises  with countries trying to depreciate their exchange rate through sustained direct exchange rate                                                                                                                                                                                          Reserve Security Purchases on Emerging Markets\u201d, Working Paper, Uni versity of California, Berkeley and Mishra, Prachi, Kenji Moriyama, Papa N\u2019Diaye and Lam Nguyen (2014), \u201cThe Impact of Fed Tapering Announcements on Emerging Markets\u201d, IMF working paper ). 12   intervention or through unconventional monetary policies  (where demand creating transmission channels are blocked) ?16 It might be useful to examine and challenge the  rationales used to justify such actions.  Rationale 1 : Would the world not be better off if we grew strongly?  Undoubtedly, if there were no negative spill overs from a country\u2019s actions, the world would indeed  be better off if the country grew. But the whole poi nt about policies that primarily affect domestic growth by depreciating the domestic exchange rate is that they work by pulling growth from others, not creating growth for others.   Rationale 2: We are in  a deep recession. We need to use any means available to jump start growth. Once we get out of recession, the payoff for other countries from our growth will be considerable.  This may be a legitimate rationale if the  policy is a \u201cone -off\u201d and once the coun try gets out of its growth funk, it is willing to let its currency app reciate so that it absorbs imports , thus pulling other countries with it. But if the strengthening currency leads to a continuation of the unconventional policies as the country\u2019s author ities become unwilling to give back the growth they obtained by undervaluing their currency, or if the strengthening currency leads to greater domestic political clamour about foreign countries undervaluing their currencies, this rationale is suspect.  More over, policies that encourage  sustained unidirectional capital outflows to other countries can be very debilitating for the recipient\u2019s financial stability, over and above any effects on their competitiveness. Thus any \u201cone -off\u201d has to be limited in durati on. Rationale 3:  Our domestic mandate requires us to do what it takes to fulfil our inflation objective, and unconventional monetary policy is indeed necessary when we hit against the zero lower bound.  This rationale has two weaknesses.  First, it places  a domestic mandate above an international responsibility. If this were seen to be legitimate, then no country would ever respect international responsibilities when inconvenient. Second, it implicitly assumes that the only way to achieve the inflation man date is through unconventional monetary policy  (even assuming UMPs are successful in elevating inflation on a sustained basis, for which there is little evidence) .  Rationale 4 : We take into account the feedback effects to our economy from the rest of the world while setting policy. Therefore, we are not oblivious to the consequences of unconventional monetary policies on other countries.  Ideally, responsible global citizenship would require a country to act as it would act in a world without boundaries. In  such a world, a policy maker should judge whether the overall positive domestic and international benefits of a policy , discounted over time , outweigh its costs. Some policies may have largely domestic benefits and foreign costs, but they may be reasonabl e in a world without boundaries because more people are benefited than are hurt.                                                              16 See also a very thoughtful piece by Fabrizio Saccomanni , \u201cMonetary spillovers? Boom and bust? Currency wars? \u201d, The international monetary system strikes back \u201d, BIS Special Governors Meeting, Manila, February 2015.    13   By this definition, Rationale 4 does  not necessarily amount to responsible global citizenship because a country only takes into account the global \u201cspillbacks\u201d to itself from  any policies it undertakes, instead of the spill overs also. So, for example, Country A may destroy industry I in country B  through its policies, but will only take into accou nt the spillback from industry I  purchasing less of country A\u2019s exports.    Rationale 5 : Monetary policy with a domestic focus is already very complicated and hard to communicate. It would be impossibly complex if we were additionally burdened with having to think about the effects of (unconventional) monetary policies o n other countr ies. This widely -heard rationale is really an abandonment of responsibility. It amounts to asserting that the monetary authority only has a domestic mandate, which is Rationale 3 above. In an interconnected  globalized world, \u201ccomplexity\u201d  cannot be a defens e.  Rationale 6: We will do what we must, y ou can adj ust. Adjustments are never easy, and sometimes very costly  \u2013 one reason why Ben Bernanke placed the burden of change in his \u201cSavings Glut\u201d speech outside the United States . Emerging markets may not have the institutions that can weather the  exchange rate volatility  and credit growth associated with large capital flows  \u2013 for instance, sharp exchange rate depreciation s can translate quickly into inflation  if the emerging market central bank does not have cr edibility , while exchange rate depreciations may be more easily endured by an industrial country.    The bottom line is that multilateral institutions like the IMF should re -examine the \u201crules of the game\u201d for responsible policy , and develop a consensus ar ound new ones . No matter what a central bank \u2019s domestic mandate, international responsibilities should not be ignored. The IMF should analyze each new unconventional monetary policy (including sustained unidirectional exchange rate intervention), and based  on their effects and the agreed rules of the game, d eclare them in - or out -of-bounds. By halting policies that primarily work through the exchange rate, it will also contribute to solving a classic Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma problem associated with policies that depreciate the exchange rate -- once some countries undertake these polic ies, staying out is difficult (the country that eschews these policies sees its currency appreciate and demand fall) . Exit is also difficult (the exiting count ry faces sharp appreciat ion). Therefore,  in the absence of collective action, these policies will be undertaken even when sub -optimal, and will carry on too long.    Of cou rse, with country authorities in almost every industrial country focused on appeasing populist anti -trade an ti-finance (and anti -central bank) political movements, there is little appetite for taking on further international commitments. We clearly need further dialogue and public debate on the issues that have been raised, while recognizing that progress will require strong political leadership.     International Safety Nets  Emerging economies have to work to reduce vulnerabilities in their economies, to get to the point where, like Australia or Canada, they can allow exchange rate flexibility to do much of the adjustment for them to capital inflows. But the needed institutions take time to develop. In the meantime, the difficulty for emerging markets in absorbing large amounts of capital quickly and in a stable way should be seen as a constraint, much like the z ero lower bound, rather than something that can be altered quickly.  Even while resisting the te mptation of absorbing flows, emerging markets  will look to safety nets.  14   So another way to prevent  a repeat of substantial emerging market reserve accumulation , this time for precautionary rather than competitive purposes,  is to build stronger international safety nets. For instance , one possibility  is an unsolicited  liquidity line from the IMF, where countries are pre -qualified by the IMF and told (perhaps private ly) how much of a line they would qualify for under current policy \u2013 with access limits revised in the annual dialogue the Fund has with a country, and any curtailment becoming effective 6 months later. Access to the line would get activated by the IMF Boa rd in a situation of generalized liquidity shortage (as, for example, when policy tightening in source countries after an extended period of low rates causes investment managers to become risk averse).   In turn, the Fund could finance this liquidity by in termediating swaps with central banks (and thus guaranteeing central banks against default). Such proposals allow countries access to liquidity without the stigma of approaching the Fund, and without the conditionality that accompanies most Fund arrangemen ts, and thus are more likely to be acceptable as precautionary measures .  It would also be a useful exercise for the Fund, in a period of growing vulnerability to cap ital flow reversals, to determine  those countries that do not have own, bilateral, regiona l, or multilateral liquidity arrangements to fall back on, and to work to improve their access to some safety net.  Conclusion  The current non -system in international monetary policy is, in my view, a source of substantial risk, both to sustainable growth as well as to the financial sector. It is not an industrial country problem, nor an emerging market problem, it is a problem of collective action. We are being pushed towards competitive monetary easing  and musical crises .  I use Depression era terminology  because I fear that in a world with weak aggregate deman d, we may be engaged in a risky  competition for a greate r share of it. W e are thereby also creating financial sector risks for when  unconventional policies end.  We need stronger well -capitalized mul tilateral institutions with widespread legitimacy, some of which can provide patient capital and others that can monitor new rules of the game. We also need better international safety nets. And each one of us has to work hard in our own countries to devel op a consensus for free trade, open markets, and responsible global citizenry. If we can achieve all this even as recent economic events make us more parochial and inward -looking, we will truly have set the stage for the strong sustainable growth we all  desperately  need.

I am delighted to inaugurate this Newsibitio n of the Reserve Bank in this City of Joy. 2. Last year, the Reserve Bank celebrated our  Platinum Jubilee.  As part of the celebrations, we documented the 75 years of th e Reserve Bank's history in the form of a book - Mint Road Milestones. Mi lestones is rich treasure trove of ar chival material including, photographs, news clippings, documents along with a commentary which weaves them all together in an interesting narr ative. In fact, the mate rial that we collected was so interesting and rare that  we thought it would be  a great public servi ce to put it up all in the form of an exhibition and make it accessible to a much wider audience.    3. But why are we setting up the exhibition in  Kolkata? Because, Kolkata is where it all began. The Reserve Bank\u2019s firs t central office was located he re in this very building. It is thus appropriate that any effort to document the banks pa st and project its future be located here.  4. This exhibition is a part of the Bank\u2019s outreach efforts to demystify the central bank. It seeks to introduce the viewer to the broad canvas, considerations and changing facets of thought that lay behind the Bank\u2019s policy efforts over the years.  5. The display is divided into nine sections representing different phases in the Bank\u2019s evolution. These take the viewer down 75 year s of central banking history covering critical events and policies.  6. The Reserve Bank took birth here in Kolkata on April 1, 1935 as a private shareholders institution. It sh ifted to Mumbai shortly ther eafter and was nationalized in 1949. Soon after independence, the bank repositioned itself to m eet the aspirations of an infant democracy and dovetailed its functions  to the demands of a poor country with ambitious development goals.  7. The 60s were a period of instituti on building where the Reserve Bank helped formalize systems for agricultura l and industrial cred it; catalyzed institutions such as the State Finance Corporations and helped set up the Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Unit Trust of India as the first mu tual fund, the IDBI as an apex development bank , etc.   8. The 70s saw the nationalization of banks  which heralded a new era when banking was taken from the classes to the masses. This was also the period when banks performed a critical role in poverty alleviati on programmes of the government.  9. In the 80s, we started sowing th e seeds of libralisation following the recommendations of the Sukhomoy Chakraba rty Committee.  We focused on developing markets in a sequenced and calibrated manner.  10. Early in the 90s, we headed into a balan ce of payments crisis. The stabilization and structural adjustment programmes that follo wed marked an inflexion point in India\u2019s economic and financial development. Banking  sector reforms helped strengthen the banking system and made it more competitive.  11. The new millennieum brought with it a new momentum where India made a decisive break from the \u2018Hindu rate\u2019 and shif ted onto a higher growth trajectory.  This was also the period when Basel II norms were adopted, the payments system was substantially revamped, and the focus shifted to issues of inclusion.  India weathered the global financial crisis where the Reserve Banks\u2019 policy respon se and role brought it into a new public focus.  12. As we turn into the second decade of the new millennium, our endeavour is to position the RBI as a knowledge institution; cond uct outreach efforts as well as a financial literacy and inclusion drive; and finally make efforts to document the bank\u2019s history and traditions.  13. The 75 year journey of RBI gives us a g limpse of the spirit of the times and the Policy concerns of the age. We also have deli ghtful anecdotes on \u2018the note that never was\u2019 . This was a note signed by the first governor Osborne Smith. It was not issued \u2018cos Edward VII\u2019s heart had its reasons. The King\u2019 s abdication delayed the note issues of the Reserve Bank and the first RBI notes were  signed by the second governor James Taylor. 14. The exhibition also chronicles anecdotes  about the Reserve Bank\u2019s brush with art (artists and philistines) and public prudery in the commissioning of the imposing statues of the Yaksha and Yakshini on the frontage of the Bank\u2019s New Delhi office. These offended the sensibilities of many and evoking a host of parliamentary questions.  15. This exhibition tries to document events not only as they happened but also how the they were viewed by the public at large through media reports. Earlier, the RBI Monetary Museum documented the history of m oney in India and served as the focal point of the Bank\u2019s public educati on and outreach endeavours. 16. This is a concept exhibition. We hope to expand and refi ne it to showcase how the Reserve Bank contributed to economic policy formulation in the country over time.  17. As the Bank looks forward to the future, we trust that this ex hibition would be the RBI\u2019s mite to the cause of financial literacy in India. We  trust it will e voke interest and take banking and finance not only to bankers and students of economics but also to the common person.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "27 Oct 10 MP.pdf": "Frontier Issues on the Global Agenda Need for Global Cooperation1 - Duvvuri Subbarao ___________________________________________________________________   First of all, my thanks to the organi zers of this conference - ICRIER, the German Development Institute (DIE) and InWent - for inviting me to inaugurate this conference on: \u201cPolicie s for Growth and Financial Stability Beyond the Crisis - the Scope for Global Cooperation\u201d. Having just returned from a meeting of G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Gover nors in Korea over this weekend, I am deeply sensitive to the value of generating a wider debate on issues that the world has to grapple with as we emerge out of the crisis.   2. The focus of this conference on global  cooperation is part icularly relevant. Everyone now has her/his list of lessons  of the crisis, and one item common on almost every list is the lesson that today\u2019s macro economic problems cannot be resolved without global coope ration. The crisis has taught us that no country can be an island and that economic and financial di sruptions anywhere cause ripples, if not waves, everywhere. The crisis also taught us  that given the deep ening integration of countries into the global economic and fi nancial system, uncoordinated responses will lead to worse outcomes for everyone.                                                   1 Inaugural Address by Dr. Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of  India at the ICRIER/ InWent/DIE Conference on \u201cPolicies for Growth and Financial Stability Beyond the Crisis - The Scope for Global Cooperation\u201d in Mumbai on October 27, 2010.  3. When the history of this crisis is  written, the London G-20 Summit in April 2009 will be seen as a clear turning point when the leaders of the world showed extraordinary determination and unity of purpose in combating the deepest economic crisis of our generation. Sure there were differences, but they were debated and discussed and compromises we re made without eroding the end goal - that is to end the crisis.  4. The priority task today is to calibrate the exit from the crisis driven accommodative policies and put the world on a sustainable growth path. Global cooperation is as vital for managing this re covery as it was for managing the crisis. There is a growing apprehension though that  the vaunted unity that the G-20 had shown during the crisis is dissipating and that its resolve to foster globally optimal solutions is weakening.  When all the deta ils are distilled out,  two main worries emerge: first, that c ountries are not ab le to resolve their conf licts of interest, and second that at the world level we ar e bogged down by the tyranny of the present and are not able to resolv e the balance between medium  term sustainability and short term compulsions.   5. These concerns are valid, but the judgement on G-20 is perhaps harsh. The global problems we are facing today ar e complex and not amenable to easy solutions. Many of them require significan t and often painful adjustments at the national level, and in a world divided by nation-states, there is no natural constituency for the global economy. At the same time, the global crisis has shown that the global economy as an  entity is more important than ever. We cannot afford a situation where decisions essential for global prosperity become hostage to domestic concerns.   6. Against this background, and keeping in view the vast sweep of this conference theme, what I propose to do in th is inaugural address is to highlight the frontier issues on the present day globa l agenda and emphasize how we cannot resolve them without global cooperation.   Multi-speed Recovery 7. By all accounts, the world has recove red from the financial meltdown and the follow on recession much sooner than we had feared at the depth of the crisis. In its latest World Economic Outlook (W EO - October 2010), the IMF projected global growth for 2010 of 4.8 per cent; th is marks a surprising upward revision from its earlier projection of 4.6 per cent. This remarkable turnaround in outlook masks some significant geogra phical variations in the r ecovery process. Emerging market economies (EMEs), contributing near ly half of this growth, have clearly been the engine of this recovery. World trade which shrank by 11 pe r cent in 2009, is projected to expand by 11.4 per cent  in 2010, again powered by import demand of EMEs which is rising twice as fast as that of advanced economies.  8. On the other hand, in advanced economies, there are growing concerns about the slowing momentum of recover y, stubbornly high rates of unemployment and persistent output gaps. Although specifi cs vary, the G-3 - America, Europe and Japan - are caught in fierce policy debates on stimulus and exit strategies. At the heart of this debate are two issues that pit the short-term against the medium term: first, whether additional fiscal stimulus at  this stage will jeopardize medium term fiscal sustainability; and s econd, whether continued expa nsionary monetary stance - QE2 in popular jargon - will be an adequate substitute for the waning fiscal stimulus, and what implications the u ltra loose monetary policy may have for medium term inflation trends.  9. A question often asked is whether EMEs will be able to sustain global growth even if advanced economies continue to languish. People who put this question, I believe, are doing so as a rhetor ic - to encourage analytical thinking rather than to solicit an affirmative answer. Sure, multiple growth poles are a safety-net for the whole world, but to expect EMEs, by themselves, to lift global growth will be unrealis tic. Note that emerging and de veloping countries account for less than half of world GDP even when m easured at PPP valuations, and only about a third of the world trade in goods and services. Notably, the much hyped \u2018decoupling\u2019 does not stand to strict scrutiny. On the cont rary, there is evidence of powerful coupling. Recent rese arch within IMF shows that  the detrended aggregate output growth of EMEs has strong associa tion with the aggregate output growth of advanced economies and this \u2018association\u2019 has in fact increased over time, evidencing not only that the coupling is strong but  that it is getting stronger. Sure, in recent years EMEs have been less aff ected by recessions in advanced economies owing to improved policy framework and more effective macroeconomic management. But over an entire cycle, the economic prospects of EMEs remain firmly coupled with those of advanced economies.   Global Adjustments - Short  Term and Medium Term 10. All members of the G-20 are deeply conscious that purely national solutions do not solve global problems and that they ea ch need to make an adjustment to the post-crisis global realities. It is in ca librating the exit in the short-term and sequencing the structural reforms in the medium term that the differences arise, and that is where global coop eration is most vital.  11. The post-crisis global scenario has thrown up three inte rrelated issues. The first is the need for rebala ncing across and within economies. In as much as global imbalances - no matter whether they were  caused by \u2018a consumption binge\u2019 in advanced economies or a \u2018sav ings glut\u2019 in EMEs - were one of the root causes of the crisis, reducing imbalances is a ne cessary condition fo r global financial stability. A second issue is the role of exchange rates in redressing external imbalances. A third set of questions relates to capital flows into EMEs raising the familiar challenge of managing the impossibl e trinity. Let me turn to these one by one.  12. The first issue, rebalancing, is the focus of the latest (October 2010) World Economic Outlook of the IMF. I can do no be tter than to quote from the foreword to the Report.  \u201cAchieving a \u2018strong, balanced and sustained world recovery\u2019 \u2013 to quote from the goal set in Pittsburgh by the G20 \u2013 was never going to be easy. .... It requires two f undamental and difficult economic rebalancing acts.   First, internal rebala ncing: When private demand collapsed, fiscal stimulus helped alleviate the fall in output. But fiscal stimulus has to eventually give way to fiscal  consolidation, and private demand must be strong enough to take the lead and sustain growth.   Second, external rebalancing: Many advanced economies, most notably the United States, which relied excessively on domestic demand, must now rely more on net exports. Many emerging market economies, most notably China, which relied excessively on net exports, must now rely more on domestic demand.   These two rebalancing acts are taking place too slowly.\u201d  13. A prime lever for redressal of exte rnal imbalances is exchange rate flexibility, the second issue that I listed. Rebalancing wi ll require deficit economies to save more and consume less. They need to depend for growth more on external demand which calls for a r eal depreciation of their currencies. The surplus economies will need to mirror these effort s - save less and spend more, and shift from external to domestic demand. They n eed to let their cu rrencies appreciate. Managing currency tensions will require  a shared understanding on keeping exchange rates aligned to economic fundame ntals, and an agreement that currency interventions should be resorted to not as an instrument of trade policy but only to manage disruptions to macroeconomic stability.  14. That brings me to the third issue that  I listed, return of lumpy and volatile capital flows. Since capital flows have become such an em otive topic around the world in recent months, it is important perh aps to recall a few realities. First, that emerging and developing economies do need capital flows to augment their investible resources, but such flows should meet two cr iteria: they should be stable and be roughly equal to the economy\u2019s abso rptive capacity. The second reality that we must remember is that capital flows ar e triggered by both pull and push factors. The pull factors are the promising growth prospects of EMEs, their declining trend rates of inflation, capital account libera lization and improved governance. The push factors are the easy monetary policies of  advanced economies which create the capital that flows into the EMEs. What this  says is that international capital flows comprise a structural component and a cy clical component. It is the cyclical component that typically causes all the adjustment problems for EMEs. 15. That said, the multi-speed recovery around the world and the consequent differential exit from accommodative mone tary policy has triggered speculative capital flows into EMEs. The biggest problem thrown up by capital flows is currency appreciation which erodes export competitiveness. Intervention in the forex market to prevent appreciation entails costs. If the resultant liquidity is left unsterilized, it fuels inflationary pressures. If the resultant liquid ity is sterilized, it puts upward pressure on inte rest rates which, apart from hurting competitiveness, also encourages further flows.   16. Currency appreciation is not the only problem arising from the ultra loose monetary policy of advanced economies. Speculative flows on the lookout for quick returns can potentially lead to asset price build up. The assurance of advanced economies to keep interest ra tes \u2018exceptionally low\u2019 for \u2018an extended period\u2019 has also possibly triggered fina ncialization of commodities leading to a paradoxical situation of ha rdening of commodity pric es even as advanced economies continue to face demand recession. Hardening of commodity prices has affected those EMEs which are net importers of commodities.   17. Managing capital flows should not be treated as an exclusive problem of EMEs. In as much as lumpy and volatile flows are a spillover from policy choices of advanced economies, the burden of ad justment has to be shared. How this burden has to be measured and shared rais es both intellectual and practical policy challenges. The intellectual challenge is that we do not  have a good theory that explains the role of capital flows in the determination of exchange rates. We, of course, have an established theory of cu rrent account management and the role of exchange rate as a variable in that. What we now need is a theory that encompasses both current and capital accounts and one that  gives a better unders tanding of what capital controls work and in what situa tions. That is the intellectual challenge. What is the practical challe nge? The practical challenge is  that once we have such a theory, we need to reach a shared understa nding on two specific as pects: first, to what extent are advanced economies res ponsible for the cross border spill over impact of their domestic polic ies, and second, what is the framework of rules that should govern currency interventions in the face of volatile capital flows.    Protectionism 18. In the post-crisis world, there may not  actually be \u2018deglobalization\u2019 but the earlier orthodoxy that globalization is an  unmixed blessing is being increasingly challenged. The rationale behind globalizati on was, and hopefully is, that even as advanced countries may see some low end jobs being outsourced, they will still benefit from globalization because for ev ery low end job gone, another high end job - that is more skill intensive, more productive - will be created. If this does not happen rapidly enough or vi sibly enough, protectionist pr essures will arise, and rapidly become vociferous and politica lly compelling. The efforts of several countries around the world to resist curren cy appreciation are a manifestation of protectionist pressures. 19. There is concern in some quarters th at while open protectionism has been resisted relatively well during the current crisis, opaque protectionism has been on the rise. Opaque protectionism takes the form  of resorting to measures such as anti-dumping actions, safeguards, preferential treatment of domestic firms in bailout packages and discriminatory procurem ent practices. Experience shows that countries resort to restrictive trade pr actices in areas not covered by multilateral rules or by exploiting the lack of specificity in certain rules. To strengthen multilateral trade discipline, the need for a quick conclusion of the Doha Round can hardly be overemphasized. In a world with  growing worries about the debt creating stimulus packages, a Doha Round agreement should be welcomed as a non-debt creating stimulus to the global economy.   International Monetary System 20. The global crisis has re vived the familiar concerns about the robustness of the international monetary system. The system  we now have is th at the US dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency by virtue of the dominant size of  the US economy, its share in global trade, the preponderant use of dollar in  foreign trade and foreign exchange transactions and a host of other intangible factors. The US has met the obligation of an issuer of reserve currency by running fiscal and external deficits while enjoying the comfort of not having to make the necessary adjustment to bridge the deficits. Such persistent defic its of a dominant economy can potentially create imbalances at the global level as indeed happened in the build up to the crisis. While the US took care of the suppl y side of the reserves, the demand side impetus comes from several factors including the accumulation of reserve assets by EMEs as a measure of self-insurance against external shocks. 21.  The problem with the world having only a single reserve currency came to the fore during the crisis as many countri es faced dollar liquidity problems as a consequence of swift deleveraging by fo reign creditors and foreign investors. Paradoxically, even as the US economy was in a downturn, the dollar strengthened as a result of flight to safety.  22.  Based on the experience of the crisis, several reform proposals have been put forward to address the problems arisi ng from a single reserve currency. One is to have a menu of alternative reserve curre ncies. But this cannot  happen by fiat. An alternative currency or currencies will take root as reserve curr ency/currencies only if those currencies are fully convertible and acquire a dominant share in world trade. A second option is to develop the SDR as a reserve currency. This does not seem to be a feasible option. For the SDR to  be a genuine reserve currency, it has to fulfil several conditions: the SDR has to be accepted as a liability of the IMF, has to be automatically acceptable as a medium of payment in cross- border transactions, be freely tradeable and its price has to be determined by forces of demand and supply. A third suggested solution aims at reducing the need for self-insurance and thereby the dependence on a reserve curre ncy by supporting a multilateral option of a prearranged line of credit that can be easily and quickly accessed. Such a multilateral option is necessary as a complement to self-insurance but it cannot be a substitute; some measure of self-insuran ce will continue to be the first line of defence. 23.  None of the above solutions as you  can see fully addresses the problems arising from a single global reserve currenc y. What this underscores is that at the global level we need to explore these an d other options for protecting ourselves from the vulnerabilities that we confr ont as a consequence of a single reserve currency.  Governance of Bretton Woods Institutions 24. The global crisis has underscored the importance of reforming the governance structures of Bretton Woods inst itutions - the IMF and the World Bank, so as to give representation to EMEs co mmensurate with their growing share in the global economy. These reforms are central to the legitimacy and effectiveness of these global institutions. There has been significant progress in respect of World Bank capital and voice reforms.  Quota reform in the IMF is also expected to be completed soon. Countries which have not  been traditional creditors, including India, have entered into sizeable credit arrangeme nts with the Fund.  This strengthens the case for quota sh ifts in their favour as a group, and in particular to dynamic EMDCs, to better reflect current gl obal economic reali ties. These shifts need to be followed up by continuing th e dynamic process aime d at enhancing the voice and representation of the poorest th rough a comprehensive review of the quota formula by July 2013. Here the need for cooperation among countries will be crucial.   Financial Sector Reforms 25. In September 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) put out a comprehensive pape r indicating the broad agreem ent reached on the Basel III proposals. Broadly, these reforms will require banks to hold more and better quality capital and to carry more liquid as sets, will limit their leverage and mandate them to build up capital buffers in good tim es that can be draw n down in periods of stress.  The Basel III process is not yet complete.  Some aspects of Basel III, such as common equity and tier I capital have b een firmed up; others such as the new global liquidity standards and the leverage ra tio have yet to be precisely specified. This will be done after a further assessment of the reasonableness of these measures and their impact on banks\u2019 balance sheets as well as the national economies. Though this would allow time for further cal ibration and refinement, it could on the other hand contribute to re gulatory uncertainty. Moreover, there are several issues such as capital conservation buffer and c ountercyclical buffer which are fraught with severe definitional and implemen tation complexities and challenges. 26. Another crisis driven in itiative has been to expand the erstwhile Financial Stability Forum into a Financial Stability Board (FSB) by giving representation to EMEs. The FSB has been working on a numb er of initiatives including managing the moral hazard associated with system ically important financial institutions (SIFIs) through more stringen t regulatory and supervisory norms, principles to guide compensation of bank managements, a single set of accounting standards and regulation of OTC derivatives, credit rati ng agencies and hedge funds. There are also several areas where s ubstantial work needs to be done including in improving resolution regimes for cross-border ba nks and systemically important nonbank financial companies, addressing the proc yclicality of the financial system, and macro-prudential surveillance. More work also needs to be done to extend the prudential norms on the lines of  Basel III to the shadow financial system which lay at the heart of the recent financial crisis. 27. Within a common set of agreed-upon global standards, each jurisdiction may have to tailor some of its rules and supervisory practices to national conditions and preferences. The big challenge going forward will be to implement global standards with national diffe rentiation but without giving any scope for the market to interpret national deviations from th e standards as regulatory looseness.  Conclusion 28. Let me now summarize. In my remark s today, I covered what I believe are the frontier issues on the present day global agenda. In particular, I gave a picture of the multi-speed recovery and its implications for global adjustments in the short term and in the medium term. These adjustments need to cover three inter-related issues: redressing imbalances, exchange rate  flexibility and management of capital flows. I emphasized how global cooperation is vital to reach a shared understanding on all the three issues. I then raised the po ssibility of a post cris is world which will be less welcoming of globalization and how this may trigger protectionist pressures. I moved on to emphasize how global cooperation is vital for reforming the international monetary system and the need for a comprehensive quota and representation reform in the Bretton W oods Institutions commensurate with the growing contribution of EMEs to global growth and global trade. Finally, I gave a brief status of the reforms in the financia l sector, and how agai n restoring financial stability at the national and international levels requires global cooperation.   29. The common thread running through all th e issues that I ra ised is the need for global cooperation in solving our most  pressing problems of today. Given the strength and pace of globalization, purely national solutions are not only inadequate but may indeed be counterproductive.  30. I realise I have raised se veral issues without provid ing complete solutions. I believe that is the privileg e of the inaugural speaker.  The burden of identifying solutions and debating their pros and cons belongs to the conference proper.  31. The global crisis has taken a devastati ng toll on global grow th and welfare.  In their painstakin gly researched book, \u2018 This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly \u2019, Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart show how over eight hundred years, all financial crises can be traced to the same fundamental causes as if we learnt nothing from one crisis to the next. Each time, experts have chimed that \u2018this time is different\u2019 claiming that the old rules do not apply and the new situation is dissimilar to the previous one. It will be too costly for the world not to heed this lesson. We should cooperate not only to fi rmly exit from the crisis, but also to ensure that in resolving this crisis, we  do not sow the seeds of the next crisis. ", "16 July 21 MP.pdf": "Interview w ith Financial Express on Friday , July 16, 2021 -  Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor, Reserve Bank of India   It is not like any other year, when inflation goes up, you start tightening the monetary policy: RBI Governor Shaktikanta  Das Over the last few months, the government has taken steps to address the price rise in pulses, edible oils as also the imported inflation, but we do expect more measures from both the Centre and states to soften the pace of inflation.

Governor  Shaktikanta Das expounds  on the current  priorities  of the central  bank,  which  is also the governm ent\u2019s  debt manager,  in an exclusive  interview  with Shobhana Subramanian and KG Narendranath.    Excerpts:   Is the latest  retail  inflation  number  (6.26%  in June,  upon a high  base  of 6.23%)  a cause  for worry  or has it come  as a relief  (given  it eased  a tad from a six-month high of 6.3%  in May)?  How  long will the RBI be able to retain  the growth -supportive  bias in the conduct  of monetary  policy?   The CPI inflation  number  for June  is on expected lines.  The year-on-year growth  in \u2018core\u2019  inflation (eased marginall y to 6.17%  in June  compared with 6.34%  in May.  The momentum  of the CPI inflation  has come  down  significantly  in the both headline and core inflation  in June.   The current  inflation  is largely  influenced by supply -side factors.  High international  commodity  prices,  rising  shipping  charges  and elevated pump prices  of diesel  and petrol  (which  are partly  due to high taxes)  are putting  pressure on input  prices.  Prices  of several  food items  including  meat,  egg, fish, pulses,  edible oils, non-alcoholic  beverages  have  risen  too.  Supply -chain constraints  have  also arisen out of the Covid  19 related restrictions  on movement  of goods,  and these are easing  slowly.  Over  the last few months,  the government  has taken  steps  to address  the price  rise in pulses,  edible  oils as also the imported  inflation,  but we do expect  more  measures  from both the Centre  and states  to soften  the pace  of inflation.   Last year,  in July and August,  CPI inflation  was in excess of 6%; in September  and October, it was in excess of 7% and in November,  almost  7%. That was the time when  the Monetary  Policy  Committee  (MPC) had assessed  that the spike  in inflation  was transitory  and it would come  down  going  forward.  In hindsight,  the MPC\u2019s  assessment  was absolutely  correct.  Now,  the MPC  has assessed  that inflation  will moderate in Q3FY22,  so I emphasise  on the need to avoid any hasty  action.  Any hurried action,  especially  in the background of the current  spike  in inflation  being  transitory,  could  completely  undo the economic  recovery,  which  is nascent  and hesitant,  and create  avoidable disruptions  in the financial  markets.   At 9.5%  (real GDP)  growth  projected by us for FY22,  the size of the economy  would just about  be exceeding  the pre-pandemic  (2019- 20) level.  Given  that growth  is still fragile,  the highest priority  needs  to be given  to it at this juncture.   We need  to be very watchful  and cautious  before  doing  anything  on the monetary  policy  front.  Also,  all this we have to see in the context  of the truly extraordinary  situation that we are in, due to the pandemic.  It is not like any other  year or occasion,  when inflation goes  up, you start tightening  the monetary  policy.   The Centre\u2019s  fiscal  deficit  is high (the budget  gap more  than  doubled to 9.3%  of GDP  in FY21  and is projected  to be 6.8%  this year),  but given  the huge  revenue  shortfall,  the size of the fiscal  stimulus  is limited  and not adequate  to push growth.  Yet, the RBI needs  to focus  a lot on the yield  curve  to ensure  that the government\u2019s  borrowing  cost doesn\u2019t  skyrocket.  Some  would  say the RBI\u2019s debt  management  function is taking  precedence over  its core  function,  which is inflation -targeting.  Is the RBI open to creating  new money  to directly  finance  the fiscal  deficit?   I would not agree with the formulation that debt management  is undermining  inflation -targeting.  In fact, our debt management  operations  throughout  the past year and more  has ensured better  transmission  of monetary  policy  decisions.  We are using  the instruments  at our command  to ensure transmission  of rates.  Thanks  to our debt management  operations,  the interest  rates  on government  borrowings  in 2020- 21 were  the lowest  in 16 years,  and private- sector  borrowing  costs have also substantially  reduced.  If the real estate  and construction  sectors are out of the woods  now,  the all-time low interest  rates  on housing  loans  have  had a big role in it.  We have  not only reduced interest  rates  in consonance  with monetary  policy,  but have also ensured  availability  of adequate  \u2013 even  surplus \u2013 liquidity  in the system  through OMO, Operation Twist  and GSAPs.  These  have  resulted in lower  borrowing  costs and financial  stability  across the entire gamut  of stakeholders  including  banks,  NBFCs  and MFIs,  and, therefore,  been very supportive to economic  growth.   If you look at the M3, the growth  of money  is just about  in the range of 9-10%,  meaning  our accommodative stance  is not really  creating  high inflation.   As far direct  financing  of the government\u2019s  fiscal  deficit  is concerned,  this apparently  easy  option is out of sync with the economic  reforms  being  undertaken;  it is also in conflict  with the FRBM  law. In fact, this option has several  downsides  and the RBI has refrained  from it.  What\u2019s  important  is the (high)  efficiency  with which  the RBI is meeting  the borrowing  requirement  of the government.  The Centre and states,  among  themselves,  borrowed  about  \u20b921-22 lakh crore,  a record  high amount  in FY21,  but at historical -low interest  rates.  In the current  year too, there could be a borrowing  quantum  of the same  order,  and the RBI will use all the tools  at its disposal  to ensure that the borrowings  are non-disruptive and at low interest  rates.   There  is ample  liquidity  in the system,  yet the banks  appear  to be extremely  risk-averse.  They  would rather  park  the excess  funds  under  the reverse  repo window,  than  lend to the industry.  Even  the government\u2019s  schemes like ECGLS  \u2013 which  insulates  banks  from  credit  risk on loans  to MSMEs  and retail  borrowers  \u2013 and the targeted  liquidity  policy  of RBI for small  NBFCs  don\u2019t  seem  to change  the outlook  much.  As the regulator,  how do you get this fear psychosis  out of banks?   The banks  have  to do prudent  lending  with proper  appraisals.  Risk aversion on the part of the banks  is arising  from the current  pandemic  situation,  and its possible  consequences.  Demand  for credit  from the industry  is also not as high as one would expect  it to be. This is because  there  is still a large  output  gap that constrains  new investments.   Many  large  companies  considerably  deleveraged their bank  loans  in FY21,  while  raising  money  from the corporate  bond market.  So banks  have  to lend where there  is a demand,  and that is one reason  why lending  to retail  sector  is growing.  There  is no gainsaying  that bank  credit  needs  to rise; I\u2019m sure banks  will indeed lend if there is demand for credit  and the projects  are viable.   There  is a lot of demand  for loans  from companies  that are relatively  low-rated.  Banks  are not willing  to take any risk\u2026   Of course,  the risk perception (among  lenders)  is high and, precisely  for that reason,  the government  unveiled the ECLGS  scheme  (under  which  guaranteed loans  up to a limit of \u20b94.5 lakh crore  will be extended).  If you see our TLTRO  scheme  or the refinancing  support  (special  facilities  for \u20b975,000  crore  were  provided last year to all India financial  institutions,  including  Nabard and SIDBI; a fresh  support  of \u20b950,000  crore  has been  provided for new lending  in FY22),  the objective is that they would lend to small  and micro  businesses.  We have also given  \u20b910,000 crore  to small  finance  banks  and MFIs  at the repo rate (4%),  again to ensure adequate  fund flow to micro  and small  firms.   As for the healthcare  sector,  banks  are allowed to park their surplus  liquidity  up equivalent  of the size of their Covid  loan books  with the RBI at a higher  rate. We are also according  priority -sector  status  to certain loans  for the healthcare sector.  So, because of the extraordinary  situation,  we are incentivising  the banks  to lend more  through  a series  of measures.   As the regulator,  our job is to provide an ecosystem  where the banking  sector  functio ns in a very robust  manner.  But beyond that, who the banks  will lend to or won\u2019t  lend to must  be based on their own risk assessment,  and the prudential  norms.   In the recent  financial  stability  report  (FSR),  the worst -case  NPA scenario  after the full withdrawal  of forbearance is foreseen to be better  than the best case  perceived in the January  edition\u2026   We had a much  clearer  view of the assent  quality  in the July FSR than when the January  edition  was drafted,  when the regulatory  forbearance partially  blurred  the picture.  Still, these are assumptions  and analytical  exercises  rather  than projections.  These could  serve  as guidance  to the banks  in their internal  analysis  of, say, a possible severe stress  scenario.  We expect  the banks  could  use these  inputs  to take proactive,  pre-emptive  measures  on two fronts  specifically:  increasing  the provision coverage ratio and mobilsing  additional  capital  to deal with situations  of stress or a severe  stress,  should these  happen.   These  assumptions,  based on real number s, could by and large  hold true, unless  a third Covid -19 wave  plays  spoilsport.   In the auction  held on Friday,  you allowed the benchmark  yield to go up to 6.1%,  while  it had long seemed  you won\u2019t  tolerate a rate above  6%\u2026   We\u2019ve  never  had any fixation that the yield should be 6%, but some  of our actions  might  have conveyed that impression.  After  the presentation of the Budget  (for FY22)  and other  developments  such  as the enhanced government  borrowing,  the bond yields  suddenly  spiked.  The 10-year G-secs,  for example,  reached  6.26%.  But after that, through our signals  and actions  (in the form of open  market  operations,  Operations  Twist  and G-SAP,  and our actions  during  auctions,  going  sometimes  for the green- shoe  option or sometime  for cancellations,  etc) we signalled  our comfort  level to the markets.   So, we are able to bring down the yield and the rates,  by and large,  remained less than 6% till about  January  or so. The first auction  that we did last Friday  when we introduced  the new-tenure benchmark  reflecte d one important  thing  that the focus  of the central  bank  is on the orderly  evolution of the yield curve  and the market  expectations  seem  to be converging  with this approach.  So, it will be in the interest  of all stakeholders,  the economy,  if the same spirit of convergence between the market  participants  and other  stakeholders,  and the central  bank  continues  and I expect  it will continue.   A jump in the RBI\u2019s  \u2018realised  profits\u2019  from  sale of foreign exchange  enabled  you to transfer  a higher -than -expected  \u20b999,122 crore  as surplus  to the government  for the nine months  to March  31, 2021.  Are you sticking  to the economic  capital  framework  as revised  on the lines  of the Bimal  Jalan  committee\u2019s  recommendations?   One of the key recommendations  of the committee  is that unrealised gains  will not be transferred as a part of surplus  and we are strictly  following  that. We intervene in the market  to buy and sell foreign currencies,  and what  we earn out of that are realised  gains.  A large  part of the surplus  transfer  cons titutes  the exchange gains  from foreign exchange transactions.  So whatever  gains  we make  out of this are not unrealised (notional)  gains  (which  can\u2019t  be transferred  under  ECF).  We also make  losses  in such  transactions,  because RBI isn\u2019t in the game  of maki ng profit  but in the game of maintaining  stability  of the exchange rate and ensuring  broader  financial  stability.   Last year,  about  \u20b970,000 crore  had to be transferred  to the contingency  reserve  fund because it was falling  short  of the 5.5%  level recommend ed by the Jalan committee.  This was because our balance  sheet  size grew  substantially  last year due to liquidity  operations  that we undertook  in March,  April and May.  So, last year the larger  size of the RBI\u2019s  balance sheet  required that as much  as \u20b970,000 crore  be transferred to the contingency  reserve  fund.  This year,  the expansion of balance- sheet  wasn\u2019t  that much,  so the transfer  was much  less at about  \u20b925,000  crore.   ", "18 Feb 09 MP.pdf": "Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on India Collateral Damage and Response1 By Duvvuri Subbarao __________________________________________________________________   Global outlook  1. The global economic outlook deteriorated sharply over the last quarter.  In a sign of the ferocity of the down turn, the IMF made a marked downward revision of its estimate for global growth  in 2009 in purchasing power parity terms \u2013 from its forecast of 3.0 per cen t made in October 2008 to 0.5 per cent in January 2009. In market exchange rate terms, the downturn is sharper \u2013 global GDP is projected to actually shrink by 0.6 per cent. With all the advanced economies \u2013 the United States, Europe and Japan - having firmly gone into recession, the contagion of the crisis from the financial sector to the real sector has been unforgiving and total.  Recen t evidence suggests that contractionary forces are strong: demand has slumpe d, production is plunging, job losses are rising and credit markets remain in seiz ure. Most worryingly, world trade \u2013 the main channel through which the downt urn will get transmitted on the way forward \u2013 is projected to c ontract by 2.8 per cent in 2009.    2. Policy making around the world is in clearly uncharted territory.  Governments and central banks across c ountries have responded to the crisis through big, aggressive and unconventiona l measures. There is a contentious                                           1 Speech delivered at the Symposium on \"The Gl obal Economic Crisis and Challenges for the Asian Economy in a Changing World\" organized by the Institute for International Monetary Affairs, Tokyo on February 18, 2009.   2debate on whether these measures are adeq uate and appropriate,  and when, if at all, they will start to show results.  Th ere has also been a separate debate on how abandoning the rule book driven by th e tyranny of the short-term, is compromising medium-term sustainabilit y.  What is clearly beyond debate  though is that this Great Recession of  2008/09 is going to be deeper and the recovery longer than  earlier thought.     Emerging economies  3. Contrary to the 'decoupl ing theory', emerging economies too have been hit by the crisis.  The decoupling theory, which was intellectually fashionable even as late as a year ago, held that even if advanced economies went into a downturn, emerging economies will remain unscathed because of their substantial foreign exchange reserves, improved policy fram ework, robust corporate balance sheets and relatively healthy banking sector.  In a rapidly globalizing world, the 'decoupling theory' was never totally persua sive.  Given the evidence of the last few months \u2013 capital flow reversals, sh arp widening of spreads on sovereign and corporate debt and abrupt currency deprec iations - the 'decoupling theory' stands totally invalidated.  Reinforcing the noti on that in a globalized world no country can be an island, growth prospects of emerging economies have been undermined by the cascading financial crisis with, of  course, considerable variation across countries.     3Questions that will be addressed  4. India too has been impacted by the crisis \u2013 and by much more than it was suspected earlier. What I propose to do in the rest of my speech is to address the following four questions:    (i) Why has India been hit by the crisis? (ii) How has India been hit by the crisis? (iii) How have we responded to the challenge? (iv) What is the outlook for India?  Why Has India Been Hit By the Crisis?  5. There is, at least in some quarters, dismay that India has been hit by the crisis.  This dismay stems from two arguments.    6. The first argument goes as follows.  The Indian banking system has had no direct exposure to the sub-pr ime mortgage assets or to the failed institutions.  It has very limited off-balance sheet activitie s or securitized assets.  In fact, our banks continue to remain safe and healt hy.  So, the enigma is how can India be caught up in a crisis when it  has nothing much to do with  any of the maladies that are at the core of the crisis.    7. The second reason for dismay is that I ndia's recent growth has been driven predominantly by domestic consumption and domestic investment. External demand, as measured by merchandize expor ts, accounts for less than 15 per cent  4of our GDP.  The question then is, even if there is a global downturn, why should India be affected when its dependence on exte rnal demand is so limited?          8. The answer to both the above fr equently-asked qu estions lies in globalization.  Let me explain.  First, I ndia's integration into the world economy over the last decade has been remarkably rapid. Integration into the world implies more than just exports.  Going by the common measure of globalization, India's two-way trade (merchandize exports plus imports), as a proportion of GDP, grew from 21.2 per cent in 1997-98, the year of the Asian cr isis, to 34.7 per cent in 2007-08.      9. Second, India's financial integration with the world has been as deep as India's trade globalization, if not deeper . If we take an expanded measure of globalization, that is the ratio  of total external trans actions (gross current account flows plus gross capital flows) to GDP, th is ratio has more than doubled from 46.8 per cent in 1997-98 to 117.4 per cent in 2007-08.    10. Importantly, the Indian corporate se ctor's access to external funding has markedly increased in the last five years.   Some numbers will help illustrate the point. In the five-year period 2003-08, the sh are of investment in India's GDP rose by 11 percentage points. Corporate savings  financed roughly half of this, but a significant portion of the bala nce financing came from external sources. While funds were available domestically, they  were expensive relative to foreign funding. On the other hand, in a global ma rket awash with liquidity and on the promise of India's growth potential, fore ign investors were willing to take risks  5and provide funds at a lower cost.  La st year (2007/08), for example, India received capital inflows amounting to over 9 per cent of GDP as against a current account deficit in the balance of paymen ts of just 1.5 per cent of GDP. These capital flows, in excess of the current acc ount deficit, evidence the importance of external financing and the depth of  India's financial integration.    11. So, the reason India has been hit by the crisis, despite mitigating factors, is clearly India's rapid and growing in tegration into the global economy.   How Has India Been Hit By the Crisis?  12. The contagion of the crisis has spre ad to India through all the channels \u2013 the financial channel, the real channel, a nd importantly, as happe ns in all financial crises, the confidence channel.    13. Let us first look at the financial channel.  India's financial markets - equity markets, money markets, forex markets and credit markets - had all come under pressure from a number of directions.  First, as a consequence of the global liquidity squeeze, Indian banks and co rporates found their overseas financing drying up, forcing corporates to shift th eir credit demand to the domestic banking sector. Also, in their frantic search for substitute financing, corporates withdrew their investments from domestic money market mutual funds putting redemption pressure on the mutual funds and down the line on non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) where the MFs had i nvested a significant  portion of their funds. This substitution of overseas financ ing by domestic financing brought both money markets and credit markets under pressure.  Second, the forex market  6came under pressure because of reversal of capital flows as part of the global deleveraging process. Simultaneously, corporates were converting the funds raised locally into foreign currency to meet  their external obligations.  Both these factors put downward pressure on the rupee.  Third, the Reserve Bank's intervention in the forex market to manage the volatility in the rupee further added to liquidity tightening.    14. Now let me turn to the real channe l. Here, the transmission of the global cues to the domestic econo my has been quite straight  forward \u2013 through the slump in demand for exports. The United States, European Union and the Middle East, which account for three quarters of Indi a's goods and services trade are in a synchronized down turn. Service export growth  is also likely to slow in the near term as the recession deepens and financia l services firms \u2013 traditionally large users of outsourcing services \u2013 are re structured. Remittances from migrant workers too are likely to slow as the Middl e East adjusts to lower crude prices and advanced economies go into a recession.  15. Beyond the financial and real channels of transmission as above, the crisis also spread through the confid ence channel.  In sharp cont rast to global financial markets, which went into a seizure on acc ount of a crisis of confidence, Indian financial markets continued to function in  an orderly manner.  Nevertheless, the tightened global liquidity situation in  the period immediately following the Lehman failure in mid-September 2008, coming  as it did on top of a turn in the credit cycle, increased the risk aversion of the financial system and made banks cautious about lending.   7 16. The purport of the above explanation is to show how, despite not being part of the financial sector problem, Indi a has been affected by the crisis through the pernicious feedback  loops between external  shocks and domestic vulnerabilities by way of the financia l, real and confidence channels.   How Have We Responded to the Challenge?   17. Let me now turn to how we responde d to the crisis.  The failure of Lehman Brothers in mid-September was followed in quick succession by several other large financial institutions coming unde r severe stress.  This made financial markets around the world uncertain and unse ttled.  This contagion, as I explained above, spread to emerging economies, and to India too. Both the government and the Reserve Bank of India responded to the challenge in close coordination and consultation. The main plank of the gove rnment response was fiscal stimulus while the Reserve Bank's action comprised monetary accommodation and counter cyclical regulatory forbearance.   Monetary policy response    18. The Reserve Bank's policy respon se was aimed at containing the contagion from the outside - to keep the domestic money and credit markets functioning normally and see that the liqui dity stress did not  trigger solvency cascades. In particular, we targeted th ree objectives: first, to maintain a comfortable rupee liquidity position; second, to augment foreign exchange liquidity; and third, to maintain a policy framework that would keep credit  8delivery on track so as to arrest the mode ration in growth. This marked a reversal of Reserve Bank's policy stance from monetary tightening in response to heightened inflationary pressures of th e previous period to monetary easing in response to easing inflationary pressures and moderation in growth in the current cycle. Our measures to meet the above objectives came in several policy packages starting mid-September 2008, on occasion in  response to unanticipated global developments and at other times in antic ipation of the impact of potential global developments on the Indian markets.   19. Our policy packages included, like in the case of other central banks, both conventional and unconventional measures. On the conventional side, we reduced the policy interest rates aggressively a nd rapidly, reduced the quantum of bank reserves impounded by the central bank  and expanded and liberalized the refinance facilities for export credit. M easures aimed at managing forex liquidity included an upward adjustment of the inte rest rate ceiling on the foreign currency deposits by non-resident Indians, substant ially relaxing the external commercial borrowings (ECB) regime for corporates , and allowing non- banking financial companies and housing finance companies access to foreign borrowing.  20. The important among the many unconventional measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India are a rupee-dollar swap facility for Indian banks to give them comfort in managing their short-term foreign funding requirements, an exclusive refinance window as also a special purpose vehi cle for supporting non-banking financial companies, and expandi ng the lendable resources available to  9apex finance institutions for refinanci ng credit extended to small industries, housing and exports.   Government's fiscal stimulus  21. Over the last five years, both the central and state governments in India have made a serious effort to reverse the fiscal excesses of the past.  At the heart of these efforts was the Fiscal Resp onsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act which mandated a calibrated road map to fiscal sustaina bility. However, recognizing the depth and extraordinary impact of this cr isis, the central government invoked the emergency provi sions of the FRBM Act to seek relaxation from the fiscal targets and launc hed two fiscal stimulus packages in December 2008 and January 2009.  These fi scal stimulus packages, together amounting to about 3 per cent of GDP, included additional public spending, particularly capital expe nditure, government guaranteed funds for infrastructure spending, cuts in indirect taxes, expanded guarantee cove r for credit to micro and small enterprises, and additional support to exporters. These stimulus packages came on top of an already announced expanded safety-net for rural poor, a farm loan waiver package and salary increases for government staff, all of which too should stimulate demand.   Impact of monetary measures  22. Taken together, the measures put in place since mid-September 2008 have ensured that the Indian financial market s continue to function in an orderly manner. The cumulative amount of primary liquidity potentially available to the  10financial system through these measures is  over US$ 75 bln or 7 per cent of GDP. This sizeable easing has ensured a comf ortable liquidity position starting mid-November 2008 as evidenced by a number of indicators including the weighted-average call money rate, the overnight m oney market rate and the yield on the 10-year benchmark government security.  Taking the signal from the policy rate cut, many of the big banks have reduced thei r benchmark prime lending rates. Bank credit has expanded too, faster than it did last year. However, Reserve Bank\u2019s rough calculations show that the overall flow of resources to the commercial sector is less than what it was last year. This is b ecause, even though bank credit has expanded, it has not fully offset the decline in non-bank flow of resources to the commercial sector.  Evaluating the response  23. In evaluating the response to the cris is, it is important to remember that although the origins of th e crisis are common around th e world, the crisis has impacted different economies differently . Importantly, in advanced economies where it originated, the crisis spread from th e financial sector to the real sector. In emerging economies, the transmission of  external shocks to domestic vulnerabilities has typically been from the real sector  to the financial sector. Countries have accordingly responded to the crisis de pending on their specific country circumstances. Thus, even as policy responses across countries are broadly similar, their pr ecise design, quantum, sequencing and timing have varied. In particular, while policy respons es in advanced economies have had to contend with both the unfolding financial cr isis and deepening r ecession, in India,  11our response has been predom inantly driven by the need  to arrest moderation in economic growth.    What is the outlook for India?   24. The outlook for India going forward is mixed. There is evidence of economic activity slowing down. Real GDP gr owth has moderated in the first half of 2008/09. The services sector too, which has been our prime growth engine for the last five years, is  slowing, mainly in construction, transport and communication, trade, hotels and restaurant s sub-sectors. For the first time in seven years, exports have d eclined in absolute terms for three months in a row during October-December 2008. Recent data indicate that the demand for bank credit is slackening despite comfortable liq uidity in the system. Higher input costs and dampened demand have dented corporate margins while the uncertainty surrounding the crisis has affected busin ess confidence. The index of industrial production has shown negative growth fo r two recent months and investment demand is decelerating. All these factors suggest that growth moderation may be steeper and more extended than earlier projected.  25. In addressing the fall out of the cr isis, India has severa l advantages. Some of these are recent developments. Most notably, headline inflation, as measured by the wholesale price inde x, has fallen sharply, and recent trends suggest a faster-than-expected reduction in inflat ion. Clearly, falling commodity prices have been the key drivers behind the disinflati on; however, some c ontribution has also come from slowing domestic demand. Th e decline in inflation should support  12consumption demand and reduce input cost s for corporates. Furthermore, the decline in global crude prices and naphtha prices will reduce the size of subsidies to oil and fertilizer companies, opening up fiscal space for infrastructure spending. From the external sector perspec tive, it is projected that imports will shrink more than exports keeping the current account deficit modest.  26. There are also several structural fact ors that have come to India's aid. First, notwithstanding the severity and multiplicity of the adverse shocks, India's financial markets have shown admirable resilience. This is in large part because India's banking system remains sound, h ealthy, well capitali zed and prudently regulated. Second, our comfortable re serve position provides confidence to overseas investors. Third, since a large ma jority of Indians do not participate in equity and asset markets, the negative imp act of the wealth loss effect that is plaguing the advanced economies shoul d be quite muted. Consequently, consumption demand should hold up well. Fourth, because of India's mandated priority sector lending, institu tional credit for agriculture will be unaffected by the credit squeeze. The farm loan waiver package implemented by the Government should further insulate the agriculture sector from the cris is. Finally, over the years, India has built an extensive network of social safety-net programmes, including the flagship rural employm ent guarantee programme, which should protect the poor and the returning migrant workers from the extreme impact of the global crisis.    13RBI's Policy Stance   27. Going forward, the Reserve Bank's policy stance will continue to be to maintain comfortable rupee and forex liq uidity positions. There are indications that pressures on mutual funds have eased and that NBFCs too are making the necessary adjustments to balance thei r assets and liabilities. Despite the contraction in export demand, we will be  able to manage our balance of payments. It is the Reserve Bank's expectation that commercial banks will take the signal from the policy rates reduction to  adjust their depo sit and lending rates in order to keep credit flowing to produc tive sectors. In particular, the special refinance windows opened by the Reserve Bank for the MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) sector , housing sector and export se ctor should see credit flowing to these sectors. Also the SPV set up for extending assistance to NBFCs should enable NBFC lending to pick up steam once again. The government's fiscal stimulus should be able to supplement these efforts from both supply and demand sides.  When the turn around comes  28. Over the last five years, India cl ocked an unprecedented nine per cent growth, driven largely by domestic consum ption and investment even as the share of net exports has been rising. This wa s no accident or happenstance. True, the benign global environment, easy liquidity and low interest rates helped, but at the heart of India's growth were a growing en trepreneurial spirit, rise in productivity and increasing savings. These fundamental strengths continue to be in place.  14Nevertheless, the global crisis  will dent India's growth trajectory as investments and exports slow. Clearly, there is a peri od of painful adjust ment ahead of us. However, once the global economy begins to  recover, India's turn around will be sharper and swifter, backed by our str ong fundamentals and the untapped growth potential. Meanwhile, the challenge for th e government and the RBI is to manage the adjustment with as little pain as possible.  ", "26 Mar 09 MP.pdf": "India - Managing the Impact of the  Global Financial Crisis1 By Duvvuri Subbarao _______________________________________________________________   Introduction 1. Less than a year ago, much of wh at has happened in the Indian economy since last October would have been hard to antic ipate. I recall, around this time last year, the most fr equently asked questions (FAQs) were, what are the factors that put India on  a high growth trajectory and what can we do to remain there? Today, the FAQ is, when and how do we get back on to the high growth trajectory? The shar p turn around in the FAQs summarizes in a nutshell the impact of the global financial crisis on India.  Global Outlook 2. The global economic outlook deteriorat ed sharply over the last quarter.  In a sign of the ferocity of the down turn, the IMF marked down, yet again, its estimate for global growth in 2009 to a range of (-) 1.0 to (-) 0.5 per cent, the first global contraction in 60 years. With all the advanced economies \u2013 the United States, Europe and Japan - ha ving firmly gone into recession, the contagion of the crisis from the financia l sector to the real sector has been unforgiving and total.  Recent evidence s uggests that contractionary forces are strong: demand has slumped, production is plunging, job losses are rising and                                           1 Speech delivered at the Confederation of Indi an Industry's National Conference and Annual Session 2009 in New Delhi on March 26, 2009.   2credit markets remain in seizure. Mo st worryingly, world trade \u2013 the main channel through which the downturn w ill get transmitted on the way forward \u2013 is projected to contract by 2.8 per cen t in 2009, the fastest pace of shrinkage in the last 80 years.    3. Policy making around the world is in  clearly uncharted territory.  Governments and central banks across count ries have responde d to the crisis through big, aggressive and unconventiona l measures. There is a contentious debate on whether these measures are ad equate and appropriate, and when, if at all, they will start to show results.  There has also been a separate debate on how abandoning the rule book, driven by the tyranny of the short-term, is compromising medium-term sustainability.  What is clearly beyond debate  though is that this Great Recession of 2008/09 is going to be deeper and the recovery longer than  earlier thought.      Decoupling Hypothesis and Emerging Economies 4. Contrary to the 'decoupling hypothe sis', emerging economies too have been hit by the crisis.  The decoupli ng hypothesis, which was intellectually fashionable even as late as  a year ago, held that ev en if advanced economies went into a downturn, emerging economi es will remain unscathed because of their substantial foreign exchange reserves, improved policy framework, robust corporate balance shee ts and relatively health y banking sector.  In a rapidly globalizing world, the 'decoup ling hypothesis' wa s never totally persuasive.  Given the evidence of the last few months \u2013 capital flow  3reversals, sharp widening of spreads on sovereign and corporate debt and abrupt currency depreciations  - the 'decoupling hypothesis' stands invalidated.  Reinforcing the notion that in a globa lized world no country  can be an island, growth prospects of emerging economies have been undermined by the cascading financial crisis with, of c ourse, considerable  variation across countries.    Questions to be Addressed 5. India too has been impacted by the crisis, and by much more than we had earlier thought. Against this bac kground, what I propose to do is to address the following questions:    (i) Why has India been hit by the crisis? (ii) How has India been hit by the crisis? (iii) How have we responded to the challenge?  6. The answers to the above three quest ions form the basis for the fourth, and perhaps more important question. (iv) What is the outlook for India?   Why Has India Been Hit By the Crisis? 7. The ferocity with which the global crisis hit India dismayed many. And this dismay stems from two analytical strands.     48. The first analytic goes something like this.  The Indian banking system has had no direct exposure to the sub-pr ime mortgage assets or to the failed institutions.  It has very limited off- balance sheet activities or securitized assets.  In fact, our banks continue to remain sound and healthy.  So, the enigma is how can India be caught up in a crisis when it has nothing much to do with any of the maladies that ar e at the core of the crisis.    9. The second reason for dismay is that  India's recent growth has been driven predominantly by domestic consumption and domestic investment. External demand, as measured by mercha ndize exports, accounts for less than 15 per cent of our GDP.  The question then is, even if there is a global downturn, why should India be affected when its reliance on external demand is so limited?          10. The answer to both the above causes of dismay lies in globalization.  Let me explain.  First, India's integration into the world economy over the last decade has been remarkably rapid. Inte gration into the world implies more than just exports.  Goin g by the common measure of globalization, India's two-way trade (merchandize exports plus  imports), as a pr oportion of GDP, increased from 21.2 per cent in 1997-98, the year of the Asian crisis, to 34.7 per cent in 2007-08.      11. Second, India's financial integration with the world has been as deep as India's trade globalization, if not deep er. If we take an expanded measure of globalization, that is the ratio of tota l external transactions (gross current  5account flows plus gross capital flows)  to GDP, this ratio has more than doubled from 46.8 per cent in 1997- 98 to 117.4 per cent in 2007-08.    12. Importantly, the Indian corporate sector's access to external funding has markedly increased in the last five years.  Some numbers will help illustrate the point. In the five-year period 2003-08, the share of corporate investment in India's GDP rose by 9 percentage points. Corporate savings financed a little more than half of this , but a significant portion of the balance financing came from external s ources. While funds were available domestically, foreign funding was perc eived to be less expensive than domestic financing. On the other hand, in  a global market aw ash with liquidity and on the promise of India's growth pot ential, foreign inve stors and lenders were willing to take risks and finan ce investment in India.  Last year (2007/08), for example, India received cap ital inflows amounting to over 9 per cent of GDP as against a current account deficit in the balan ce of payments of just 1.5 per cent of GDP. These capital fl ows, in excess of the current account deficit, evidence the importance of extern al financing to the corporates and the depth of India's financial integration.    13. So, the reason India has been hit by the crisis, despite mitigating factors, is clearly India's rapid a nd growing integration into the global economy.     6How Has India Been Hit By the Crisis? 14. The contagion of the crisis has spre ad to India through all the channels \u2013 the financial channel, th e real channel, and importa ntly, as happens in all financial crises, the confidence channel.    15. Let us first look at the financial ch annel.  India's financial markets - equity market, money market, forex mark et and credit market - had all come under pressure from a number of directi ons.  First, as a consequence of the global liquidity squeeze, Indian cor porates found their overseas financing drying up, forcing corporates  to shift their credit demand to the domestic banking sector. Also, in their search for substitute financing, corporates withdrew their investment s in domestic money market mutual funds (MFs); consequently, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) where the MFs had invested a significant portion of thei r funds came under redemption pressure. This substitution of overseas financ ing by domestic financing brought both money markets and credit ma rkets under pressure.  Second, the forex market came under pressure because of reversal of  capital flows as part of the global deleveraging process. Simultaneously, corporates were converting the funds raised locally into foreign currency to meet their external obligations.  Both these factors put downward pressure on the rupee.  Third, the Reserve Bank's intervention in the forex market to ma nage the volatility in the rupee further added to liquidity tightening.     716. Now let me turn to the real chan nel. Here, the transmission of the global cues to the domestic economy has been quite straight forward \u2013 through the slump in demand for exports . The United States, European Union and the Middle East, which account for three quarters of India's goods and services trade, are in a sy nchronized down turn. Services  export growth is also likely to slow in the near term as the recession deepens and financial services firms \u2013 traditionally large users of outsourcing services \u2013 are restructured. Remittances from migrant workers too are likely to slow as the Middle East adjusts to lower crude prices and ad vanced economies go into a recession.  17. Beyond the financial and real channe ls of transmission as above, the crisis also spread through the confidence channel.  In sharp contrast to global financial markets, which went into a seizure on account of a crisis of confidence, Indian financial markets continued to function in an orderly manner.  Furthermore, our banks have  continued to lend. However, the tightened global liquidity situation in  the period immediately following the Lehman failure in mid-September 2008, comi ng as it did on top of a turn in the credit cycle, increased the risk aver sion of the financial system and made some banks cautious about lending.   18. The purport of the above explanation is to show how, despite not being part of the global financia l sector problem, India ha s been affected by the crisis through the adverse feedback loops between external shocks and domestic vulnerabilities.   8  How Have We Responded to the Challenge?  19. Let me now turn to how we responde d to the crisis.  The failure of Lehman Brothers in mid-September 2008 was followed in quick succession by several other large financial institu tions coming under severe stress.  This made financial markets around the wo rld uncertain and unsettled.  This contagion, as I explained above, spread  to emerging economies, and to India too. Both the government and the Rese rve Bank of India responded to the challenge in close coordination and consultation. The main plank of the government response was fiscal stimulus while the Reserve Bank's action comprised monetary accommodation a nd counter cyclical regulatory measures.   Monetary Policy Response  20. The Reserve Bank's policy respon se was aimed at containing the contagion from the outside - to keep the domestic money and credit markets functioning normally and see that the liqui dity stress did no t trigger solvency cascades. In particular, we targeted th ree objectives: first, to maintain a comfortable rupee liquidity position; second, to augment foreign exchange liquidity; and third, to maintain a policy framework that would keep credit delivery on track so as to arrest the moderation in growth. This marked a reversal of Reserve Bank's policy stan ce from monetary tightening in response to heightened inflationary pressures of  the previous period to monetary easing in response to easing infl ationary pressures and mode ration in growth in the  9current cycle. Our measures to meet the above objectives came in several policy packages starting mid-September 2008, on occasion in response to unanticipated global developments, and at  other times in anticipation of the impact of potential global devel opments on the Indian markets.   21. Our policy packages included, like in  the case of other central banks, both conventional and unconventional measures. On the conventional side, we reduced the policy interest rates a ggressively and rapidly, reduced the quantum of bank reserves impounded by the central bank and expanded and liberalized the refinance facilities fo r export credit. Me asures aimed at managing forex liquidity included an upw ard adjustment of the interest rate ceiling on the foreign currency deposits by  non-resident Indians, substantially relaxing the external commercial borrowings (ECB) regime for corporates, and allowing non-banking financial companies and housing finance companies access to foreign borrowing.  22. The important among the many unconventional measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India are a rupee-dollar swap facility for Indian banks to give them comfort in managing their short-term foreign funding requirements, an exclusive refinance window as also a special purpose vehicle for supporting non-banking financial companies, a nd expanding the lendable resources available to apex finance institutions for refinancing credit extended to small industries, housing and expor ts. Reflecting the rapid turn  of events that could  10impair assets down the line, we revers ed the counter - cy clical regulatory measures introduced in 2006.  Government's Fiscal Stimulus 23. Over the last five years, both the central and st ate governments in India have made a serious e fforts to reverse the fiscal excesses of the past.  At the heart of these efforts was th e Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act which mandated a calibrated road map towards fiscal sustainability.   24. The depth and extraordinary impact  of this crisis , however, clearly indicated the need for c ounter cyclical public sp ending. Accordingly, the central government invoked the emergenc y provisions of the FRBM Act to seek relaxation from the fiscal targ ets and launched two fiscal stimulus packages in December 2008 and January 2009.  These fiscal stimulus packages, together amounting to abou t 3 per cent of GDP, included additional public spending, government guaranteed funds for infrastructure spending, cuts in indirect taxes, expanded guarant ee cover for credit to micro and small enterprises, and additional support to  exporters. These stimulus packages came on top of an already announced expanded safety-net for rural poor, a farm loan waiver package and salary increases for government staff, all of which too should stimulate demand.    11Impact of Monetary Measures 25. Taken together, the measures put  in place since mid-September 2008 have ensured that the Indian financia l markets continue to function in an orderly manner. The cumulative amount  of primary liqui dity potentially available to the financial system th rough these measures  is about Rs.390,000 crore or 7 per cent of GDP. This sizeable easing has ensured a comfortable liquidity position startin g mid-November 2008 as evidenced by a number of indicators including the weighted average call money rate, the overnight money market rate and the yield on the 10-year benchmark government security.  Taking the signal from the policy rate cut, many of the big banks have reduced their benchmark prime lending rates. Bank credit has expanded too, but slower than last year. Howe ver, Reserve Bank\u2019s rough calculations show that the overall flow of resources to the commercial sector is less than what it was last year. This is because, even though bank credit has expanded, it has not fully offset the decline in  non-bank flow of resources to the commercial sector.  Evaluating the Response 26. In evaluating the response to the crisis, it is important to remember that although the origins of  the crisis are common around the world, the crisis has impacted different economies diffe rently. Importantly, in advanced economies where it originated, the crisis spread from the financial sector to the real sector. In emerging economies, th e transmission of external shocks to  12domestic vulnerabilities has typically been  from the real sector to the financial sector.   27. Countries have accordingly responded to the crisis depending on their specific country circumstances. Thus, even as policy responses across countries are broadly similar, their precise design, quantum, sequencing and timing have varied. In particular, while policy responses in advanced economies have had to contend with bot h the unfolding financial crisis and deepening recession, in I ndia, our response has been predominantly driven by the need to arrest modera tion in economic growth.     What is the Outlook for India?  28. The outlook for India going forward is mixed. There is clear evidence of economic activity slowing down. Real GDP growth has moderated modestly in the first an d second quarters of 2008/09, and sharply in the third quarter. The services sector, which has been our prime growth engine for the last five years, is slowing, main ly in construction, transport and communication, trade, hotels and restaura nts sub-sectors. For the first time in seven years, exports have declined in ab solute terms for four months in a row during October 2008 - January 2009. Recent data indicate that the demand for bank credit is slackening despite co mfortable liquidity in the system. Dampened demand has dented corporate margins while the uncertainty surrounding the crisis ha s affected business confidence. The index of industrial production has shown negative growth for two recent months and  13investment demand is decelerating. All th ese factors suggest that growth will moderate more than we had earlier thought.  29. In addressing the fall out of the crisis, India has several advantages. Some of these are recent developments . Most notably, headline inflation, as measured by the wholesale price inde x, has fallen sharply though consumer price inflation is yet to moderate. Clear ly, falling commodity prices have been the key drivers behind the disinflation;  however, some contribution has also come from slowing domestic demand. The decline in inflation should revive and support consumption demand and reduce input costs for corporates. Furthermore, the decline in global crude prices and naphtha prices, if sustained, will reduce the size of subsid ies to oil and fertilizer companies, opening up fiscal space for infrastructure  spending. From the external sector perspective, it is projecte d that imports will shrink more than exports keeping the current account deficit modest.  30. There are also several structural f actors that have come to India's aid. First, notwithstanding the severity a nd multiplicity of the adverse shocks, India's financial markets have shown admira ble resilience. This is in large part because India's banking system remain s sound, healthy, well capitalized and prudently regulated. Second, our co mfortable reserve position provides confidence to overseas investors. Third, since a large majority of Indians do not participate in equity and asset markets, the negative impact of the wealth loss effect that is plaguing the adva nced economies should be quite muted.  14Consequently, consumption demand shoul d hold up well. Fourth, because of India's mandated priority sector lendi ng, institutional credit for agriculture has remained unaffected. The farm loan waiver package implemented by the Government should further insulate the agriculture sector from the crisis. Finally, over the years, India has built an  extensive network of social safety-net programmes, including the flagship rural employment guarantee programme. These uniquely Indian versi ons of automatic stabilizers should protect the poor from the extrem e impact of the global crisis.   RBI's Policy Stance 31. Going forward, the Reserve Bank's polic y stance will continue to be to maintain comfortable rupee and fo rex liquidity positions. There are indications that pressures on mutual f unds have eased and that NBFCs too are making the necessary adjustments to ba lance their assets and liabilities. Despite the contraction in export demand, we will be able to manage our balance of payments. It is the Reserve Bank's expectation that commercial banks will take the signal from the policy rates reduction to adjust their deposit and lending rates in or der to keep credit flowing to productive sectors. In particular, the special refinance windows opened by the Reserve Bank for the MSME (micro, small and medium ente rprises) sector, h ousing sector and export sector should see credit flowing to  these sectors. Also the SPV set up for extending assistance to NBFCs s hould ease the financing constraints of NBFCs. The government's fiscal stimulus should be able to supplement these efforts from both supply and demand sides.  15  When the Turn Around Comes 32. Over the last five years, India clocked an unprecedented nine per cent growth, driven largely by domestic cons umption and investment even as the share of net exports has been rising. This was no accident or happenstance. True, the benign global environment, eas y liquidity and low interest rates helped, but at the heart of India's gr owth were a growing entrepreneurial spirit, rise in productivity and increa sing savings. These fundamental strengths continue to be in place. Nevertheless, the global crisis  will dent India's growth trajectory as investments and exports slow . Clearly, there is a period of painful adjustment ahead of us. However, once the global economy begins to recover, India's turn around will be sharper and swifter, backed by our strong fundamentals and the untapped growth potential. Meanwhile, the challenge for the government and the RBI is to mana ge the adjustment with as little pain as possible.  ", "1 Feb 12 MP.pdf": "Price Stability, Financial Stability and  Sovereign Debt Sustainability   Policy Challenges from the New Trilemma1 - Duvvuri Subbarao ___________________________________________________________________  I have great pleasure in welcoming you all to the Reserve Bank\u2019s Second International Research Conference (SIRC).   2. We held our first international confer ence two years ago, in February 2010, as a flagship event of our Platinum Jubilee celebrations. Many of you who had attended that conference complimented us for its quality and urge d us to repeat it. As much as we were flattered by those co mpliments, I also suspect that the urging for a repeat was at least partly motivated by the prospect of escaping from the bitter cold of some of your home countries at th is time of the year. So, here\u2019s welcoming all of you to warm and sunny Mumbai.  Conference Theme 3. Let me start by explaining the motivation for the conference theme: \u201cPrice Stability, Financial Stability and Sovereig n Debt Sustainability: Policy Challenges from the New Trilemma\u201d.  4. The global financial crisis followed by the euro zone debt crisis has changed the theology of central banking in a fundamental way. The orthodoxy of                                                  1 Inaugural speech by Dr. Duvvuri Subbarao, Go vernor, Reserve Bank of  India, at the Second International Research Conference of the Reserve Bank of India at Mumbai on February 1, 2012. central banking before the 2008 crisis was: single objective - pri ce stability; single instrument - short-term interest rate. Although most central banks deviated to different extents from this minimalist model, this came increasingly to be considered the holy grail.   5. The crisis came as a powerful rebuke  to central banks for having neglected financial stability in their single-minded pur suit of price stability. By the time of our first conference two years ago, a c onsensus was developing around the view that financial stability has to be within th e explicit policy calculus of central banks, although opinion was divided on the precise nature of institutional arrangements for maintaining financial stability.  6. Fast forward to 2011/12. Even as central  banks are grappli ng with balancing the demands of price stability and financ ial stability, there is now yet another powerful assault on central bank orthodoxy arising from the big elephant in the room - the euro zone sovereign debt cris is. The European Central Bank (ECB) is being called upon to bend and stretch its mandate to bail out sovereigns who have forfeited the confidence of markets. Actua lly that is an understatement. In reality, the ECB is being challenged on why it is , to use an Indian word, being so brahminical about its mandate when the wo rld around it is collapsing. The argument, in its essence, is that if a central bank is committed to financial stability, it cannot ignore the feedback loop between financial stab ility and sovereign debt sustainability, and by extension therefore, it  has to be mindful of sovereign debt sustainability concerns.   2 7. What do these trends engendered by the crisis indicate? In particular, is it the case that the mandate of central banks is set to expand from the single objective of price stability to multiple objectives of price stability, financial stability and sovereign debt sustainability? Can centr al banks simultaneously support all these three objectives and do so efficiently? That in essence is the new trilemma.   8. The new trilemma triggers several questions. How do the three objectives underlying the trilemma reinforce each othe r, and in what ways do they conflict with each other?  What is their impact on growth? Is the trilemma an exclusive phenomenon of crisis times, or does it manifest in normal times as well? What is the nature and extent of the responsibil ity of central banks for each of these objectives? Are central banks equipped to handle these additional responsibilities? And finally, what does this expanded ma ndate mean for the effectiveness and autonomy of central banks?   9. That indeed is a long list of questions . The purpose of this conference is to think through these weighty questions centred around this new trilemma.   Is This Indeed a Trilemma? 10. We deliberated internally on whether this evolving challenge for central banks would indeed qualify as a trilemma. On e view was that this is not strictly a trilemma as there is no theory which says that we cannot simultaneously obtain price stability, financial st ability and sovereign debt sustainability. The opposing view was that what central banks have at hand is indeed a trilemma in as much as  3there can be clear tensions between th e objectives underlying the new trilemma, and central banks may not be able to dete rmine, with any degree of exactitude, what inter se priority must be accorded to e ach of the three objectives under different sets of circumstances. So, is this a trilemma or not? To compound the search for an answer, the word \u2018trile mma\u2019 has not made it to all standard dictionaries yet. So, permit me a little i ndulgence into the world of trilemmas.   The World of Trilemmas 11. Epicurus, the Greek Philosopher who lived around 300 BCE, was possibly the first to use the concept of a trilemma to  reject the idea of an omnipotent God. The distinction of being the first to actu ally use the word \u2018trilemma\u2019 goes perhaps to the 17th century English non-conformist clergyman, Philip Henry, who recorded in his diary, \u201cWe are put hereby to a Trilemma, to  turn flat Independents, or to strike in with the conformists, or to sit down in former silence .\u201d  Arthur C. Clarke , the British science fiction writer, cited a trilemma in trying to achieve production quickly and cheaply while also maintaining high quality, leading to the quip: \u201cQuick, Cheap, Good: Pick two\u201d. In public choice theory, there is  the trilemma of juggling three priorities - coverage, co st and choice - when offering a public service.  12. If we turn to economics, we will see that trilemmas have indeed proliferated. Dani Rodrik (2007) argue d that if a country  wants more of globalization, it must either give up some  democracy or some national sovereignty. Niall Ferguson (2009) highlighted the trilem ma of a choice between commitment to  4globalization, to social order and to  a small state (meaning limited state intervention). In one of his FT colu mns, Martin Wolf spoke about the US Republican Party\u2019s fiscal pol icy trilemma: the belief that  large budget deficits are ruinous; a continued eagerness to cut taxes; a nd an utter lack of in terest in spending cuts on a large enough scale. Then we have the Earth Trilemma (EEE), which posits that for economic development (E),  we need increased energy expenditure (E), but this raises the environmental issue (E).   13. The trilemma more directly relevant to  this conference th eme is a financial stability trilemma put fo rward by Dirk Schoenmaker (2008), explaining the incompatibility within the euro zone of a stable financial system, an integrated financial system, and national financial st ability policies. By far the most high profile current trilemma, as per some an alysts, is the euro-zone trilemma: the seeming irreconcilability betw een its three wishes: a single currency, minimal fiscal contribution to bail outs, and the ECB\u2019s commitment to low inflation.   The Old Trilemma 14. Even as I have spoken about more recent trilemmas in economics, the prima donna of all of them is Mundell\u2019s \u2018impo ssible trinity\u2019. This old trilemma asserts that a country cannot simultaneously maintain  all three policy goa ls of free capital flows, a fixed exchange rate and an i ndependent monetary policy. The impossible trinity, as students of economics have l earnt for over a half century, has a strong theoretical foundation in the Mundell-Fleming model developed in the 1960s.     5 Fixed Exchan geRateIndependent Monetary Polic yFree Capital Flows   Impossible Trinit y           Figure - 1   15. The choices the world made under the impossible trinity varied over time. Under the gold standard, exchange rates were fixed and capital  could move around, but central banks were forced to adjust inte rest rates to ensure they did not run out of reserves. This could lead to pressu re on the real economy, and a lot of booms and busts.  16. Under Bretton Woods, we had fixed exchange rates (with occasional adjustments) and independent monetary policy, but capital mobility was highly restricted; when I first went abroad ove r 30 years ago, Indians couldn\u2019t take out more than $20, no matter the purpose of the trip. The Bretton Woods system broke down under the weight of fixed exchange rates, and the world moved to largely floating exchange rates. Capital has flowed freely round the world.  17. In the post-Bretton Woods era, countr ies have made diffe rent choices. The most common case, typical across advanced  economies, is to give up on a fixed exchange rate so as  to run an open economy with an  independent monetary policy. On the other hand, economies that adopt a hard peg give up on independence of  6monetary policy. Examples include the currency boards set up by Hong Kong and, for a time, Argentina. More recently, responding to a rapid appreciation of the Swiss Franc as a result of the safe haven effect, Switzerland declared its commitment to defend a pre-announced exchange rate.   18. History is replete also with exampl es of countries aiming to achieve all three goals at the same time, and failing to do so, often in a disorderly way. Thailand\u2019s decision to abandon the hard pe g against the US dollar in July 1997 is a classic example.   19. Notwithstanding its real life validatio n, it is not as if Mundell\u2019s \u2018Impossible Trinity\u2019 is inviolable. Many of the assumptions underlying this model do not often hold; indeed the new open economy macr oeconomy models that build in price rigidities and monopolistic competiti on demonstrate policy dynamics quite different from those built in the Mundell-Fle ming tradition. It is also not the case that countries are for ced into corner solu tions at the nodes of the impossible trinity triangle. As it happens, reflecting the for ces of globalization and their asymmetric impact, many emerging economies have opted for middle solutions.   Impossible Trinity to Holy Trinity 20. In the context of this conference, is the new trilemma - the simultaneous pursuit of price stability, fina ncial stability and soverei gn debt sustainability - a new impossible trinity? Possibly not. Ther e is no theory which says that these objectives are inconsistent with one anothe r. It can even be argued that the three  7objectives reinforce each other, and that  together they sustain growth, thereby constituting not an impossible trinity, but  actually a holy trinity of objectives.

That does not by any means imply that  the holy trinity of objectives can always be achieved simultane ously, or once achieved, ca n be maintained as such indefinitely. There would be tensions and trade-offs, especially in the short-term. In particular, the tensions materialize with br utal force in a state of disequilibrium - when inflation is off target, the financial system is fragile and public debt is ballooning. To the extent we  have to manage these tensions, the policy problem qualifies as a trilemma.   The Many Ways in Which the New Trilemma Plays Out 22. Policies in pursuit of the three objec tives under the tril emma interact in complex, and often unintended ways. Sometimes they are supportive of each other;  8at other times, they may run counter to each other. More  perplexingly, the tensions and trade-offs may be different in crisis times from normal times.                  New TrilemmaSovereign Debt  Sustainability  Price Stability Financial Stability Figure - 3  23. Let me attempt to illustrate this by citing some examples from global experience, including recent experience. Given the three objectives underlying the new trilemma, and the two-way directions in which they can interact, we have a total of six \u2018cause and impact\u2019 bilateral in teractions. I will consider them one by one.   (i) Price Stability \u2192 Financial Stability 24. Before the global financial crisis, the stereotype view was that price stability and financial stability compleme nt each other i.e. monetary policy and policies for financial stability are mutually  reinforcing.  The crisis has proved that wrong. Note that we saw the global financial sector come to the brink of collapse in the midst of a period of extraordinary price stability.   9 25. Indeed the experience of the crisis has prompted an  even stronger assertion - that there is a trade-off between price stability and financial stability. In other words, the more successful a central bank is  with price stability, the more likely it is to imperil financial stability. The argum ent goes as follows. The extended period of steady growth and low and stable infl ation during the Great Moderation lulled central banks into complacency. Only with the benefit of hindsight is it now clear that the prolonged period of price stability  blindsided policy makers to the cancer of financial instability growing in the underbelly.  26. An even more recent example of a conflict between policies for financial stability and price stability is of the ECB reversing its crisis driven expansionary stance by raising interest rates twice duri ng April-July 2011. The ECB justified this on the argument of stemming the underlyi ng inflationary pressures, but many criticized this move as being premature and as clearly unhelpful to restoring financial stability. Of course, we all know that the ECB reversed these hikes during November-December 2011 in response to the euro zone slow down.   (ii) Financial Stability \u2192 Price Stability  27. Let us now see the interaction in the reverse direction. Whether policies aimed at financial stability can affect price stability is a debate that has stayed with us all through the period of management of the crisis. Many analysts have argued that the extraordinary monetary expansion, especially by the Fe d, to bring interest rates to the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB) and following it up with two rounds of \u2018Quantitative Easing\u2019 (QE), a ll aimed at restoring financ ial stability, may actually  10be sowing the seeds of inflation. The ar gument goes that since the inflationary impact of easy monetary policies is difficu lt to see real time, the Fed risks going overboard with monetary easing thereby jeopardizing future price stability.   28. We also have an illustration fr om emerging economies of policies for financial stability affecting price stabili ty. During the crisis, EME central banks eased monetary policy to provide relief to the financial sector, but this also saw inflation quickly resurging when recovery started.   (iii) Financial Stability \u2192 Sovereign Debt Sustainability  29. The management of the crisis offered an important lesson on how policies aimed at restoring financial stability could impair sovere ign debt sustainability. By far the most obvious illustration of this link is the cost of bail outs of failing financial institutions, accompanied by \u2018fiscal stimulus\u2019, to prevent the financial sector problems from causing overall econom ic activity to colla pse. The fiscal action was unquestionably necessary to re store financial stability. But the net impact need not always be benign. There are circumstances under which fiscal expansion in support of financial stab ility can threaten sovereign debt sustainability. That will happen if the sove reign is already highly indebted, and the recovery is not quick enough or robust enough. Governments will then see their revenues falling, will need to borrow to bridge the fiscal gap, and can potentially get trapped in a self-reinforcing adverse fiscal feedback loop eventually jeopardizing their sovereign debt sustainability.     11(iv) Sovereign Debt Sustainability \u2192 Financial Stability 30. For transmission of shocks from the sovereign to the banking system, the evolving situation in the euro  zone is clearly the most glaring example. Consider Greece, where banks are being asked to share the burden of bailing out the government, the so called priv ate sector involvement - PSI , so that sovereign debt could be brought down to sustainable levels . But this will affect their collective viability and potentially threaten broa der financial stability. There has been acrimony over whether the PSI is voluntary or  involuntary.  For th e purpose of this issue, that debate is a technicality; it doe s not alter the basic contours of contagion from sovereign debt to financial stability.   31. The ECB\u2019s new term repo (LTRO) wi ndow offers another example of how sovereign debt sustainability concerns can affect financial stability. This new window offers banks three-y ear money at the repo rate to encourage them to use that money to lend to sovereigns, taking advantage of the arb itrage opportunity. But this financial engineering is a fragile and potentially problematic arrangement. Banks will need to post additional collateral  with ECB if the bonds they offered fall in value or suffer a credit downgrade. For pr ecisely the same reasons - fall in value and credit downgrade - banks will need to  provide additional cap ital against monies they have lent to soverei gns. This could put banks on a collateral spiral and erode overall financial stability.    12(v) Sovereign Debt Sustainability \u2192 Price Stability  32. The most obvious route for soverei gn debt concerns impinging on price stability is through the monetization of  government debt. Central banks do, of course, resort to open market operations (OMOs) - buying and selling government paper - for purposes of liquidity manageme nt. But if the motivation for the OMO is to help out a fiscally vulnerable soverei gn or to reduce the cost of borrowing for the sovereign, central banks coul d end up holding price stabil ity hostage to sovereign debt concerns.   33. Fiscal concerns can dominate monetary  policy in other less dramatic ways. In the years before the crisis, an increasing num ber of governments were voluntarily adopting fiscal responsibility  rules, thereby allowing room for autonomous monetary policy. These rule-b ased fiscal regimes unravelled during the crisis as both governments and cen tral banks implemented expansionary policies in close coordination. While such  coordination during the crisis was not questioned except by extreme purists, now  in the recovery period, several fundamental concerns  are resurfacing.   34. At the heart of these concerns is whether monetary policy is once again becoming hostage to fiscal compulsions. Th e specifics of the de bate vary but the basic issues are similar. In the US, the debate is over the trade-off between short-term fiscal stimulus and long-term fis cal consolidation. In the euro area, the question is about the shared benefits of  a monetary union without the shared responsibilities of a fiscal union. In India, the question has been whether the OMOs  13conducted by the Reserve Bank to manage systemic liquidity  are acting as a disincentive for fiscal discipline. The que stions all around are: are central banks being forced beyond their comfort zone to subordinate their monetary policy stance to the government\u2019s fiscal stance? Aren\u2019t  the so called unconventional measures, in reality, quasi-fiscal measures?  Are central  banks, in the process, compromising their basic commitment to price stability?   (vi) Price Stability \u2192 Sovereign Debt Sustainability 35. There are several ways in which po licies aimed at price stability can influence sovereign debt sust ainability. Higher interest ra tes, necessitated to combat inflation, raise the costs of debt to the government. Also, if the government has large subsidies on its budge t, as do many emerging a nd developing economies, inflation could raise the cost of subsidie s thereby raising the borrowing need of the government. On the other hand, government s with large debts may not actually mind a bit of inflation as it affords them an  opportunity to inflat e away some of the debt.   36. I have spoken about the tensions and tr ade-offs between th e three ob jectives underlying the new trilemma. The examples  that I have given are by no means exhaustive but are intended to illustrate the complex policy challenges they pose to central banks.     14Four Questions Underlying the New Trilemma  37. Now let me turn to some important questions that central banks will confront in managing the new trilemma. In particular, I will rais e four questions.   Question 1: Are We Seeing a Return of Fiscal Dominance of Monetary Policy?  38. This question has surfaced with vigour in the context of the euro zone crisis. The ECB claims that its bond purchase programme is aimed at restoring liquidity and improving monetary transmission. But ma ny analysts believe that this is a thinly veiled attempt to shore up sovereign borrowing and that the ECB is actually acquiescing in fiscal dominance.   39. Although this tension betw een the central bank manda te and sovereign debt sustainability is presently being played out in Europe, it is not new; nor is it unique to Europe. The seventy odd years since the Great Depression sa w a famous rivalry between fiscal and monetary policies for influence. Historically central banks suffered from fiscal dominance since they had to acquiesce in governments \u2018borrowing as much as required at  as low a cost as possible\u2019.   40. This state of affairs started changing  in the 1980s, with a wave of support for central bank independence arising largel y in response to the damage inflicted by the stagflation of the 1970s and the clear le sson that high inflation is detrimental to sustainable growth. So, fiscal dominance gr adually yielded to independent central banks, free of short-term compulsions, targetting largely, and in some cases  15exclusively, price stability. Now it seems we are seeing a reversal of that trend with central banks being called upon to mind sovereign debt sustainability concerns.  41. Fiscal dominance manifests through the central bank acquiescing in the fiscal stance of the government. This usua lly happens through m onetization of debt through the central bank\u2019s bond buying pr ogramme. Central banks typically conduct OMOs more as reverse transac tions (repos) for liqui dity management purposes in line with their monetary policy st ance and intermediate targets. In that case, they should be seen as pure monetary  policy operations. But at times, OMOs could be motivated by the objective of providing liquidi ty to support government borrowing or of reducing the yield on treas ury bonds to enhance debt sustainability. It then becomes a case of acquiescence in fiscal dominance. There is often only a thin line, and the interpretation of the motivation for outright OMOs could vary depending on the circumstances.   42. In the presence of large sovereign borrowing that makes the government\u2019s fiscal stance unsustainable, central banks t ypically have little choice. If they do not conduct OMOs to bring systemic liquidity within reasonable limits, they risk losing control over financial stabil ity. If they do conduct OMOs , they risk losing control over price stability. What this really says is  that fiscal responsibility is much more than a question of whether monetary policy is  independent or not. It is a question of sustaining macroeconomic stability.    16Question 2: Will the Management  of the New Trilemma Erode the Autonomy and Accountability of Central Banks?  43. The much prized autonomy of centr al banks has come under assault post-crisis with an influential view gaining ground that one of the principal causes of the crisis was the unbridled autonomy of centr al banks. The standard argument for central bank autonomy is that autonomy enhances the credibility of the central bank\u2019s inflation management credentials. M onetary policy typically acts with a lag, and price stability therefore ha s to be viewed in a medium  term perspective. Having autonomy frees the central bank from the pressure of responding to short-term developments, deviating from its infla tion target and thereby compromising its medium term inflation goals.  44. Now that the importance of central ba nk autonomy in monetary policy has come to be largely accepted, the question is: will additional responsibilities underlying the new trilemma affect that autonomy? And how will this new situation also affect the accountability stru ctures of the central  banks? It may be useful to take stock of the apprehensions in this regard.   45. For overseeing systemic stability, ne w governance structures have emerged after the global crisis. These include th e Financial Services  Oversight Council (FSOC) in the US, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) in the UK and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) in the EU. Here in India, we have the Financial Stability and Development C ouncil (FSDC). The precise institutional arrangements vary, but across all of them, cen tral banks have a lead responsibility.    1746. With these new institutional arrangemen ts for financial stability in place, the autonomy question has acquired an ad ditional dimension. No te that central bank autonomy has worked because they could keep at arms length from the governments. But once a coordination mechanism is in place, these barriers may melt away. Also, even if that is wh at the book says, it may be difficult to straitjacket the discussion at the coordi nation forum to financial stability. As we have seen, there are no \u2018pure\u2019  financial stability issues; they are all inter-connected. A discussion on financial stability could ve ry well lead to a discussion on monetary policy. What then of the autonomy of the cen tral bank? This appr ehension, as all of you will appreciate, is  non-trivial.   47. If we now add responsibility for sovere ign debt sustainability to this already complex situation, the reason for apprehensi on about the threat to the autonomy of central banks becomes more obvious. Sovere ign debt is a quinte ssentially political subject, and as we noted earlier, the ve ry foundation of central bank autonomy is justified on the need to free monetary po licy from fiscal dominance. By requiring central banks to be mindful of sovereign debt  sustainability concer ns as part of the \u2018new trilemma\u2019, is the hard won gain of freedom from fiscal compulsions being compromised? But look at it also from the opposite perspective. Given that investor trust in public debt is part of the foundati on of a nation-state, is it realistic for a central bank to remain indifferent to sovereign debt sustainability?  48. The new trilemma also poses questions for central banks on the accountability front. With a si ngle objective of price stab ility, the deliverable could  18be precisely defined, the outcome accura tely measured, and accountability clearly extracted. Multiple objectives, and as we have seen, with tensions and trade-offs between them, can diffuse and erode this accountability mechanism. The central bank can always explain away any failure on one front as a resu lt of policies to defend another front.  49. There are no easy answers to these apprehensions about the impact of the new trilemma on central bank autonomy and accountability. Governments and central banks in each jurisdiction will have to define the nature and extent of the latter\u2019s responsibility for financial stability  and sovereign debt sustainability. I can only lay down certain tenets that must info rm this process. First, the fundamental responsibility of central banks for pri ce stability should not be compromised. Second, central banks should have a lead, but not exclusive, responsibility, for financial stability. Third, the boundaries of central bank responsibility for sovereign debt sustainability should be clearly defined. Fourth, in the matter of ensuring financial stability, the government must normally leave the responsibility to the regulators, assuming an activist ro le only in times of crisis.   Question 3:  Does the Pursuit of the New Trilemma Militate Against Growth?  50. My short answer to this question is \u2018no\u2019 . Let me elaborate. It is possible that in the short-term, policies aimed at price stability, financial stability and sovereign debt sustainability could, at times, run counter to policies required for promoting growth. But growth achieved at the cost of the objectives of the new trilemma cannot be sustained. What can be sustained is only growth that is consistent with  19these objectives. So, some sacrifice ratio may be operative in the short-term, but in the medium term, there is no trade off between sustainable growth and maintaining the objectives of th e new trilemma.   51. Let me illustrate this with reference to the debate that played out quite actively in India all of last year around the growth-inflation trade-off. We had inflation ruling all through the year in th e range of 9-10 per cent. To combat this, the Reserve Bank has had to tighten moneta ry policy - raising rates, as all our critics are fond of saying repe atedly - a record total of 13 times. While inflation did not show any downward trend till late in the calendar year 2011, growth has certainly moderated. The Reserve Bank\u2019s late st projection for growth for FY12 is 7 per cent, down from 8.4 per cent last year. The criticism has been that we could not bring inflation down but only ended up hurting growth. This  is not the occasion to enter a defence of our position. But in the context of this conference, the criticism throws up an important issue on th e growth-inflation trade-off.   52. Evidence from empirical research s uggests that the relationship between growth and inflation is non-linear. At low inflation and stable inflation expectations, there is a trade-off between growth and inflation. But above a certain threshold level of inflation, the trade-off disappears, this relationship reverses, and high inflation actually starts taking a toll on growth. Estimates by the Reserve Bank using different methodologies put the threshold level of inflation in the range of 4% - 6%. With WPI inflation ruling above 9 per cent till recently, we were way past this threshold. At this high level, inflat ion is unambiguously in imical to growth; it  20saps investor confidence and erodes medium term growth prospects. The Reserve Bank\u2019s monetary tightening all through last  year was accordingly geared towards safeguarding medium term growth even if  it meant some sacrifice in near-term growth.  53. The debate on the trade-off between financial stability and growth runs along roughly similar lines. Post-crisis, regu lation of financial institutions is being tightened. In particular, under the Basel III package, banks will be required to hold higher capital, better qualit y capital and also build up cap ital and liquidity buffers. What does this mean for growth?  54. A BIS study, undertaken by a group led by  Stephen Ceccheti, estimates that a one percentage point increas e in the target ratio of tangible common equity (TCE) to risk-weighted assets (RWA) phased in over a nine year pe riod reduces output by close to 0.2 per cent.  The study argues though that as the financial system makes the required adjustment, these costs will  dissipate and then reverse after the adjustment period, and the growth path will return to its original trajectory.  A Basel Committee study estimates that there wi ll be net positive benefits from Basel III because of the reduced probability of a crisis and reduced volatility in output in response to a shock.  An IIF study, however, estimates a higher sacrifice ratio - that the G3 (US, Euro Area and Japan) will lose  0.3 percentage points from their annual growth rates over the full ten-year period 2011-2020.  55. What are the implications of these nu mbers relating to growth sacrifice for emerging market economies (EMEs)?  Let me take the example of India.   21Admittedly, the capital to risk weighted asset ratio (CRAR) of our banks, at the aggregate level, is above the Basel III requirement although a few individual banks may fall short and may have to raise capita l.  But capital adequacy today does not necessarily mean capital adequacy going fo rward.  As the economy grows, so too will the credit demand, requiring banks to expa nd their balance sheets, and in order to be able to do so, they will have to augment their capital.  56. In a structurally transforming econo my with rapid upward mobility like India, credit demand will expand faster than GDP for several reasons.  First, India will shift increasingly from services to manufactures whose credit intensity is higher per unit of GDP.  Second, we need to at least double our investment in infrastructure which will place enormous demands on credit.  Finally, financial inclusion, which both the Government and th e Reserve Bank are driving, will bring millions of low income households into the formal financial system with almost all of them needing credit.  What all this means is that we are going to have to impose higher capital requirements on banks as pe r Basel III at a time when the economy\u2019s credit demand is going to expand rapidly.  How best can we resolve this tension between the demands of growth  and the demands of financ ial stability is a question that we in India and several other EMEs will have to address.     57. I have gone at some length on this not to argue that the costs of financial stability outweigh the benefits, but to argue that the cost-benefit calculus will vary from country to country, and will vary  for a given country over time. So, the  22challenge for every country, advanced, em erging and developing, is to tailor its financial stability policies to maximize the benefit cost ratio on a dynamic scale.   58. Now let me come to the third leg of  the equation - the link between growth and sovereign debt sustainabi lity. Like with the other two legs of the new trilemma, even in the case of sovereign debt, there is an inflexion point  beyond which fiscal deficits militate against growt h. Government borrowing is not bad per se, but excessive borrowing is. There is therefore a need to cap total public debt as a proportion of GDP.   59 What is equally important in respect of fiscal management is the quality of public expenditure. If the government borrows and squanders that money away on unproductive current expenditure, both fiscal  sustainability and growth would be jeopardized. Governments need to sp end on merit goods and public goods, in particular on improving human and social capital and on physical infrastructure.   60. So, after all this discussion, what is  the answer to the question: does the pursuit of the new trilemma militate agai nst growth? No. It does not. But there could be some trade-offs and government s will have to tailor their policies to ensure that the benefit - cost calculus is always maximised.   Question 4: What are the Limits to Unconventional Policy Measures? 61. As the crisis exploded with brutal intensity and depth, central banks around the world acted with an unusual show of policy force, ferociously cutting policy rates to near zero or even zero. Realizing soon that this was not sufficien t to restore  23calm and confidence to the markets, they had to follow up the conventional measures with a slew of unconventional measures variously described as quantitative and credit easing.   62. The first wave of unconventional meas ures was aimed at providing liquidity to the system either by way of collate ralized loans through the repo window or outright purchase of bonds. Liquidity manageme nt is of course standard monetary policy procedure. What made this unconventional were mainly two things. The first was the quantum of operations. The volumes were large, and were aimed at flooding the market with liquidity, much beyond what is expected in normal times.   63. The second characteristic that made  liquidity infusion unconventional was the relaxation of standards regarding th e type of bonds bought under the OMOs. In this regard, different central banks relaxe d regulations to different extents. While the Bank of England stuck to treasuries, the Fed bought federally backed mortgage bonds in addition to treasuries. The Ba nk of Japan went further buying also corporate bonds, commercial paper, exch ange traded funds and real estate investment trusts.   64. The second wave of unconventional measures went beyond repo operations and OMOs. The Bank of Japan extended targ eted loans to banks to spur long term investment. The Fed supplemented two rounds  of QE with \u2018operation twist\u2019 - of purchasing longer term treasuries against sale of short-term treasuries in an effort to depress the entire yield curve rather than just its short e nd. Last week, it also began  24publishing the expected interest rate path  for the coming years. The ECB, as noted earlier, is providing three-year loans to banks.  65. What of emerging economy central banks? They too ha d resorted to unconventional measures although their po licy rates did not hit the zero lower bound. In the Reserve Bank, for example, at th e height of the crisis, we operated a term repo window to enable banks to meet  the liquidity requi rement of mutual funds and non-bank finance companies (NBFCs). We relaxed the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) prescription for banks by upto 1.5 percentage points of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) for this  purpose. The risk weight on banks\u2019 exposure to NBFCs, which was raised earli er, was rolled back. The restriction on commercial banks in buying back the CD s held by mutual funds was lifted. We also instituted a foreign currency swap facility for banks.    66. Unconventional measures have been  contentious. Central banks have largely maintained that the unconventional m easures they deployed are a part of the monetary policy arsenal, and that the inte nt behind them is to improve monetary transmission. Their critics have argued that central banks have actually stepped beyond their mandates to accommodate extraneous compulsions.    67. All in all, the global fi nancial crisis and the ongoing Eurozone crisis have raised important questions about the unconventional measures that central banks can resort to - their range, intent and the way the intent should be communicated to the markets. I am sure this conference will visit this debate in much greater detail over the next two days.  25 Conclusion 68. Let me now conclude by summarizing what I have sai d. I explained the rationale for the conference theme: \u201c Price Stability, Fin ancial Stability and Sovereign Debt Sustainability: Policy Challenges from the New Trilemma \u201d. I then illustrated how the three legs under the new trilemma interact with one another. Thereafter I raised the following four questions that central banks need to address in the context of the new trilemma: (i) Are we seeing a return of fiscal dominance of monetary policy?  (ii) Will the management of the new trilemma erode the autonomy and accountability of central banks?  (iii) Does the pursuit of the new trilemma militate against growth?  (iv) What are the limits to unconventional policy measures?  69. To what extent are the old and ne w trilemmas similar? Under the old trilemma - the impossible trinity - countri es had to sacrifi ce one of the three objectives - fixed exchange rate, indepe ndent monetary policy and free capital flows. Under the new trilemma - the holy tr inity - no country can afford to sacrifice any of the objectives as the feedback l oops can quickly shift the economy from an equilibrium to a disequilibrium. The issue really is of managing the inter se prioritization among the objectives and of de termining the role of the central bank in this management.   70. So, how best can we manage the new trilemma? The crisis has given us valuable lessons from practice. We also have assorted bits of theory. The task  26ahead is to put them together into a coherent, workable theory of the new trilemma. I hope this conference will ta ke us closer to that.   71. A final thought, which is actually an extension of what I said at our last conference. In his best-selling book, \u2018The Ascent of Money\u2019, Niall Ferguson says that sometimes the most important histori cal events are the non- events: the things that did not happen. From that perspectiv e, that the Great Recession did not turn into the second Great Depression, as we  had feared, will count as a major non-event, notwithstanding the de pth and duration of this rece ssion. If the euro survives the sovereign debt crisis, as we hope, it wi ll be another spectac ular non-event. Non-events they may be, but they have cha nged our thinking on central bank mandates in a powerful way. How influential that thinking will be on the way forward will depend on how firmly central ba nks embrace the new trilemma.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- -- - - - - -   References  Chancellor, Edward (2011) : \u201cGermany\u2019s Eurozone trilemma\u201d, Financial Times, November 6, 2011.

Republished with permission from Wall Street Journal) Reserve Bank of India Gov. Duvvuri Subbarao sat down with The Wall Street Journal to talk about his efforts to restart Indi a's growth engine and to fight persistent inflation. Speaking from the 18th floor of the Reserve Bank headquarters ov erlooking Mumbai, Mr. Subbaro touched on a range of is sues, including the RBI's efforts to stabilize the plungi ng rupee in late 2011, his calls for cuts to government spending, and how it was difficult to  increase interest rates several times over the objec tion of a panel of advisors.  Follows is an edited transcript of the conversation: WSJ: What is your monetary policy stance ri ght now, are you easing credit conditions or are you in neutral? SUBBARAO: It's difficult to say what is neutra l. But we give guidance in our quarterly policy statements in October and again in Janu ary, which is to say that the tightening has peaked, and from here onwards, it's that we've got  to come down, that we have to start easing. There was some question as whether the CRR (cash reserve ratio)  cut we had done in the January policy was a signal of easing. It depends on how you interpret th at. But historically the Reserve Bank has viewed the CRR as a mone tary policy instrument with of course liquidity dimensions. So it was both to signal that the interest rate cycle has peaked and also to infuse liquidity.  WSJ: So was it easing or not? SUBBARAO: I would say it was ea sing to the extent we had eased the liquidity situation and we viewed the CRR as a monetary policy instrument.  WSJ: You got applause for holding the government's  feet to fire on the growth in the fiscal deficit in your January policy st atement, saying such spending is  fueling inflation. You have talked about this issue in the past, but never so pointedl y. Critics say you should have done so earlier. What's your response?  SUBBARAO: If you see our monetary policy st atements over the past two years, we've consistently drawn attention to the fiscal deficit concerns having recognized that some stimulus was of course necessary  as part of the crisis manage ment. However we thought that this was an appropriate time this time around to call a more pointed atte ntion to this, because this year, the current fiscal year, the fiscal deficit has breached the initial budget estimate and there area lot of expenditure demands piling up as we see from the newspapers. So we thought it important to call attentio n to the inflationary dimensions  of fiscal deficit, inasmuch as we have combating inflation over the past two years. To summarize, we did call attention to our concerns to fiscal deficit but did so more pointedly this time around because it was a more appropriate and more opportune time to do that. WSJ: Governments generally are not known to be disciplined on spending in election years and there are several large stat e elections in India this year . What if they don't heed your advice on spending because of election year pressures.  SUBBARAO: Not just me, there are lots of other people talking about the negative repercussions of fiscal deficits. And I think these negative repercussions will show up more pointedly if the government does not make credib le and sizeable fiscal adjustment. For one, the battle against inflation will become that more difficult. Second private credit will get crowded out. There are lots of people who say fi scal deficits in India have not crowded out private credit in the past. That may well be true to some extent  because fiscal deficits have ballooned with private credit demand was low. But now is time when we want private credit demand to pick up and supply to flow. So that w ould be hurt. And third, the twin deficits of current account and fiscal deficits feed on each  other. The maneuverability or the room for not making fiscal adjustments is very limited if not nonexistent.  WSJ: What specific things w ould do think are advisable adjustments to make. Readers see the term fiscal consolidation, but  what does that mean exactly? SUBBARAO: The only discretionar y expenditure they can make in the short term is on subsidies. And there is I believe quite a str ong case for making adjustments on subsidies even from the anti-poverty perspective. That said, I'd like to comment on some principles apart from specifics. The finance minist er will of course come out w ith a budget estimate for fiscal deficit for next year in the budget. Beyond th at I think he should indicate a roadmap, a medium term roadmap for fiscal deficit, whic h they've done in the past and there's a big probability he will do that. I think he should back  that up with a credible plan of how it's going to be achieved. Second, I think we also mu st rely also on expenditure compression in addition to tax increases to build  the fiscal adjustment. And thir d, there must be some focus on the quality of fiscal adjustment, because if  you are chasing just the number, it's possible that you would prune out produc tive expenditure and retain unproductive expenditure.  WSJ: You mentioned some subsidy cuts w ould be good for anti-poverty programs. Which ones? SUBBARAO: If there is subsidy in LPG (liquefi ed petroleum gas), it's a subsidy that's not going to the poor. It's a subsidy that's going to people who can a fford LPG, which is certainly not the poor. Power subsidies are given by st ate governments according to people who have land, whereas the landless, who are poorer, don't get any subsidy at all. There's got to be some attention paid to the poverty impact of subsidies and targeting su bsidies with an anti-poverty focus.  WSJ: It seems all the parties in the state el ection in Uttar Pradesh are campaigning to give away free power. That sort of thing would seem to make it hard to cu t spending in the coming year. SUBBARAO: Yes. Sometimes there is concern of how much of a democracy tax we are paying. WSJ: You said in last policy statement you w ould be constrained from lowering rates unless there's credible fiscal cons olidation. The budget is presente d March 16, whereas your meeting is March 15. For a March 15 meeting, is a rate cut still an op tion given any plan for fiscal consolidation would be presented a day later. SUBBARAO: We didn't have a precise date when we  said that. But I can't really speculate on what this off the table on the table for the next  policy review. Theoretica lly all options are on the table. WSJ: Some critics say you were n't aggressive enough with rate increases in the beginning of the cycle and some say you were too aggres sive in the end and some say both. Which criticism are you more  comfortable with? SUBBARAO: Criticism is part of the ga me when you are making public policy. It's legitimate that people criticize. And I'm comfortable that the cri ticism comes from both sides, which must mean we are at least partly right, that some people think we are right. But I must enter some explanation of our unrolling of our tightening over the past two years. One criticism as you mentioned that it was back lo aded, that we were sleeping at the wheel and then woke up. That's not the case. The baby step  approach that it's come to be called, was justified on three grounds. Firs t, inflation was stemming at that time from supply shocks. There were demand pressures but they were very insipient at that time. Second, we had to support recovery. Around the world there was st ill the depth of recession and here at home we had to support recovery. And rates had come to historically low levels as part of the crisis management and we couldn't raise them abruptly, so  it had to be a calibr ated process. So even with the benefit of hindsight, I believe we ca librated the policy stance quite well. The last point I want to make is there' s no counterfactual. It's not clear  that inflation would not have been much higher if we had not acted. I'd say we are quite comfortable with our criticism, but I believe that our baby step appro ach for much of 2010 was justified.  WSJ: Wasn't it your respons ibility to raise rates earlier in or der for the government to realize spending was a problem earlier? Your job is pr ice stability and it doesn't matter what the cause is, you need to tackle it. SUBBARAO: You certainly need to tackle it but you can't do public policy to teach a lesson or to spite someone. You've got  to coordinate with the government and there was a fiscal stimulus as part of the crisis and it certain ly would take time to wind that down. We were quite sensitive to that. I don't think it would ha ve been appropriate for the Reserve Bank to raise rates regardless of what gove rnment was doing just to tell them that the ball was in their court. I don't think that would have been appropriate.  WSJ: People in market are saying measures to ma intain liquidity in the financial system such as your OMO (open market operations) and CRR ( cash reserve ratio) cut are the only thing supporting government bond yi elds at these levels. SUBBARAO: That's one perspective. But you must also recognize that we had said that we'd like liquidity to be within one 1% of NDTL (A  measure of liquidity). The last few months, it's been way above that. From a purely liquidity  management perspective, we were acting by the guidelines we had given to the market. The question is whether this is supporting government borrowing. When we introduced liquidity  for it to be within our targeted range, no destination for that money is indicated. It's  for the banks to choose to lend to the government or the private sector. It's not as if we were telling banks to lend to the government.  WSJ: India even at 7% has GDP growth is a very good number globally. But there's a lot of disillusionment in the last year or two from  companies. How do you se e India portrayed and does it feel different from 2007- 2008. Has there been cooling of enthusiasm for the India economic story?  SUBBARAO: Certainly there is a feeling that the economy has sl owed down and that it was a slowdown that could have been avoided that we need not have come down to 7% if both the external world as well as domestic policy situati on had been better. Firs t, of course is the monetary tightening and the high inte rest rates, but that's just one  factor. There's been a lot of uncertainty about policy in Delhi and getting projects going at the field level in terms of land, power, all the permissions, all the clearances y ou need to get, which are not so much Delhi focused but at the field level and certainly a bout the slowdown in second generation reforms.  WSJ: Any change in economic outlook given the reduced jitter s from Europe, the austerity plan passed in Greece overnight, more hope about the U.S. economy?  SUBBARAO: Something happened as we turned  the calendar from 2011 to 2012. The fears of imminent collapse two months before Chri stmas have certainly waned. In Europe the LTRO performed better even than  the ECB hoped, I think. Then th ere is the fiscal compact. There is still concerns about short term f unding and still concern about whether the banks will be able to raise th e capital. There's less of a concer n about an event shock, but still concern about process shocks as we go along and Greece and other countries have to roll over their debt. And the firewalls they wanted to bu ild have to some extent succeeded in showing that Greece is different from ot her 'PIIGS' countries. That's cer tainly had a positive impact on investor sentiment here. Although our exposure to  Europe is not domi nant, it's certainly significant. To the extent that Europe seems to  be less unstable today, it does help domestic investor sentiment here too and we've s een that on all the market indices.  WSJ: What makes India so vulnera ble to global financial markets, as we saw last fall with rupee falling during the worst of the euro me ss. What can you do and what can India do to make sure the next time the effect is less severe? SUBBARAO: All emerging economy currencies have depreciated in the pre-Christmas months, but Indian rupee depreci ated more than other currenci es. All of you wrote and as we know the rupee was worst performing currency in the world or whatever. What explains that is that we are a current  account deficit economy. South Africa  too is current account deficit. Those emerging economies that had a surplus or a small deficit were less hit than countries that have a sizeable deficit like India, and th at deficit was growing. So the rupee depreciation was a result of external flows practically thinning out and driven by the dynamics of the current account deficit.  What can the reserve bank do, we've in fact done what we could do which was to curb speculation in the market and to encourage capital flows of a more stable nature but there are limits to that. All the things we've done to rais e deregulate interest rates on NRI (non-resident Indian) rupee deposits, on raising the limits on F II (foreign investor) exposure to equity and debt markets and curbing speculation. But even tually we need to make the balance of payments more robust to inspire confidence. Ther e it's quite clear. We need to diversify our export destinations and product mix.  As far as imports are concerned, we need to  reduce the dependence on  oil imports and one way to do that is to deregulate petroleum pr oduct prices. Gold imports of course have increased partly as a reflection of a safe have n. We need to provide other safe havens. We need to attract more stable flows. FDI for example and fina lly we must within the RBI encourage, if not pressurize ou r corporates to hedge their fo reign exchange exposures. They don't do that adequately. They do cost benefit cal culations, if the rupee is not moving rapidly, they calculate the cost of hedgi ng is higher than the risk they  take by not taking. But as happened in the pre-Christmas months, it can certainly overshoot, so we'd like corproates to hedge more. But not proscribe that, we want to  leave it to the banks and the corporates. WSJ: When you lifted foreign investor quotas and non-resident deposit rates last year, it brought in capital and helped the rupee. Wa s it something you were going to do anyway? At your core, do you want India's markets to be more open or do you like the protection that exists? SUBBARAO: I'd like our capital account to be more open and these are measures we should be taken. Of course we took them under some sort  of pressure so the interpretation that you made is quite appropriate that maybe these are cr isis driven measures, but certainly they were on our road map of liberalizing further.  WSJ: So were you taking advantage of a crisis? SUBBARAO: In a way it was timed as such, bu t even otherwise we w ould have done them sometime.  WSJ: Do you see currency  volatility continuing?  SUBBARAO: I cannot really speculate on how th e currency will move. That's dependant on a number of factors. But certainly I'd like to see less volatility in the market in the currency movement and less of a need for the reserve ba nk to intervene so that the exchange rate is determined by forces of supply and demand. A nd yes, when we are a stronger economy, when capital flows are of a stable nature are co ming, the exchange rate wi ll be subject to less volatility. And again, that will be an appropria te platform for taking further capital account reforms.  WSJ: With the rupee a bit more stable ar ound 49, is now a good time to build reserves? SUBBARAO, I can't speculate that but we  had used some reserves certainly. WSJ: Given the thirst globally for emerging ma rket debt, why not open India even more to foreign investors.  SUBBARAO: Certainly we would like more FII (f oreign institutional inve stors) in corporate debt but you must recognize that  even the existing limit is not used up. There is something out there we have to fi x about the appetite for the corporat e bond market. It's not a restriction placed on the capital account front. As far as F II on government debt, yes certainly, we have expanded that quite rapidly in the last three or  four years, but there is need for going a bit more cautiously, because as we've seen during th e crisis, countries with  large sovereign debt exposure to foreigners suffered destabilizing vola tility. So we need to balance the concerns of stability with concerns of less expensive foreign flows.  WSJ: When you take over in 2008 did you make a conscious decision to take a more hand's off approach when it comes to foreign exchange interventions? SUBBARAO: That's a judgment outsi ders will have to make. By inclination, I believe that markets should be allowed to function and th at we should minimize our intervention and that's good for building the resilience of the economy.  WSJ: But it does help on the monetary policy side, as a flexible exchange rate makes your interest rate policy more potent? SUBBARAO: Certainly. That's very fresh in my mind. I gave a speech last week on the impossible trinity, so to the extent you have a freely floating exchange rate you have greater, more independent monetary policy.  WSJ: Are you satisfied with the intervention you undertook last year on the foreign exchange market? SUBBARAO: Yes. I would think so, especia lly on speculation. If you don't intervene, the speculative forces could be self reinforcing whic h is that exporters would defer bringing their receipts in and importers woul d buy forwards. That's a self-reinforcing feedback loop. To the extent that we curbed speculation and showed  that determination, it certainly helped.  WSJ: So 54 rupees to the dollar wa s a level you weren't comfortable? SUBBARAO: I can't really comment on a specific  exchange rate. We were looking at the first derivative, not the stock figure,  but the rate at which it was going. WSJ: Are these foreign exchange measures  temporary, do they fit in you capital account liberalization trajectory? SUBBARAO: Some of them do  fit in with our capital account thinking. Some of the measures to curb speculation, th ey are permanent until removed, but that's not saying much. We'd have to take a view on speculative tenden cies and if we believ e we are robust enough and there's no scope for speculation we will ro ll them back, but that's no indication that rollback is on the radar screen.  WSJ: Oil prices remain elevated, a major con cern for you, as mentioned in the latest policy statement. How will you deal with that if they persist? SUBBARAO: Oil prices are a big factor a nd largely beyond our control and are very complex economic and geopolitical factors that drive oil prices. Just  looking at the world situation, the U.S. growth situation is quite mo dest and Europe is probably in a recession and Japan is growing but you know. Oil prices should have come down or should have been much lower than they are today. Evidently ther e is something going on there that is keeping pressures up. Partly it's liquidity. Even the LTRO [the European Ce ntral Bank's long-term refinancing operation] money, it's not clear it's being used all in Europe and some of it is being used in speculation. And then there are the political factors, which is Iran. If Iran is outside the world pool there coul d be price pressures. If Saudi Arabia because of fiscal concerns, its commitment to extend fiscal sup ports to other Arab countries, to meet that commitment they might want to keep oil prices  at a certain level. There's economic factors, there's political factors there are market factors,  all of them that determine oil prices which are largely out of control. Inasmuch as we impor t 80% of our oil and more  than a third of our imports, so oil prices are a big factor for infl ation management, for the fiscal deficit and for macroeconomic stability for the country.  WSJ: Does that make India's relationship with Iran and this deal to pay for oil with rupees, how critical is that? Do you talk a bout the central government about this? SUBBARAO: We are conforming to the U.N. sanc tions as far as dealings with Iran are concerned. And U.N. sanctions do not prohibit purchases of o il from Iran. As much as we purchase oil from Iran, we've got to find a way to pay for it and our effort has been to continue to make our payments.  WSJ: How do you see growth for the 2013 fiscal year, starting in March 2012?  SUBBARAO: We expect growth to  be higher in 2013 than in 2012, partly becau se at some point in time we might start easing the interest rate cycle. Partly  because the external situation will be more stable. The world recovery will pick up. And I'm hoping that a confluence of factors, including the sentiment factor that is inhibiting investment will have run out, and that positive sentiment will revive. Animal spirits will come back into play.  WSJ: What about inflation. Why do you feel conf ident enough to talk so openly about cutting rates?  SUBBARAO: I think inflation should start coming down. The decline we've seen in November and December is largely to food prices , within food to vegetable prices. But we've also seen demand pressures easing. We've s een a decline in non-f ood manufactured product inflation, which is our measure of core infla tion, which I believe peaked some months ago. We've seen pricing power of co rporates coming down. And growth itself, if it moderates to 7%, which means both investment and consump tion pressures are lower. I believe it will come down through fiscal year 2013, but at a gradual pace.  WSJ: How would you rate your perfor mance as central bank governor? SUBBARAO: I think it's inappropriate for me to make a mid-career judgment on my career but it's for others to make a judgment. I've ha d enormous challenges, very difficult situations, but the reserve bank is a great institutions, I've had tremendous intellectual support and advice which I hope has steered th e country throu gh challenges. WSJ: Speaking of that advice, the technical advisory committee, you haven't seen eye-to-eye with them on the pace of rate increases, why are you not agreeing? SUBBARAO: We have enormous respect for what the TAC has to say and for the last, let's say the second half of calendar 2011, when we continued to raise rates, many of our TAC members had expressed concerns about inflation, but had advised that we must pause but without any explanation about how inflati on would come down unless we had acted. We weighted their advice against our own judgment and acted as we  did. I do hope we get some credit for putting it out in the public domain.  WSJ: How difficult was it to make those d ecisions with the comm ittee so close to you disagreeing? SUBBARAO: It's difficult. It's certainly so mething you don't do lightheartedly. You do think twice before going against their advice.  WSJ: You've mentioned being more open, talki ng to the press and analysts and publishing minutes. What's your inspiration for that and why do you think it's better for the deliberations to be more open rather than guarded? SUBBARAO: I was wondering whether it's more to do with my l eadership or my personality style. Communicating with the market a nd communicating openly does help get the appropriate feedback and getti ng a reality check on what you ar e doing. There are of course certain times and certain things you have to keep confidential and be unpredictable, but we try to minimize that. I expect that you'll be roughly  right as Keynes sai d, and precisely wrong. WSJ: Can you talk about the hea lth of the banking system. Some  see a deleveraging process going on, higher nonperforming loans and the fiscal  situation on the government side makes it difficult to recapitalize the state owned ba nks. How concerned are you about the banks?  SUBBARAO: NPLs (Non-performing loans) have grown and have grown quite rapidly in the second half of 2011 calendar year, and that's par tly to be expected when the economy is not growing that fast and when restructuring had been done during the crisis. The incidence of impaired assets out of restructuring would certa inly be higher than the overall sample. But we've done stress tests, and they show that our  banks will remain profitable and will have no capital concerns even under fairly significant st ress in terms of the some of the restructured assets turning into non performing assets. Still th at's a concern, and it's part of our regulation and supervision process and looking into th at and advising banks to improve on their portfolio situation.  WSJ: People get very worked up about growth be ing as low as 6.9%. Historically that's high, but on flipside, that level is such an elastic  economy there's so mu ch catching up to do, anything less than 5% is practically recession ary. Where's your level? How good a number is 7%? SUBBARAO: For India to come down from 9% to  7% is as difficult an adjustment to make as for the U.S. to come down from 2% to 0%, when your growth rate falls rapidly. What is our potential growth rate, noninfla tionary stable growth  rate? We said before the crisis it was 8.5%. After the crisis, some studi es showed it was about 8%. Bu t now we've seen inflation, even when the economy was growing at 7.5%, i ndicating the noninflationary growth rate is about 7% or so. But that is not destiny and that  we are not locked into a 7% growth rate. We should certainly accelerate that , and it's certainly possible to do that, but for that, supply responses must come.  WSJ: If you could wave your magic wand on the Indian economy, what structural impediment in the Indian economy would you want fixed, improved FDI, balance of payments, investment growth?  SUBBARAO: I think public finance reform. All the things you mentioned are equally important and unlikely to work in isolation. But I'd think pub lic finance reform at both the central and state governments would go a long wa y in providing a platform for all the other reforms to take off.  WSJ: What about reforming the RBI. It's a ve ry big organization. You manage interest rate policy and are in charge of issuing government de bt, which some see as a conflict of interest as your incentives might be to keep borrowi ng costs low for the government when inflation argues for higher rates. Should that change? SUBBARAO: I believe not. The RBI has a much  wider mandate than most other central banks. We are the monetary authority and issu er of currency, but we are the regulator and supervisor of banks, financial markets and nonba nks, the external sector we are responsible for, and we have a huge development mandate. That's served the country quite well.  In particular about the debt management, as to  whether that should be hived off from the RBI. The case for that was to made on the ground that  there was a conflict of interest for the Reserve Bank to do debt management, because it interferes with m onetary policy. Second, that the fiscal deficit was on the way down, ther efore there is possibility for an independent debt management office. I think both those argument s have lost part or most of their validity. I believe there is a quite a bit of synergy for the RBI to be doing the debt management, because raising resources of the size the govern ment does in India, is  not just a matter or raising resources, it has implications for interest rates, for liquidity for credit flow and for the macro economic situation. Given that fiscal de ficits and government borrowing are so high, I think there is quite a bit of synergy between a central policy which is  charge of monetary policy which is also doing debt management? WSJ: What's the synergy, that you not issue debt? SUBBARAO: No. That's not an option. That we can ensure, that as much as the government has to borrow, that there is sufficient liquid ity so the private sect or crowding out is minimized. We can ensure that th e interest rates are still manageable and competitive for the private sector. And also recognize that the conf lict of interest angle is somewhat overplayed. When 70% of the banking sector is with the governm ent, there is a conflict of interest if debt management is done by an office that has some affiliation with the government.  I don't think we will use our function as the debt manager to put pressure on the government about the fiscal deficit. There are other avenues to pressure and to argue our case. As far as debt management is concerned, we want  to be efficient debt managers.  WSJ: How much does China, as India's larg est trading partner, weigh on your economic analysis?  SUBBARAO: Perhaps we reckon with that possi bly less than we should be doing. Our trade with China is growing, our links with China are growing and we've allowed corporates to raise debt in yuan. I think Chinese economic  management, particularly their economic policies should be part of our reckoning more than it is now.  WSJ: You were recently reappointed for anot her two year term, running out in September 2013. Would you like to serve after that? SUBBARAO: No.   The Transcript can also be viewed at   http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204795304577221253451295374.html ", "22 Nov 11 MP.pdf": " The Challenge of Food Inflation1 - Duvvuri Subbarao \u00a0  First of all, my thanks to the Indi an Society of Agricultural Marketing, particularly to Prof. Radhakrishna, the President, and Prof. Satyanarayana,  Secretary of the Society for inviting me to  address this conference.  Speaking to a gathering of distinguished agricultural economists is an  opportunity to which I attach a lot of value.  Whenever I am invited to speak, I struggle to determine a topic that is relevant to th e organizers, and is also with in the domain of the Reserve Bank.  In this instance though, I did not have any problem since there is a vast subject area that is of mutual interest to the Reserve Bank and to agricultural economists, particularly economists with  sub-specialization in agricultural marketing.  For today, I have chosen to speak on the challeng e of food inflation.  I.The Context 2. Persistent and elevated food inflation over the last few years has emerged as a major policy concern, especially as it  can potentially threaten our collective aspiration for a \u2018higher, inclusive and su stainable\u2019 growth.  Intriguingly, we are experiencing high food inflation in the face of record production of food grains, robust buffer stocks and growing resilience of agriculture to monsoon uncertainties.                                                  1 Presidential Address delivered by Dr. Duvvuri Subba rao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the 25th Annual Conference of the Indian Society of Agricultur al Marketing at Hyderabad on November 22, 2011.   Evidently, the dynamics of food infla tion have changed significantly, and understanding them is obviously important for a policy response.    3. A related question that has engaged economists has been the role, if any, of the central bank in combating food inflation. Opinion on this has spanned the entire spectrum.  At one end is the view that m onetary policy should be the \u2018first line of defence\u2019 no matter what the drivers of infla tion.  At the other end is the view that monetary policy is an inappropriate instrumentality to address supply pressures, and that the central bank should adopt a \u2018h ands off\u2019 approach.  Real world, as we know, is too complex for such binary text  book prescriptions; management of food inflation has always been a complex ch allenge for the Reserve Bank, both by way of policy action and its communication.    4. What I propose to do in th is address is to first highlight the trends in food inflation over the past 60 years.  Having t hus set the context, I will turn to factors driving structural food in flation, which should give us a perspective of the underlying dynamics and the nature of the challenge.  I will then move on to indicating the policy measures for addressi ng the  challenge of  food inflation on a durable basis.  I will, in the end, address an issue more directly relevant to the Reserve Bank \u2013 the role of monetary  policy in the face of supply shocks.  II.   Trends in Food Inflation over last Six Decades 5. An assessment of the inflation trends  over last six decades indicates that India has encountered successive bouts of high food inflation, but the underlying drivers have changed over time;the infl uence of monsoon has declined and some new sources of price pressures have emerge d. What is particularly notable is that during the 2000s, average food inflation fe ll significantly [Chart-1].In contrast, since 2008-09 (i.e. about last three and half years), average food inflation has been higherthan the average food inflation in each of the past six decades.  This cannot all be attributed to poor m onsoon.  Sure, rainfall was deficient in 2009, but so was it in 2002 and 2004.   But, in the earlier years, food infl ation remained modest, at less than three per cent over three successive years dur ing 2002-05 whereas it shot up to double digits in 2009.What has changed in recent years to cause sustained price pressures? This is the big question we need to answer to find a durable solution to food inflation.    III.   Factors Driving Food Price Pressures 6. What are the factors driving food  inflation? I would emphasize the following: (i) shift in dietar y habits towards protein foods ; (ii) pressu re stemming from inclusive growth policie s; (iii) large incr eases in MSPs of foodgrains; (iv) shocks from global food inflation; and (v) financialisation of commodities.  Let me take them up one by one.  (i) Shift in Dietary Habits  Towards Protein Foods 7. A distinct feature of recent food price inflation has been the sustained price pressure in protein rich items (pulses, milk, fish, meat and eggs). Inflation in protein rich items has generally exceeded both headline (WPI) inflation and inflation in primary food articles [Chart-2].    8. As one would expect, the share of f ood in total expenditure has declined over successive rounds of NSSO surveys al ongside increases in per capita income, consistent with Engel\u2019s Law [Chart-3].      9. We need to turn to the lesser known Bennet\u2019s Law for an explanation of food inflation.  Bennet\u2019s Law suggests that as incomes increase, the proportion of starchy staples in the food ba sket declines rela tive to the share of more expensive sources of calories. Recent NSSO data showing a significant increase in the share of protein rich items in total food expenditure, both in rural and urban areas, confirm this hypothesis [Chart-4].  T hough protein inflation, reflecting changing dietary habits, was evident earlier as well, the pace of increase has been sharperin recent years reflecting,in pa rt, accelerated increases in nominal wages.      Chart - 4: Shares of Various compon ents in Total Food Expenditure                       10. Even in the face of such structural ch anges in dietary habits, inflation is not inevitable.  The reason structural changes have triggered inflation in India is that the supply response in respect of most pr otein items has not been adequate. With the exception of pulses, other protein rich  items are not crop products. This is an important point since it expl ains the growing disconnect  between the performance of agriculture and the traject ory of food inflation.     (ii) Pressure on Food Inflation Stemming from Inclusive Growth 11. Unlike the growth-inflation tradeoff, the possible tradeoff between inclusive growth and inflation has not received much  attention. The need for making growth inclusive is incontestable, but it is impor tant to recognize that policies aimed at inclusion can stoke inflationa ry pressures, at any rate in the short-term. I could mention two examples here:first, the signifi cant increase in rural wages triggered by the MGNREGS, and second, inflationary  implications of th e proposed Food Security Bill.   12. The MGNREGS, guaranteeing at least one hundred days of wage employment to rural labour, in implem entation since February 2006, has pushed up rural wages, in line with the expected outcomes of the scheme.  The indexation of the wage rate to CPI-AL since the beginning of 2011 has exacerbated the wage-price inflation spiral.  NSSO survey da ta (61st Round and 66th Round) suggest that nominal wages of workers, in both rural a nd urban areas, increased much faster in the second half of the 2000s than in the firs t half. In most states, wageshave increased faster thanCPI-RL inflatio n,pushing up real wages [Chart-5].      13. Consistent with the characteristic of a low income country, increase in wages in India has quickly translated to increase in per capita expenditure.  Average nominal per capita expenditure incr eased sharply in the second half of the decade (2005-10) compared to the first half (2000-05), rising from 3.6 per cent per annum to 10.5 per cent in rural areas, a nd 5.3 per cent per annum to 10.9 per cent in urban areas.  The MGNREGS has evidently se t the floor for the rural wage level, making wage push inflation more visible and prominent.  Admittedly, increase in wages need not be inflationary provided it reflects higher produc tivity, but that is not currently the case, a point to which I will return later. 14. The National Food Security Bill, 2011 is another potential source of pressure on inflation, and its inflationary impact will depend on the extent to which it will raise demand for food grains rela tive to the normal increase in supply. The proposed billtargets two categ ories of households - priority households and general households - under which 75 per cent of th e rural population (with  at least 46 per cent of the population belonging to priori ty households) and 50 per cent of the urban population (with at leas t 28 per cent of the population belong ing to priority households) will become entitled to subsid ized food grains. The price restrictions are quite exacting and failure by the govern ment to meet the obligations entails payment of a food security a llowance to the beneficiary. 15. Estimates suggest that 68 per cent of the country\u2019s 1.2 billion population will get a legal entitlement for food grains after the bill is enacted, significantly raising the annual grain procurement demand even as the available marketed surplus would not increase correspondingly.  This will create demand pressures, which will inevitably spillover to market prices of food grains.  Furthermore, the higher food subsidy burden on the budget wi ll raise the fiscal deficit, exacerbating macro level inflationary pressures. (iii) Large Increases in MSPs of Food Grains 16. Recent years have witnessed a sign ificant increase in minimum support prices (MSP) of several agricultural comm odities, pushing up food inflation. This is particularly evident from the neatly anc hored co-movement of market prices and MSPs for rice and wheat [Chart-6].  Th e Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) has typically followed a cost plus pricing formula for determining the MSP, and in an environment of risi ng wages and increasing input costs, rising MSPs have accentuated inflation pressures.   Chart - 6: Higher Minimum Support Prices (MSPs)  Drag Market Prices Up  Rice Price vs. MSP Wheat Price vs. MSP   17. Compared with the past, hikes in MSPs  for wheat and rice have been more substantial in recent years, as the following table shows.          Annual Average Percentage Increase in MSP                         2002-07          2007-12  Rice   1.8  13.6 Wheat   4.0  11.9   18. Given the cost plus formula for the determination of MSPs, the increase in MSPs as above is consistent with the rising input costs as evidenced by figures below. Percentage Increase in Agricultural Input Prices   2008/09   2009/10  2010/11  Inputs  3%- 19% 18% - 28% 3% -19% Wages   9%- 36%  5% - 30% 18%-43%  Inputs: Fodder, diesel oil, lubricants, fertilizer and pesticides   19. It is a fair presumption that MGNR EGS has considerably  affected labour costs while also tightening availability of  agricultural labour during peak seasons. Given that Indian agriculture is labour intensive, sustai ned wage pressures can keep food price inflation high even  in years of reco rd food production as was the case in 2010-11.    (iv) Shocks from Global Food Inflation 20. Given India\u2019s growing integration with the world economy, global food prices affect our domestic prices even if there is no trade.   Global food price pressures have been quite acute in r ecent years reflecting growing demand and a weak supply response.  Demand side pr essures have stemmed from growing population and rising incomes.  Supply side pressure have  been triggered by a host of factors - increasing ur banization, diversion of la nd for bio-fuel production, inadequate investment in research and tec hnology, spikes in costs of inputs such as diesel and fertilizer and disturbances arising from climate change. The impact of these factors underpinning high food pric es was amplified further by country specific policy interventions, particularly  export bans on specific commodities by certain countries. Import barriers in so me countries to prot ect domestic producers and large subsidies to farm production in  several advanced economies have also influenced the supply response of farm output to distorted price signals.   21. According to an assessment by OECD-FAO, global food inflation situation will remain grim over the next ten years. It is important to note that prices of food items actually declined in real terms over several decades from early 1960s to early 2000 [Chart-7].  This trend began to be reversed, gradually during 2003-06, and rapidly thereafter up until the 2008 global fi nancial crisis. After some moderation in 2009, food prices have again edged up, te nding closer to pre-crisis peaks. The OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2011-20 indi cates that prices may be higher in real terms over the five y ears 2015-20, relative to the le vels prevailing during the five year period 1998-2003 by 40 per cent in case of rice, 27 per cent for wheat, 48 per cent for maize and 36 per cent for oil seeds. What the above global outlook clearly suggests is that we will not get any comfort from the global situation in managing our food inflation.        22. Even in a situation of low global pr ices, India does not enjoy the import option given the huge size of our consum ption. Global food markets are notoriously thin, and even the mere signal of a larg e consumer like India entering the market can spike up prices.  Moreover, in some commodities such as rice, Indian prices have been lower than global prices [Chart -8] suggesting that even if imports could expand domestic supply, they would not soften inflationary pressures.       Chart - 8: Limited Import Option Comparison of Domestic and Internat ional Food Prices (US$ per tn.)    Source: FAO Food Price Database    (v) Financialisation of Commodities  - A New Source of Price Pressure 23. Some analysts contend that speculation in commodity futures has been a key driver of global food inflation in r ecent years. In general,there has been a marked increase in financial investment in commodity markets, relative to both global GDP and physical commodity produc tion.  Do activities in commodity futures market reflect genuine needs of hedging?Does speculation systematically influence the commodity prices and lead to increased price volatility? These are questions that are as yet la rgely unsettled in academic  and policy discussions. At any rate, the financialisation channel is often perceived to have magnified the impact on prices of the disequilibriu m between demand and supply, thereby weakening the role of fundamentals in the price formation process.   24. In India, prices of several comm odities which are not traded on the commodities exchange, such as fruit and milk, have significantly increased in the recent period. Moreover, certain commodities that were banned for trading in 2007, such as rice, wheat, tur and urad also e xhibited price increases  subsequently. Even after the ban imposed on tr ading of sugar in 2009, suga r prices had increased considerably. Evidence of any relationshi p between futures market activities in commodities and their spot prices is am biguous. Nonetheless, this needs close monitoring and certainly further research.       IV.Addressing the Challenge of Food Inflation 25. Having discussed the sources of food price pressures, let me now turn to how we may respond to the ch allenge of food inflation. (i) Raise Agricultural Productivity  26. The Green Revolution,entailing adop tion of high yieldi ng variety (HYV) seeds in the mid 1960s and the use of the fertilizer-pesticides-irrigation package,resulted in quantum jumps in produc tivity (i.e. output pe r acre), especially of rice and wheat. By the early 1980s, productivity across al l major crops had peaked, but the momentum had slowed thereafter. Consequently, per-capita availability of food grains, especially of rice and wheat, has started declining [Chart-9].  A comparison of crop yields across G-20 countries shows the extent to which India has lagged be hind others [Chart 10].  Chart - 9: Moderating Yield and Per- capita Availability of Food grains Wheat RiceWheat Rice   Chart - 10: India\u2019s Lagging Yield in Food Production Relative to G-20 Countries   27. Even our best productivity achievement s in terms of yields of major crops are way behind world numbers. During 2010-11 , Punjab, with the highest yield in rice, produced 3.8 tonnes per hectare as ag ainst the world average of 4.3 tonnes per hectare. Yield of oilseeds in Tamil Nadu, the highest in India, at 2.1 tonnes per hectare is lower than the US average of 2.7 tonnes per hectare. There are wide variations in productivity levels of crops across states. Unlike food grains where the Green Revolution improved the food secur ity situation, we ar e still not self-sufficient in pulses and edible oilseeds . The demand for other farm products like fruits and vegetables has also been rising significantly faster than supply, putting pressure on food inflation.    28. The growth of agriculture  and allied sector was most impressive during the 6th Five Year Plan period (1980 to 1985) when it peaked at 5.8 per cent.  The annual average agricultural growth rate moderated thereafter as shown in the following table.   Annual Average Agricultural Growth Rate  Plan Period     Growth Rate       ( p e r c e n t a g e )   6th Plan (1980 - 1985)    5.8 7th Plan (1985 - 1990)    3.0 8th Plan (1992 - 1997)    4.8 9th Plan (1997 - 2002)    2.5 10th Plan (2002 - 2007)    2.4 11th Plan (2007 - 2012)    3.2  (in first 4 years)    29. How do we respond to declining growth and moderating productivity improvements?  The overall policy framewor k for agriculture, driven primarily by remunerative prices and subsidized provisi on of inputs, needs to change; the focus would have to shift to produc tivity and selective policy stimulus to items where the supply response has been weak. Public e xpenditure needs to reorient towards building capital infrastructure for agricu lture which in turn  would \u2018crowd-in\u2019 private investment and help realize the full potential of agriculture growth. There has been no major technological breakth rough in agriculture since the Green Revolution of the mid-60s. There have been  achievements in some specific crops such as cotton, basmati rice and maize, but that needs to be broad based. The Green Revolution also needs to penetrate the eastern region, where the yields have generally remained low.   30. Management of climatic concerns is becoming increasingly important given the continuing dependence on rainfed farming, frequent  floodsin eastern India, frost, particularly in north-western India, and heat wa ves and cyclones on the east coast. These climatic changes are likely to significantly increase volatility in agricultural production. Recent large increases  in prices of some items like onion, sugar, vegetables and cotton ar e, at least in part, a result  of seasonal weather related factors, both domestic and external.  (ii) Rethink Price Policy Interventions 31.  Paradoxically, in India, we subsid ize both agricultural inputs and outputs, and we subsidize both producers and consumer s.  There is a case for revisiting the subsidy regime for a number of reasons, including the pressure  it exerts on food inflation. Subsidies on i nputs (fertilizer, electricity, irrigation) to incentivize production and subsidies on output for the PDS system, entail a large fiscal burden [Chart-11]. Over and above the input subsidies, remunerative MSPs and procurement for the public distribution system (PDS) at prices linked to MSP further distort the price situation. There is a moral hazard here like in any subsidy.  A farming sector that depends excessively on input subsidies and cost plus MSPs to raise production does not have much of an  incentive to raise productivity. If the amount spent on subsidies could be divert ed to augment capital formation in agriculture and creation of rural infrastru cture, higher productiv ity would raise the income of farmers while lowering the prices for the consumers.   Chart - 11: Subsidies on Inputs and Output  (as Percentage of GDP)     32. MSPs pose a major policy dilemma. Re munerative prices are necessary to engineer the desired supply response, but hi gher MSPs also lead to higher inflation. A segment of the population could be pr otected against inflation through the subsidized PDS, but depending on the difference between the PDS price and the MSPs at which procurement is made, and the quantity supplie d through PDS, food subsidies could swell.   33. The share of agriculture in GDP has declined significantly (to about 15 %), but a large section of the labour force (a bout 53 %) still depends  on agriculture for its livelihood. If the per-capita income of  those who depend on agriculture has to increase, productivity of agri culture has to increase (so that even without higher food prices, per capita income could increase) and the percentage of labour force depending on agriculture ha s to decline (which w ould require creation of employment opportunities in non-farm activities).   (iii) Improve Supply Chain Management 34. The supply chain through which farm products move to reach the final consumers is a major source of price pressures.  Two initiatives, currently under debate, that could potentially improve the situation are: (a) revamping the PDS to check leakage of food subsidies, and (b ) allowing entry of FDI into multi-brand retailing.  35. Let us take the PDS first. The G overnment\u2019s food management policy has been largely driven by two goals: (a) main taining buffer stocks to deal with food shortages and thereby ensuri ng food security; and (b) prov iding food at subsidized prices to the poor through the PDS. The f ood stocks at any point of time, thus, reflect the end result of additions thr ough procurement and depletions through release for PDS.    36. Management of food stocks is ri ven by a debate between two opposing points of view.  One view is that food stocks  should play a market  stabilization role such that whenever market prices rise significantly, reflecting particularly supply chain manipulation, stocks should be released into the market to soften prices. The opposing view is that use of food stocks to intervene in the market dilutes the role of competitive market forces, and that the Government should instead focus on easing supply chain rigidities.    37. Given the enormous administrative costs of the PDS and its perceived leakages, several alternatives have b een suggested, although none of them is without its specific problems.  By far th e most straightforward is direct cash transfers, but its implementation is cond itional on universal financial inclusion.  Besides, since cash is fungible, the objec tive of distributing food at subsidized prices can potentially be compromised.  Di stribution of food grains with utilization linked to UID is another option, but that  again is conditional on universal UID coverage.  In the event of a switch over to  cash transfers, the supply chain could become even more important in rura l areas, since by mani pulating supply and prices, food dealers could extract a share of th e cash transferred to the beneficiaries.   38. There are also several proposals on  the table for improving supply chain management.  Given that protein food infl ation stems especially from perishable items such as milk, eggs, meat, fish, vege tables and fruits, the case for a better supply chain management becomes stronger.  The most actively discussed option is allowing FDI into multi-brand retail.  The Government\u2019s discussion paper on the subject argues that super market-chains c ould lower costs and increase efficiency because of scale economics.  They will also lead to better safety and quality standards.    39. Evidence from cross-country experien ce on the benefits of multi-brand FDI on inflation is ambiguous.  Several questions persist.  Will the supermarket chains, focusing as they do on urban consumpti on centres for scale of economy reasons, leave the rural popula tion behind?  Also, if there are such clear scale economies and cost advantages, why aren\u2019t domestic  investors jumping in to exploit the potential?  40. Another issue in supply chain manageme nt is reform of some restrictive statutes and regulations.  Ev en as production of vegetabl es and fruits has increased in recent years, around 40 per cent of it goes wa ste between the farm gate and the market for want of cold chain and transpor t infrastructure.   Implementation of the model Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act 2003, which provides for direct marketing, contract farm ing and setting up of markets in private and cooperative sectors is a possibl e option to address this problem.  (iv) Manage Competition for Land From Non-farm Activities  41. Land is the single most important input  for agriculture. Besides being a key determinant of socio-economic status, it provides collateral for credit and for security in the event of na tural hazard or c ontingencies. The supply of land, as we know, is fixed. Over the years, there has be en a significant change in the pattern of land use. Net sown area, which increased at a rate of 18 per cent during 1951-71, has either declined or remained stagnant  since then. Increased cropping intensity over the years, however, has led to an in crease in gross cropped area, though at a slowing pace in recent decades. As a resu lt, there has been no significant increase in the share of net cropp ed area in total geograph ical area since the 1970s.   42. A notable aspect of the changing la nd use pattern is th at the share of cultivable land not used for agricultural purposes has increased from a low of 2.8 per cent of the total geographical areas in 1950-51 to 7.5 per cent in 2004-05. This may be indicative of increas ed diversion of agricultur al land for non-agricultural purposes, such as urbanization, housing, industr ialization, and infrastructure. It is a fair presumption that such diversion w ould have further gained pace since 2004-05.  Land acquisition for industrial and other comm ercial uses is an issue that has been headline news in recent years;  clearly, it is an emotiv e issue involving difficult tradeoffs.  No matter how the tradeoffs are resolved, the reality of increasing demand for land from fast growing and mo re productive sectors cannot be ignored. The possibility of declining arable land available for cultiv ation underscores the importance of increasing pr oductivity if we are to contain food inflationary pressures.  43. There are several other problems.  Fi rst, land holding in  India is highly fragmented, with marginal holdings (of one  hectare or less) accounting for as high as 62 per cent of all operational holdings. The small farm size in a labour surplus agrarian sector leads to intensive use of land,but in the absence of supporting infrastructure and capacity to access modern technology and inputs, productivity remains low.  Second, rainfed agriculture c onstitutes as much as  55 per cent of the cropped area and 45 per cent of the total agri cultural output. More  than 70 per cent of pulses and oilseeds production as well as a substantial part of horticulture and animal husbandry produce is from rainfed farming, underscoring significant continuing monsoon dependence.  Third, water is  going to be as precious as land in the long-run, and costs of irrigation will increase significantly, not only in terms of the actual cost of access to the irrigati on facility, but also by way of costs arising from competing demand from non-agricul ture sectors for the limited supply of water. Fourth, dry land farming would have to receive greater attention, but there will be greater competition even for dry lands from urbanization and infrastructure.   V.Monetary Policy and Inflation  44. Now let me turn to a question that is more directly relevant to the Reserve Bank - what is the role of a central bank in combating f ood inflation?  As I said earlier, the answer to this question spans the entire spectrum.  45. That monetary policy should respond if  there is inflation, meaning there is sustained increase in the general price level, is beyond question.  But high food prices often result from a dverse supply shocks or large increases in input costs.  The conventional wisdom is that if inflation expect ations are well anchored, monetary policy need not react to suppl y shocks. This premise is based on the assumption that the supply shocks are purely temporary. This assumption does not always hold. In the real world, oftentimes supply shocks are struct ural and lead to a permanent trend upward shift in prices.    46. So, the challenge for a central bank is  to determine if the supply shock is temporary or permanent.  If it is perman ent, then the change in relative prices caused by it can result in higher general inflation, in the first round by the higher input costs, and in the second round th rough the impact on inflation expectation and wage bargaining.  In other words, when supply shocks impact the trend or the core component of inflation, monetary policy should respond.  47. The question of responding to a suppl y shock gets more complex in the context of the growth infl ation trade-off.  Unlike demand shocks, supply shocks have asymmetric implications for inflation and growth. In the case of a negative demand shock, such as wealth loss caused by say, a crash in asset prices, the impact on output and prices is generally in the same direction. The policy response in such a situation is unambiguous. In the event of a negative supply shock, such as lower farm output resulting from monsoon failure , however, while headline inflation goes up, output may come down. Thus, in the case of a negative supply shock, monetary policy confronts the dilemma of stabilisi ng output versus containing inflation.   48. Oftentimes, this is a delicate balanci ng act. If the supply shock is transitory, then the preferred policy response could be to accommodate the price pressures, recognizing the limitations of monetary policy in directly dealing with supply induced price pressures. If on the other hand, the supply shock persists, or due to strong demand conditions, the supply shoc k transmits to other components of general inflation, then monetary policy ha s to respond. Thus, in case of the former, monetary accommodation prevents further disruption to the growth momentum. In the latter case, however, ant-inflationary  monetary response may involve some sacrifice of growth.  Conclusion 49. Let me now conclude.  The thrust of my address has been to emphasize the several factors that are driv ing food inflation:  (i) shift in  dietary habits towards protein foods; (ii) pressure stemming from  inclusive growth pol icies; (iii) large increases in the minimum support prices (M SP) of food grains; (iv) shocks from global food inflation; and (v) fi nancialization of commodities.  50. Inflation is a regressive  tax and hurts the poor the most.  The impact can be particularly severe in a country like I ndia with a population of 1.2 billion, a per capita income of less than $1500 and a large share of food in the total consumption basket.  51. As discussed earlier, the direct role of monetary policy in combating food price pressures is limited, but  in the face of sustained high food inflation, monetary action may still be warranted to anchor inflation expectations.  A lasting solution to food price pressures lies in a supply res ponse that raises agricultural production and productivity, improves supply chain manage ment and sets the right incentive framework for both producers and consumers.   The outlook on food inflation in the short to medium term will be determined by the speed and quality of such a supply response by the Government.  **** ", "9 Apr 07 FM.pdf": "Special features of Financial Sector Reforms in India*Ms. Nitaya Pibulratanagit, Asst. Governor Bank of Thailand, Mr. Appiah Chairman Forex Association ofIndia, Mr. Lamba Secretary Forex Association of India, delegates from India and Asia/Middle East, ladiesand gentlemen. It is a pleasure to inaugurate the 18th annual conference of the Forex Association of Indiawhich is affiliated to ACI in this historical city of Bangkok. I understand FIMMDA had held a similarconference in Bangkok in 2003 which was inaugurated by my senior colleague Dr. Rakesh Mohan. Indiaand Thailand share a close association dating back to many centuries, which continues even in the presenttimes, both culturally as well as economically. The past few years have witnessed increasing economic andcommercial links and the signing of a number of Agreements leading to a further intensification of relations.The economies of the Asian region are emerging as the new engines of growth in the global economy and Iam sure in this year\u2019s conference many speakers will focus on the theme of the conference. For myaddress today, I intend to reflect upon the special features of financial sector reforms in India since theinitiation of the reform process in early nineties covering banking sector and financial markets and certainactions taken and contemplated. There have been innumerable evaluations of the financial sector reformsundertaken by India, some of which critical of the pace but the results achieved are acknowledged by all. Itis important to understand and appreciate the circumstances under which the entire process was guidedthrough balancing the given systemic imperatives with the need for bringing about changes in a non-disruptive manner.Financial sector reforms in India introduced as a part of the structural adjustment and economic reformsprogramme in the early 1990s have had a profound impact on the functioning of the financial institutions,especially banks.  The principal objective of financial sector reforms was to improve the allocative efficiencyof resources, ensure financial stability and maintain confidence in the financial system by enhancing itssoundness and efficiency .  At the same time, reforms were also undertaken in various segments of financialmarkets, to enable the banking sector to perform its intermediation role in an efficient manner. With a viewto making the reform measures mutually reinforcing, the reform process was carried forward throughanalysis and recommendations by various Committees/Working Groups and extensive consultations withexperts and market participants.                                           *Inaugural address by Smt. Shyamala Gopinath, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India delivered at the18th Annual National Conference of Forex Association of India on April 6, 2007 at Bangkok.I. Special features of the reforms in the financial sector\u2020\uf0b7 The reforms were not driven by any banking crisis nor were they an outcome of any externalsupport package. They were undertaken much before the importance of the financial sector to preventcrisis was recognized by international agencies and other countries in early 1990s before the Asianfinancial crisis.\uf0b7 The reforms were carefully sequenced in terms of instruments and objectives. Thus, prudentialnorms and supervisory strengthening were introduced early in the reform cycle, followed by interest ratederegulation and gradually lowering of statutory preemptions. The more complex aspects of legal andaccounting measures were ushered in subsequently when the basic tenets of the reforms were already inplace. More recently, the regulatory framework has also focused on ensuring good governance through \u201cfitand proper\u201d owners, directors and senior managers of the banks. The preference has been for diversifiedownership.\uf0b7 While the focus of the first generation of reforms was to create an efficient, productive andprofitable financial services industry, the second phase of financial sector reforms, beginning from thesecond-half of the 1990s, was aimed at strengthening of the financial system and introduction of structuralimprovements\uf0b7 The need to prepare the financial system in a more globalised environment and to promotefinancial stability in the face of domestic and external shocks was on top of agenda of reforms. Withincreasing globalisation of the Indian economy, the reform process witnessed a significant move towardsadoption of international best practices in several crucial areas of importance such as prudential norms,banking supervision, data dissemination and corporate governance.\uf0b7 With a view to increasing competition in the banking sector new private sector banks were licensed.A prerequisite for grant of the licence was that these banks had to be fully automated from day one. Theresults are self-evident as these banks have become high-tech banks. This has had a \u201cdemonstration\u201deffect on the entire system. The Government ownership in nationalized and State Bank of India wasbrought down by allowing them to raise capital from the equity market up to 49/45 per cent of paid-upcapital.\uf0b7 A unique feature of the reform of public sector banks, which dominated the Indian banking sector,was the process of financial restructuring. Banks were recapitalised by the government to meet prudentialnorms through recapitalisation bonds. The mechanism of hiving off bad loans to a separate governmentasset management company was not considered appropriate in view of the moral hazard. The overhang ofnon-performing loans had to be managed by the banks themselves.\uf0b7 The subsequent divestment of equity and offer to private shareholders was undertaken through apublic offer and not by sale to strategic investors. Consequently, all the public sector banks, which issued                                           \u2020Reddy, Y.V., \" Reforming India\u2019s Financial Sector: Changing Dimensions and Emerging Issues\", May 9, 2006 (RBI Speeches)shares to private shareholders, have been listed on the exchanges and are subject to the same disclosureand market discipline standards as other listed entities.\uf0b7 The cost of recapitalization to GDP has been low relative to experience in other countries. On acumulative basis it worked out to about one percent of the GDP. Furthermore, the market value of equityheld by Government now far exceeds the recapitalization cost. With a view to carry the reform processfurther, as announced in the Budget last year the Government decided to convert the recap bonds issuedas special securities (basically non-negotiable) to marketable securities indistinguishable from otherGovernment securities . The process has already started and in 2006-07 the Government converted nearlyRs 80 billion to SLR securities. The balance special securities will be phased out over a period.\uf0b7 Banks were also allowed to diversify into various financial services and are now offering a wholerange of financial products like universal banks.\uf0b7 Active steps were also taken to improve the institutional arrangements, including the legalframework and technological system. To tackle the issue of high level of non-performing assets (NPAs),Debt Recovery Tribunals were established consequent to the passing of Recovery of Debts Due to Banksand Financial Institutions Act, 1993.  To provide a significant impetus to banks to ensure sustainedrecovery, the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest(SARFAESI) Act was passed in 2002.\uf0b7 While transfer of NPAs of public sector banks to separate asset management companies was notconsidered, an institutional mechanism to deal with distressed assets of banks and financial institutions hasbeen created. Asset Reconstruction Companies have been allowed to be set up which are in the privatesector and operate as independent commercial entities to acquire non-performing assets from any financialentity and restructure and rehabilitate or liquidate them within a definite time frame. This has created amarket for distressed assets in India.\uf0b7 The government securities money and forex markets have significant public policy implications foran emerging market economy. These have developed during the reform period with impressivediversification of participants and instruments.\uf0b7 The smooth functioning of the payment and settlement system is a pre-requisite for financialstability. The introduction of RTGS and setting up of the CCIL which acts as a central counterparty forsecurities and forex transactions and guarantees both the securities and funds legs of the transaction  haveenhanced the efficiency of the payments mechanism.\uf0b7 In terms of the processes also, certain interesting features of the reforms are in evidence. The firsthas been its gradualism, wherein reforms were undertaken only after a process of close and continuousconsultation with all stakeholders. This participative process with wider involvement not only encouraged amore informed evaluation of underlying content of policies but also enhanced the credibility of policies andgenerated expectations among economic agents about the process being enduring in nature.There has been a constant rebalancing of reform priorities predicated upon the domestic and globalbusiness environment, institution of prudential practices, upgradation of the regulatory and supervisoryframework, institution of appropriate institutional and legal reforms and the state of openness of theeconomy.Impact of reforms in the banking sector(i) Performance indicatorsVarious measures initiated over the last decade-and-a half have significantly strengthened the commercialbanking sector in terms of profitability, asset quality and capital position. The soundness parameters of thebanking system, in particular, have shown sustained improvement.The asset quality of the Indian banking system has improved significantly over the past one decade. TheNPAs of all SCBs, which stood at 15.7 per cent of gross advances and 7.0 per cent of total assets in 1995-96, declined to 3.3 per cent of gross advances and 1.9 per cent of total assets in 2005-06 (Table 1). Similartrend can also be seen in the net NPAs ratios during the same period, reflecting better recoveries by banksand better allocation of funds. There has been a distinct improvement in the recovery climate in recentyears facilitated by strong macroeconomic performance and institutional measures initiated by the ReserveBank/Government. It is also significant to note that the asset quality of public sector  banks has been betterthan private sector banks \u2013 both  old and new \u2013 in terms of net NPL ( i.e., net of  provisioning).Table 1: Gross and Net NPAs of Scheduled Commercial BanksYear Non-performing assets(end-March) Gross NetAs percentageof grossadvancesAs percentageof totalassetsAs percentageof netadvancesAs percentageof totalassets1 2 3 4 51996-97 15.7 7.0 8.1 3.31999-00 12.7 5.5 6.8 2.72002-03 8.8 4.0 4.4 1.92005-06 3.3 1.9 1.2 0.7Source:  Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy 2005-06.The financial performance of SCBs had also improved during the recent past as reflected in theirprofitability. The operating profit to assets ratio of SCBs, which was 1.69 in 1995-96, increased to 2.03 in2005-06 (Table 2). Net profit to assets of SCBs remained in the range of 0.47 to 1.13 during the period1995-96 to 2005-06. The impact of greater competition and improved efficiency of the Indian bankingsystem could also be seen from the significant reduction in interest spread over the reform period.Table 2: Important financial Indicators \u2013SCBsYear OperatingProfittoAssetsNet Profitto AssetsIncometo AssetsExpenditureto AssetsOperat-ingExpensesto AssetsProvisionsandContingenciesto AssetsSpread(NII)toAssets1 2 3 4 5 6 7 81995-96 1.69 0.68 - - 2.94 1.54 3.131999-00 1.66 0.66 10.40 9.74 2.50 1.00 2.732002-03 2.39 1.01 10.14 9.14 2.24 1.39 2.772005-06 2.03 0.88 7.97 7.09 2.11 1.15 2.78Source : Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India, various issues.One of the major objectives of banking sector reforms was to enhance efficiency and productivity throughincreased competition. That the competition has intensified could be gauged from the decline in the shareof public sector banks in the total income, expenditure and assets of the commercial banking system sincethe mid-1990s, and increase in the share of new private sector banks (Table 3).Table 3: Bank Group-wise Shares: Select Indicators(Per cent)1995-96 1999-2000 2002-03 2005-061 2 3 4 5Public Sector BanksIncome 82.5 78.8 74.5 72.4Expenditure 84.2 79.4 74.8 73.1Total Assets 84.4 80.2 75.7 72.3Net Profit -39.1 70.0 64.8 67.3Gross Profit 74.3 70.9 76.6 69.2Private Sector BanksIncome 8.2 12.3 18.5 19.7Expenditure 7.4 12.0 18.6 19.7Total Assets 7.7 12.3 17.5 20.5Net Profit     59.3     16.8    15.6    20.3Gross Profit    10.1     14.5    18.7    19.0Foreign BanksIncome     9.4      9.0     7.0    7.8Expenditure     8.3      8.7     6.6     7.3Total Assets     7.9      7.5     6.9     7.2Net Profit    79.8     13.2     19.6     12.5Gross Profit    15.6     14.6      4.7     11.8Source:  Reserve Bank of India.Comparison with Other CountriesSeveral balance sheet and profitability indicators suggest that the Indian banking sector indicators aremoving towards global benchmarks (Table 4).Table 4: Select Banking Indicators: Cross-Country(End-March)Return on Assets Regulatory capital torisk-weighted AssetsNon-PerformingLoans to total LoansCountry2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 20061 2 3 4 5 6 7Emerging MarketsArgentina 0.9 1.9 \u2026 \u2026 5.2 4.7Brazil 2.1 2.3 17.4 \u2026 4.4 \u2026Mexico 2.4 2.4 14.3 16.0 1.8 1.7Korea 1.2 1.3 12.8 13.1 1.2 1.2South Africa 1.1 \u2026 12.3 12.6 1.5 1.3Developed CountriesUS 1.3 1.4 13.0 13.1 0.7 0.7UK 0.8 \u2026 12.8 \u2026 1.0 \u2026Japan 0.5 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 1.8 \u2026Canada 0.7 \u2026 12.9 13.0 0.5 \u2026Australia 1.8 \u2026 10.3 \u2026 0.2 \u2026Memo :India * 0.9 0.9 12.8 12.4 5.2 3.3\u2026 Not available.Note: Data relating to Brazil, UK and Australia relate to the end-December, 2005 and 2006.Source: Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR), September 2006.(ii) Resolution of NPAs : The Narasimham Committee I had suggested the creation of an Asset CreationFund to which the public sector banks would transfer the non-performing assets with certain safeguards.After deliberations it was decided not to adopt this approach. Instead banks were required to deal with allthe non-performing assets themselves and it is clear from the performance indicators above that thisstrategy has been effective. Fiscal support has not been burdensome and legacy problems such as non-performing loans have been absorbed by banks and not transferred to fisc. Although subsequently theGovernment passed a legislation to create a new category of companies called Asset reconstructioncompanies, it must be noted that these entities are private commercial entities and work on a commercialbasis to deal with distressed assets. These institutions as well as guidelines that permit banks to purchaseand sell NPAs and the Corporate Debt Restructuring mechanism have enabled banks to deal with the \u201cflow\u201dand not merely the stock of NPAs. These measures enable the banks to deal with the NPAs on an ongoingbasis.(iii) Ownership structure:  Since public sector banks could divest only by accessing the stock marketsexcept for a few banks all the others are now listed on the stock exchanges. The Government holding inthese banks range from 51 percent (OBC, Dena) to 76 percent (BOM). Of the privately held equity,significant portion (15 to 20 percent) was held by foreign investors in quite a few public sector banks as on30 September 2006. All new private banks are listed and there is considerable foreign investment (both FDIand FII) in these banks. In five of the existing eight banks foreign shareholding had crossed 50 percent. \u2021Even among the old private banks all significant banks are listed.(iii) Consolidation:  The process of consolidation has also been taking place in India. Since 1990, 19mergers have taken place in the commercial banking sector.  Bank mergers have taken place in Indiamostly with the objective to synergise the strength of the merging institutions. Broad guidelines have beenlaid down by RBI for mergers for private sector banks from a regulatory and prudential perspective andthese guidelines apply to public sector banks mutatis mutandis and to the extent relevant.(iv) Extension of coverage of reform processThe reform process initially focused on commercial banks. However, after significant progress was made totransform commercial banks into sound institutions, the reform process was extended to encompass otherinstitutions such as regional rural banks (RRBs), cooperative banks, All-India financial institutions (AIFIs)and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). The regional rural banks, urban co-operative banks andrural co-operative credit institutions can play a major role in financial inclusion and deepening of thefinancial sector, particularly in the rural areas.  The co-operative credit institutions, both urban and rural, arenow placed on the path of revival through a consultative method of policy formulation, ensuring a workableregulatory arrangement to overcome the incentive problems and financial support wherever necessary. Thestrategy has started showing results which is crucial for sustaining their role in financial intermediationamong the rural and urban poor and small savers.Recent initiatives(i) Supervision of financial conglomeratesFinancial conglomerates (FC) pose certain risks to the financial system which could be detrimental to theoverall financial stability.  These risks relate to the moral hazard associated with the \u2018Too-Big-To-Fail\u2019position of many financial conglomerates, the fact that financial difficulties in one subsidiary in a segmentcould have contagion or reputation effects on another subsidiary in a different segment on account of the'holding out' phenomenon, especially when using the same brand name, and the concerns about regulatoryarbitrage, non-arm\u2019s length dealings, etc. arising out of Intra-group Transactions & Exposures (ITEs) - bothfinancial and non-financial.  The financial sector in India has undergone significant liberalisation in all thefour segments - banking, non-banking finance, securities and insurance and each of these sectors hasgrown significantly accompanied by a process of restructuring among the market intermediaries. Thefinancial landscape is increasingly witnessing (i) entry of some of the bigger banks into other financial                                           \u2021The composite ceiling on foreign investment in private banks is 74 percent (FII ceiling within this is 49 percent).In public sector banks non-resident shareholding cannot exceed 20 percent.segments like merchant banking, insurance, etc. which has made them financial 'conglomerates'; (ii)emergence of several new players with diversified presence across major segments and (iii) possibility ofsome of the non-banking institutions in the financial sector acquiring large enough proportions to have asystemic impact.  In view of the above, a Working Group had gone into all the issues and had laid downcriteria for a group being identified as a financial conglomerate. Accordingly a system has been put in placefor all the identified financial conglomerates whereby a designated entity within the conglomerate reports toits Lead Regulator.  In order to monitor the intra group transactions and exposures, information from thedesignated entities of each FC is obtained by the principal regulators and a system for exchange ofinformation among the regulators has been put in place.  In addition, periodical discussions are held withthe CEO of the designated entity in the FC by the Lead Regulator, along with other regulators, on the basisof available information for review and addressing concerns, if any.It is also necessary to back-test the efficacy of the reporting format in capturing the meaningful intra-grouptransactions/exposures and other `material\u2019 information and also enhance the regulatory understanding ofthe affairs of the conglomerates. Further work is being undertaken in this direction in consultation with otherregulators.The inter-regulatory forum has also observed a need for the principal regulator to engage in dialogue withthe principal auditors of the group. This could provide useful information on the impact of changes in theaccounting standards and practices on the core earnings of the conglomerates and the likely trend in thefuture. The modalities for this purpose are being worked out in consultation with other regulators.(ii) New capital instrumentsIn Jan 2006, RBI allowed Indian banks to augment their capital funds by issue of innovative perpetual debtinstruments eligible for inclusion as Tier I capital; debt capital instruments eligible for inclusion as UpperTier II capital; perpetual non-cumulative preference shares eligible for inclusion as Tier I capital andredeemable cumulative preference shares eligible for inclusion as Tier II capital. A number of banks haveissued these instruments both in India and overseas to shore up capital(iii) Procyclical prudential provisioningTraditionally, banks\u2019 loans and advances portfolio is pro-cyclical and tends to grow faster during anexpansionary phase and grows slowly during a recessionary phase. During times of expansion andaccelerated credit growth, there is a tendency to underestimate the level of inherent risk and the converseholds good during times of recession. This tendency is not effectively addressed by the above mentionedprudential specific provisioning requirements since they capture risk ex post  but not ex ante . The variousoptions available for reducing the element of pro-cyclicality include, among others, adoption of objectivemethodologies for dynamic provisioning requirements, as is being done by a few countries, by estimatingthe requirements over a business cycle rather than a year on the basis of the riskiness of the assets,establishment of a linkage between the prudential capital requirements and through-the-cycle ratingsinstead of point-in-time ratings and establishment of a flexible loan-to-value (LTV) ratio requirements wherethe LTV ratio would be directly related to the movement of asset values.The above aspect was first taken on board in the Monetary Policy announcement in October 2005 andsince then, various measures have been announced.In order to ensure that asset quality is maintained in the light of high credit growth, the general provisioningrequirement on standard advances in certain specific sensitive sectors have been increased as also the riskweights. For instance the risk weight on personal loans (including credit card receivables) is 125% and thegeneral provision is 2 percent. Similarly the general provisions for real estate loans is 2 percent and the riskweight 150 percent. The objective is to build cushions or buffers in upswings without taking a view on thefuture evolution of asset quality in these asset classes.(iv) Credit Information Companies:  An efficient credit information system enhances the quality of creditdecisions and improves the asset quality of banks, apart from facilitating faster credit delivery. Accordingly,a scheme for disclosure of information regarding defaulting borrowers of banks and financial institutionswas introduced.  In order to facilitate sharing of information related to credit matters, a Credit InformationBureau (India) Limited (CIBIL) was set up in 2000. With a view to strengthening the legal mechanism andfacilitating credit information bureaus to collect, process and share credit information on borrowers of banksand FIs, the Credit Information Act was passed in May 2005. The rules and regulations have also beennotified.  The RBI is now framing detailed guidelines on the basis of which it would consider applicationsfrom Credit Information companies. This will facilitate setting up of a few more credit information companiesin India.(v) Financial inclusion : Recognising the concerns with regard to the banking practices that tend toexclude rather than attract vast sections of population, the Reserve Bank has urged banks to review theirexisting practices with a view to aligning them with the objective of financial inclusion. All banks wereadvised in November 2005 to make available a basic banking \u2018no-frills\u2019 account either with \u2018nil\u2019 or very lowminimum balances as well as charges that would make such accounts accessible to vast sections ofpopulation. With a view to encourage financial inclusion the KYC procedure for opening small accountswere simplified. Banks are allowed to use the services of NGOs/ SHGs, MFIs and CSOs as intermediariesin providing financial and banking services through the use of business facilitator and correspondents.Future Work Program(i)Draft guidelines on accounting aspectsRecognising the importance of a robust accounting framework in the banking sector, the Reserve Bank hadundertaken an exercise a few years back (in 2001) to assess the gaps in compliance by banks with theaccounting standards issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. With the issue of relevantguidelines thereafter, the audited financial statements of banks are found to be in compliance with therelevant accounting standards. With a view to take things further in this direction, the Reserve Bank hastaken the initiative to introduce the various elements of IAS 39 into the guidelines for accounting of theinvestment portfolio and the derivative portfolios of banks. We do not have a corresponding accountingstandard to IAS 39 in India as yet. The ICAI is presently engaged in the process of issue of this standardand that process is likely to take some more time, hence the initiative from the Reserve Bank of India. TheReserve Bank has issued draft guidelines on the above two aspects, which are in the process of finalisationon the basis of the feedback received from banks and other market players.(ii)Derivatives \u2013 Comprehensive guidelinesDerivatives play a critical role in shaping the overall risk profile of banks. Over the years, banks have beenincreasingly using derivatives for managing risks and have also been offering these products to corporates.The Reserve Bank has issued several guidelines to banks from time to time on various derivativeinstruments. In view of the growing complexity, diversity and volume of derivatives used by banks, anInternal Group has been constituted by the Reserve Bank to review the existing guidelines on derivativesand formulate comprehensive guidelines on derivatives for banks. These guidelines are intended to coverbroad generic principles for undertaking derivative transactions, management of risk and sound corporategovernance requirements. The draft guidelines were placed on the Reserve Bank's website in December,2006. The feedback received on the guidelines is being examined by the Internal Group and the draftguidelines are in the process of finalisation.(iii) Draft Guidelines on Stress TestingRisk management practices in banks in India have undergone considerable improvement over the past fewyears with the introduction of the financial sector liberalization process in the mid nineties. The processgained momentum with the issue of regulatory guidelines and guidance notes on asset liabilitymanagement and management of credit risk, market risk and operational risk by the Reserve Bank since1999. Further, the announcement of implementation of the revised capital adequacy framework in India witheffect from March 31, 2007 has brought the risk management capabilities of banks into greater focus.Globally, banks are increasingly relying on statistical models to measure and manage the financial risks towhich they are exposed. These models are gaining credibility because they provide a framework foridentifying, analyzing, measuring, communicating and managing these risks. Since models cannotincorporate all possible risk outcomes and generally are not capable of capturing \u2018event risks\u2019 and sudden /dramatic changes, banks need to supplement models with \u2018stress tests\u2019. Internationally, stress testing hasbecome an integral part of banks\u2019 risk management systems and is used to evaluate the potentialvulnerability to certain unlikely but plausible events or movements in financial variables. There are broadlytwo categories of stress tests used in banks viz. sensitivity tests and scenario tests. These may be usedeither separately or in conjunction with each other.Banks in India are beginning to use statistical models to measure and manage risks. Further, thesupervisory review process under Pillar 2 of Basel II framework is intended not only to ensure that bankshave adequate capital to support all the risks in their business, but also to encourage banks to develop anduse better risk management techniques in monitoring and managing their risks. Banks must demonstrate,under the internal capital adequacy assessment process prescribed by Pillar 2, that they have enoughcapital to not only meet the minimum capital requirements but also to withstand a range of severe butplausible shocks. In the above background, the need for banks in India to adopt \u2018stress tests\u2019 as a riskmanagement tool is being emphasised by RBI.(v) Basel II The Reserve Bank and the commercial banks have been preparing to implement Basel II.  TheReserve Bank had earlier intended in June 2005 that by March 31, 2007 all commercial banks wouldcomply with Basel II. However, taking into account the state of preparedness of the banking system, it wasdecided in October 2006 to provide banks some more time to put in place appropriate systems so as toensure full compliance with Basel II. According to the new  schedule, foreign banks operating in India andIndian banks having presence outside India are to migrate to the standardised approach for credit risk andthe basic indicator approach for operational risk under Basel II with effect from March 31, 2008. All otherscheduled commercial banks are encouraged to migrate to these approaches under Basel II in alignmentwith them but in any case not later than March 31, 2009.The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) had undertaken the Fifth Quantitative Impact Study(QIS-5) to assess the impact of adoption of the revised Framework. Eleven Indian banks, accounting forabout 50 per cent of market share (by assets), participated in the QIS-5 exercise. An empirical analysisindicates that the combined capital adequacy ratio of these banks is expected to come down by about 100basis points when these banks apply Basel II norms for standardised approach for credit risk and basicindicator approach for operational risk. Although none of the banks which participated in the exercise wouldbe breaching the minimum capital adequacy ratio under the new framework, the net impact reflects a widerange. The draft guidelines on Basel II implementation has been placed in public domain but meanwhileRBI has asked the banks to undertake parallel calculation of the CAR based on the Standardised Approachon a quarterly basis from December 2006 and report it to RBI. These would enable RBI to assess theimpact of the revised guidelines and enable banks to also assess /calibrate the capital requirements.(vi) Mortgage Guarantee CompaniesAs announced in the Budget RBI has now placed in public domain draft guidelines on mortgage guaranteecompanies. These will be a new category under the NBFC sector and the activities will be in the nature ofmortgage guarantees and not mortgage insurance. Mortgage insurance falls within the jurisdiction of theInsurance regulator.(vii) FSAP\u2013 Self assessment:  A Committee on Financial Sector Assessment to undertake a self-assessment of financial sector stability and development has been constituted. For the purpose of carryingout the task under the terms of reference, the Committee has decided to set up four Advisory Panels whichwould be assisting the Committee in its assessment exercise and would be drawn from non-Official expertsin relevant areas related to financial stability assessment and stress testing, transparency standards,financial regulation and supervision, and institutions and market structure respectively.  To providenecessary inputs to the Advisory Panels, it has been decided to set up Technical Groups comprising mainlyof Officials directly working in respective areas of regulatory institutions.Finally a few comments on reforms in Financial MarketsWell developed financial markets enable the central bank to effectively conduct monetary policy and help inimproving the allocative efficiency of resources. Interest rates on benchmark Government securitiesfacilitate appropriate pricing of other financial assets. It has, therefore, been the endeavour of the ReserveBank to promote development of all the segments of financial market under its regulatory provision. This issought to be achieved by easing restrictions on transactions, reducing transaction costs, increasing thewidth and depth of the market and introducing trading and settlement systems in line with international bestpractices.In the money market, there has been a significant transformation after the introduction of financial sectorreforms in terms of instruments, participants and technological infrastructure and transparency. Variousreform measures have resulted in a relatively deep liquid and vibrant money market. Further developmentof the market depends among others on better ALM practices by banks.In the Government securities market, several measures have been initiated since 1990s includingguaranteed settlement in respect of all government securities trade through the RBI and I do not want to gointo each of them. However from the fiscal year 2006-07, as per the provisions under the FiscalResponsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act 2003, the Reserve Bank's participation in the primarymarket for Central Government securities stands withdrawn. This has necessitated significant changes inthe setting and operating framework of monetary, debt management and regulatory policies of the ReserveBank.One of the initiatives taken in this regard is broad basing of Primary Dealership system: Till last year,primary dealer activity was confined to Primary Dealer institutions. In order to broad base the activity, thestructure of Primary Dealership business was expanded to include all Scheduled Commercial Banks(excluding RRBs), which fulfill certain minimum eligibility criteria. An option was given to the existingPrimary Dealer entities to fold back the PD business into their parent bank or group companies.Consequently, the configuration of the PD system changed from 17 standalone entities at the beginning ofthe year to 8 standalone entities and 10 banks undertaking PD business departmentally by the end of year2006-07.Reserve Bank has been undertaking passive consolidation of securities by reissuing the existing securitiesto build up stock at key maturities.  During 2006-07, the reissues accounted for 91% of the total issuancesmade.  Since passive consolidation takes longer time to make an impact on enhancing the liquidity, Activeconsolidation was proposed by way of buying back illiquid bonds and reissuing liquid bonds.  The Schemehas been finalized in consultation with the Government and the budgetary provision of Rs. 25 billion hasalso been made in this regard.  Further action is being taken by RBI.To create and enhance market liquidity even during the phases of falling prices, select participants havebeen permitted to short sell securities in G-sec markets.   The short sales were initially permitted (February28, 2006) on an intra-day basis where the participant can short during the day but was required to cover itby the end of the day.  After assessing the market feedback and after consultations with the participants,the short sales have been extended to five day period there by permitting participants to carry forward theirshort positions beyond the settlement cycles.  To enable delivery against the short positions, the sale ofrepoed stock has also been permitted. With the participants gradually putting in place internal systems toundertake short sales with the approval of the respective Board, it is expected that the liquidity in marketswould increase.The primary issuance framework required revamping in the light of RBI\u2019s withdrawal from the primaryissuances of Central Government effective April 01, 2006.  Along with the restructuring of the underwritingcommitments of PDs to ensure 100% underwriting and permitting PDs to diversify their businesses, \u2018WI\u2019trading has been introduced to enable better distribution of auctioned stock and also more efficient pricediscovery.  \u2018WI\u2019 trading was initially permitted in reissued securities (May 2006) and the same hassubsequently been extended to newly issued securities (Nov 2006) which would be operationalised afterthe necessary software modifications which is at an advanced stage.The enactment of the Government Securities Act 2006 has enabled introduction of \u201cSTRIPS\u201d in India. TheRBI is taking steps for developing a market in STRIPS. The implementation of STRIPS would facilitatecreation of a series of benchmark rates and enable evolution of a market structure for selling the securitiesin retail. Apart from expanding the investor base, introduction of STRIPS would also enable developing aproper yield curve. Based on the recommendations of the Working Group on STRIPS submitted in July2004, an implementation team is working on the fine print for the introduction of STRIPS and is also lookingat the international experience in this regard which has been varied. The RBI has consulted marketparticipants on the operational issues such as the model, securities eligible for stripping, whether exclusivityshould be granted to PDs etc. In regard to securities to be made eligible for stripping two pairs of coupondates i.e., 02 January/02 July & 16 April/16 October have been identified with all securities having theircoupon dates as any of the above being eligible for stripping. In future, to improve liquidity of STRIPS,securities both re-issues as well as fresh issues may have to be aligned with these dates. Simultaneously,the RBI is dealing with the issue of system changes.The securitised debt market in India is also growing and increasingly banks will need to considersecuritisation of their debt to meet growing credit requirements and manage capital efficiently. The RBIregulatory framework provides a sound basis for the growth of this market.The approach to liberalisation of forex market in India has remained cautious with a clear emphasis on theneed to safeguards against potential financial instability that could arise due to excessive speculation in theforeign exchange market. The reforms were carefully sequenced in respect to instruments and objectives.Although the access to forex markets by non-banks is predicated on the underlying commercialtransactions, over a period considerable flexibility is available to cover these transactions on a dynamicbasis for both trade and non-trade transactions.  The impact of the reform initiatives is clearly discernible interms of depth and efficiency of the market in all segments. Average daily gross turnover in the forexmarket has steadily increased to USD 28.6 billion as of January 31, 2007.The RBI has proposed a further expansion of the access to the options market for corporates by allowingcovered options. This will be part of the overall final derivatives policy. Similarly, we are examining therequest of certain commodity companies to hedge their economic exposures in overseas exchanges whichwas also recommended by the Technical Group on Forex Markets.Finally since this is a body of forex professionals I would like to stress the need to provide efficient andcompetitive service to individuals and small enterprises. With increasing globalisation the foreign exchangerequirements of these categories of persons are also growing. With this objective, RBI has allowed entitieswhich meet certain criteria to act as a limited authorised dealer (Category II) for certain non-trade currentaccount transactions. Existing FFMCs, UCBs, and RRBs are also eligible for such licences. Individuals andsmall enterprises do not have adequate access to competitive and efficient service on foreign exchange.The exporters particularly smaller exporters and there are a large number of them do need better advice onhedging their currency exposures. Banks should consider devising products for the SME sector which willreduce transaction costs on foreign exchange transactions.I wish the Conference all success in its deliberations.", "28 May 07 MP.pdf": "India \u2013 Perspective for Growth with Stability1Professor Sakakibara, Governor Fukui, Ambassador Singh and the distinguishedparticipants,I am honoured to be invited at the 'Symposium on Current India' organised by theWaseda University Institute for Indian Economic Studies. I am grateful to ProfessorSakakibara, a globally distinguished economic statesman, for inviting me to be here.It is also a privilege to share a platform with universally respected Governor Fukui.There are strong complementarities in the economic endowments of India andJapan. For example, these relate to capital surplus, demography, technologicalspecialistion and raw material endowment. We know that Indo-Japan trade andeconomic relations are moving on to a new trajectory with major new initiatives inAsia.Several infrastructure projects in India are being considered in joint-partnership withJapan. I hope that during the Symposium, vital issues and areas relevant for themutual benefit of both countries would be highlighted.Keeping in view the topic of the Symposium and my locus standi , I have chosen tospeak on 'Perspective for Growth with Stability' in the context of Indian economy.1. A Quarter Century of Growth with Stability (1980-2005)The Indian economy has been growing at an average growth rate of about 6.0 percent over a period of 25 years since 1980-81 (India\u2019s fiscal year is from 1st April to31st March).The important point to note is that not only the growth rate of the Indian economyhas been high during this period, but there has been considerable amount of stabilityalso. A remarkable feature of India's growth experience has been its resilience toboth global and domestic shocks.Several hypotheses are given to explain this level of consistency in India's growthrate despite the fact that we faced several exogenous shocks like contagion effect ofinternational financial crises, security tensions, international sanctions, poor rainfall,etc.                                               1 Address by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Symposium on Current India atthe Institute for Indian Economic Studies, Waseda University, Nikkei, Shinbun on May 28, 2007.The dominance of domestic consumption, contributing on an average to almost two-thirds of the overall demand, has helped in reducing the volatility of GDP. Servicessector is dominant and less volatile compared to agriculture and this phenomenonhas also been imparting stability to the Indian growth process. The larger share ofthe services sector growth is currently providing the synergy between services andmanufacturing industry, which is enhancing total factor productivity andcompetitiveness in both. However, agriculture remains the most critical sector forensuring sustained growth, over the medium term, to benefit large masses of people\u2013 especially in rural areas.2. Recent Acceleration of Growth and ConfidenceAfter growing at around 6 per cent for 25 years, India has entered into what onemight call a high-growth phase, with the growth rate averaging 8.6 per cent perannum in the last four years since 2003-04. During this period, the average inflationrate has been contained at about 5 per cent, which has been significantly lower thanthat of around 8 per cent in the previous three-and-a-half decades. In the last twoyears, the growth rate has averaged 9.1 per cent with GDP estimated to have grownat 9.2 per cent in 2006-07. For the year 2007-08, the Reserve Bank projects thegrowth rate in GDP is to be around 8.5 per cent.During 2006-07, the average headline inflation rate remained at about 5.4 per centdespite some pick up in inflation rate to above 6 per cent in the terminal months offinancial year 2006-07. There is some moderation since then and the headlineinflation for the week ended May 12, 2007, is 5.27 per cent. For the year 2007-08,the Reserve Bank's policy endeavour would be to contain inflation close to 5.0 percent in 2007-08. In recognition of India\u2019s evolving integration with the globaleconomy and societal preferences, the resolve, going forward, is to condition policyand expectations for inflation in the range of 4.0\u20134.5 per cent. This objective wouldbe conducive for maintaining self-accelerating growth over the medium-term.A welcome development in regard to inflation and growth prospects is that the fiscalposition of the Government, both central and States, is undergoing consolidation interms of targeted reduction in fiscal deficit indicators. The improvement in the fiscalposition of several States is particularly impressive.A notable recent development is that India is also becoming a major hub formanufacturing and export of manufactured products and some examples of globalcompetitiveness of Indian industry may be in order.  Steel production in India is nowamongst the lowest-cost production in the world. Pharmaceutical and biotech firmsare likewise very competitive internationally. In recent years, we have witnessed thecoming of age of the Indian IT multinationals, indigenous players beginning to buildnoticeable presence in other locations \u2013 through cross-border acquisitions, off-shorewinning of contracts and organic growth in other low-cost locations. Indianmanufacturing firms are acquiring firms abroad to leverage comparative advantageof foreign locations, using synergies between the parent company and the companyunder acquisition to gain scale economies as well as domain knowledge.It is a matter of satisfaction to the Reserve Bank of India that the financial sector hasacquired greater strength, efficiency and stability. This is the combined effect ofincreased competition, regulatory measures aligned with international standards,conducive policy environment and motivation amongst the market players, includingthe banks. The money market has been progressively developed. The Governmentsecurities market is deep, liquid, vibrant and well developed in terms of instruments,processes and participants. The exchange rate of the rupee has been flexible,particularly, in the last few years and the turnover in the foreign exchange markethas increased considerably. The stock market has been opened to foreigninstitutional investors and is comparable with major international equity markets interms of market capitalisation, turnover and systems and processes.True, the corporate debt market in India is somewhat less developed relative tomajor financial centres, but has a large potential in the medium term to raiseresources particularly for infrastructure projects, housing and for corporate andmunicipal needs. Supply of institutional funds is likely to be enhanced with ongoingtransformation in insurance and pension sectors. The well-developed governmentsecurities market, the strong micro-structures and financial infrastructure, the skillsof market participants should enable a very rapid and healthy growth of the debtmarkets in India.As far as India\u2019s external sector is concerned, it has become resilient with thecurrent account deficit being maintained at very modest levels after a couple ofyears\u2019 marginal surplus. Exports have been growing at an average rate of around 24per cent during the last four years. Sustained growth in export of services andremittances continued to provide buoyancy to the surplus in the invisible account.There was a significant strengthening in the capital account. With the foreignexchange reserves above US$ 200 billion, the reserves currently exceed thecountry\u2019s external debt of about US$ 142.7 billion as at end December 2006, therebyreflecting improved external sector sustainability of the economy.The current mood in our country on Indian economy is best summed up in the wordsof our Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh:\u201cWe must think big and bold. We must move away from the paradigm of incrementalgrowth to a paradigm of exponential growth and growth into uncharted territory. \u201d3. Explorations on Economic ProspectsThere are sound reasons for the optimism expressed in our Prime Minister\u2019sstatement and the overarching policy challenge at this stage is to manage thetransition to a higher-growth path in a sustainable manner by  containing inflationarypressures. In this context, I would like to explore here some relevant issues.(i) Savings-investment : Favourable trendsThe strengthening of economic activity in the recent years has been supported bypersistent increase in domestic investment rate from 22.9 per cent of GDP in 2001-02 to 33.8 per cent in 2005-06 coupled with an efficient use of capital. Domesticsaving rate has also improved from 23.5 per cent to 32.4 per cent during the sameperiod. This was made possible due to improvements in both public sector andprivate corporate savings. Given the fact that Indian per capita income is increasingrapidly and policy efforts towards financial deepening for achieving a more inclusivegrowth are underway, savings rate in India could even rise further in the medium tolong run. The level of saving rates should help finance the investment needs of theeconomy especially for development of social and physical infrastructure. As alreadymentioned in regard to financial sector developments, especially the corporate debtmarket, we should expect efficient financial intermediation to match the growth insavings, especially long-term contractual savings, through insurance companies andpension funds and meet the growing demands for long-term funds for infrastructurein India.(ii) Evidence of increasing productivityYet another positive factor for India is the trend in productivity. Some of the recentstudies relating to India have indicated an increase in total factor productivity (TFP)growth in recent years.  For instance, Rodrick and Subramanian, in an IMF workingpaper of 2004, point out that India seems to have large amount of productivitygrowth from a relatively modest reforms. A more recent paper by Barry Bosworth,Susan Collins, and Arvind Virmani (2006) confirms this trend.  They find that outputper worker grew only 1.3 per cent annually during 1960-1980, when GDP growthwas also at a low of 3.4 per cent. TFP growth was barely above zero, according totheir calculations, indicating that growth in output was almost entirely driven bygrowth in inputs.  In contrast, growth in output per worker nearly tripled to 3.8 percent during 1980-2004, while TFP increased ten-fold to 2 per cent.The evidence of an increase in the growth of labour productivity is also availablefrom other studies (Economic Intelligence Unit, 2007). A Study by Tata Services(2003) found that for the all-India manufacturing sector, labour productivity (outputper unit of labour) has increased significantly during the post-reform period,compared to the pre-reform period.(iii) Physical infrastructure : Grounds for optimismAdmittedly, a critical constraint to economic growth in India in recent years has beenthe infrastructure deficit.  The Approach Paper to the 11th Five Year Plan hasestimated that for accelerating the GDP growth from 7 to 9 per cent, there is a needfor accelerating the current level of investment in infrastructure from 4.6 per cent ofGDP to 8 per cent during the Plan period. The issue of providing adequate andquality infrastructure has already attracted attention of policy makers at all levels.The Committee on Infrastructure, headed by the honourable Prime Minister, hasestimated the investment requirements of the Indian economy during the 11th Five-Year Plan at around US$ 345 billion, i.e., roughly 8 per cent of GDP, every year.There are several grounds for optimism in regard to overcoming the problemsrelating to physical infrastructure, provided the framework of public policy, especiallyregulatory environment, is conducive. First, there is adequate generation of domesticsavings while India has also become an attractive destination for foreign capital.. Asin the past, over 90 to 95 per cent of investment could be funded by domesticsavings. As already mentioned, recent developments in insurance, pension, debtmarket, fiscal side, etc., add to the prospects of efficient and adequate domesticfinancing options for infrastructure development. Second, the infrastructureinvestments in India are basically demand driven and hence, are likely to have ashort gestation. Third, there are significant domestic entrepreneurial-, construction-,technological-skill capabilities to execute the projects efficiently and promptly.Fourth, the growth and quality of services sector in India adds to the potential forenhanced productivity in investments in physical infrastructure. Finally, a dynamicmix of public-private and domestic-foreign partnership is already evident in manysectors such as airports.(iv) Improvements in fiscal balanceIt is true that the aggregate stock of public debt of the Centre and States as apercentage of GDP is high, currently at around seventy five per cent. However, thereare signs of improvement even after adjusting for recent favourable cyclical factors.The fiscal-management of Central Government is broadly in the direction ofachieving the targeted ratio of gross fiscal deficit (GFD) to gross domestic product(GDP) to three per cent and eliminate revenue deficit (RD)  by 2008-09. It may benoted that the GFD / GDP and RD / GDP ratios are already budgeted to reduce to3.3 per cent and 1.5 per cent in 2007-08. In the recent years, there has been asignificant improvement in State level finances also. The GFD of all States declinedfrom 4.7 per cent of GDP in 1999-2000 to 2.7 per cent of GDP in 2006-07, while theRD came down from 2.7 per cent of GDP to 0.1 per cent of GDP. Most States havealso enacted fiscal responsibility legislations.It is also useful to note that there are several unique features of management ofpublic debt in India, which imparts overall stability to macro-economy. First, Stateshave no direct exposure to external debt. Second, almost the whole of public debt islocal currency denominated and held almost wholly by residents. Third,  public debt,of both Centre and States is actively and prudently managed by the Reserve Bank ofIndia ensuring comfort to financial markets without any undue volatility.. Fourth,  thegovernment securities market has developed significantly in recent years in terms ofturnover, depth and participants, and significant further improvements are underway.Fifth, stable contractual savings supplement marketable debt in financing deficits.Finally, direct monetary financing of primary issues of debt has been discontinuedsince April 2006. Hence, the high stock of public debt relative to GDP has not so farbeen a matter of concern as far as stability is concerned, while it is recognised thatlong term sustainability would call for a gradual reduction to prudential levels.(v) Demographic dividend and challengeIndia has the world\u2019s youngest and fastest growing working-age population. Atpresent, about 36 per cent of Indian population is below 15 years age.  It is expectedthat the average age of the population in India will decline, before it begins to riseafter 25 years. In contrast to the rise in the median age of population in theindustrialised countries from early 30s to early 40s over the last two decades, themedian age in India has increased from 20 in 1980 to 24 in 2005. According to theprojections made by the United Nations, the median age in India would cross 30,only by 2025 and would remain around 35 till 2040. In 2020, the average Indian willbe only 29 years old, compared with the average age of 37 years in China and theUS, 45 in west Europe and 48 in Japan.While there are some inter-regional differences in demographic features, given thefree labour mobility, for the country as a whole, the relatively prolonged favourabledemographic transition would have an important bearing on the overall economicgrowth process.Given our emphasis on human resource development in terms of producing largenumber of engineers, technologists, doctors, etc., it is expected that a large andyoung population of India would have high labour productivity along with lower needfor social security and health related expenditures. This is expected to power thegrowth process of not only India, but would increasingly meet the growing need ofother industrialised countries. The demographic process would, no doubt, create a large and growing labour force.However, the window of opportunity provided by a relatively large and youngworkforce in India needs a conducive social policy environment for getting realised.In this context, it is recognised that further efforts are needed at accelerated pace tocreate a quality social infrastructure in terms of education and health which can helpthe easy and productive absorption of the prospective ''youth bulge''. Public policy isincreasingly aware of the need to give high priority to education and health and alsogenerating employment that is consistent with global competitiveness. In otherwords, to reap the rewards of demographic dividend, public-policy has a critical roleto play.(vi) Poverty and employment : The litmus testsThe growth story in any developing country is incomplete without assessing itsimpact on the poverty and employment situation. The number of people living belowthe poverty line in India has decreased from around 36 per cent in 1993-94 to 22.0per cent in 2004-05. The average decline in the percentage of people below thepoverty line over the period 1993-94 to 2004-05 is 0.74 percentage points per year.India has ranked 126th, in terms of human development index (HDI) according to theUNDP Human Development Report, 2006. The most daunting task for public policyis to ensure that adequate work is found for millions of poor people and in particularto the growing number of young persons.As per broad results of a recent job survey published in one of the popularmagazines, the current high growth phase is not a jobless growth, but now the jobsare created in almost all sectors as compared to the 1990s. According to the reportand other anecdotal evidence, the benefits of recent surge in growth rate of GDP arenot just restricted to large cities, but people in other urban and semi urban areas arealso gaining.While there is some evidence of reduction in under employment and disguisedunemployment in the informal sector and larger work opportunities, the provision ofproductive employment is of highest priority in India.5. Explorations on the Financial Sector(i) Strong and resilient banking sector: The way aheadWhile the broad objectives of the financial sector reforms were to enhance efficiencyand productivity, the process of reforms was initiated in a gradual and properlysequenced manner so as to have a reinforcing effect. The approach has been toconsistently upgrade the financial sector by adopting the international best practicesthrough a consultative process.The banking system in India has undergone significant changes during last 16 years.There have been new banks, new instruments, new windows, new opportunitiesand, along with all this, new challenges. While deregulation has opened up newvistas for banks to augment incomes, it has also entailed greater competition andconsequently greater risks. The traditional face of banks as mere financialintermediaries has since altered and risk management has emerged as the definingattribute. Banks have been provided significant operational freedom in their resourceallocation using their commercial judgements in a market oriented environment. Thecapital adequacy ratio has increased to 12.4 per cent for scheduled commercialbanks as at end March 2006, which is much above the international norm.Commercial banks\u2019 net profits were at 0.9 per cent of total assets during 2004-05and 2005-06, up from 0.16 per cent in 1995-96. The net non-performing assetsdeclined to 1.3 per cent of net advances during 2005-06 from 2.0 per cent in 2004-05. According to the preliminary financial results available for most of the banks forthe year 2006-07, the financial soundness has improved further.Our banking sector reform has been unique in the world in that it combines acomprehensive reorientation of competition, regulation and ownership in a non-disruptive and cost-effective manner. Indeed our banking reform is a good illustrationof the dynamism of the public sector in managing the overhang problems and thepragmatism of public policy in enabling the domestic and foreign private sectors tocompete and expand.The way ahead for the financial sector as whole, given the strong foundations andbasic institutional framework, relates to the pace of further deregulation andliberalisation, consistent with the progress of reform in the real and fiscal sectors.The Reserve Bank and the commercial banks have been preparing to implementBasel II.  In practice, within the given legal framework, priorities have to beappropriately set ensuring implementation of intended reforms in banking sector intune with the evolving domestic and external developments.(ii) Financial markets : Efficient and developingDevelopment of financial markets received a strong impetus from financial sectorreforms since the early 1990s.  Reforms in financial markets were carefullysequenced ensuring that they were in sync with the real sector. The reforms werealso important for developing the environment for effective monetary policy makingand monetary transmission mechanisms. As in other areas of reform, a gradualapproach was followed in respect of development of financial markets. This hasserved India well since it helps in continuous rebalancing of the various elementsdepending on global and domestic developments and thus maximises benefits whileminimising costs associated with the process of financial integration. In thisapproach, the pace and sequencing of financial liberalisation could be temperedkeeping in view the degree of comfort in moving forward in a credible way.Gradualism also enables harmonisation with reforms in other sectors of theeconomy.A wide range of regulatory and institutional reforms were introduced in a plannedmanner over a period to improve the efficiency of financial markets.  These includeddevelopment of market micro structure, removal of structural bottlenecks,introduction/ diversification  of new players/instruments, free pricing of financialassets, relaxation of quantitative restrictions,  better regulatory systems, introductionof new technology, improvement in trading infrastructure, clearing and settlementpractices and greater transparency. Prudential norms were introduced early in thereform phase, followed by interest rate deregulation and gradual lowering ofstatutory pre-emptions. These policies were supplemented by strengthening ofinstitutions, encouraging good market practices, rationalised tax structures andenabling legislative and accounting framework.Going forward, a judicious mix of appropriate policy, strong macro economy andsound and resilient financial system would be necessary as the Indian economymoves up in the ladder from an emerging market economy towards a more matureeconomy.  As development of financial markets is an ongoing process, initiatives tofurther deepen and widen the various segments of financial markets would have tobe continuously pursued. As the economy ascends a higher growth path, withgreater opening up and financial integration with the rest of the world, the financialsector development in all its aspects will need further scaling up along withcorresponding measures to continue regulatory modernisation and strengthening.Since the overall objective of maintaining price stability in the context of economicgrowth and financial stability will remain, the effort will be to harmonise thederegulation and liberalisation of financial markets with the domestic developmentsin real as well as fiscal sectors and global developments in international financialarchitecture.(iii) Capital account : Calibrated liberalisationDrawing on the experience of the past decade and a half, India\u2019s approach to capitalaccount liberalisation can be summarised as follows: First, capital accountliberalisation is treated as a process and not an event. Second, it is recognised thatthere may be links between the current and capital accounts and hence proceduresare in place to avoid capital flows in the guise of current account transactions. Third,capital account liberalisation is kept in tune with other reforms. The extent and timingof capital account liberalisation is properly sequenced with other concomitantdevelopments such as strengthening of banking, fiscal consolidation, marketdevelopment and integration, trade liberalisation, and the changing domestic andexternal economic environments. Fourth, the pace and sequencing of liberalisationis responsive to domestic developments, especially in the monetary and financialsectors, and the evolving international financial architecture. As liberalisationadvances, the administrative measures are reduced and price-based measures areincreased, but the freedom to change the mix and reimpose controls is demonstrablyavailable. Fifth, a hierarchy is established in the sources and types of capital flows.The priority has been to liberalise inflows relative to outflows, but all outflowsassociated with inflows have been totally freed. Sixth, significant liberalisation onoutflows on behalf of individuals, corporates, and mutual funds is underwayconsistent with significant strengthening of the external sector. Finally, whilepursuing the medium-term objective of fuller capital account liberalisation, currentlythe need for  pursuing controls of a prudential nature particularly on financialintermediaries and contextually, more active management of capital account is dulyrecognised.Going forward, India plans to continue its carefully calibrated gradualist approach asit enables harmonisation with reforms in other sectors of the economy. The pace offurther liberalisation will, however, depend on domestic factors, especially furtherprogress in reforms in real sector, fiscal consolidation, and the evolving financialarchitecture; and international developments in addition to achievement of certain'concomitants', indicated in the latest Tarapore Committee on the subject.6. Concluding RemarksFriends, I hope that I have given you a bird's eye view of performance of theIndian economy, in terms of growth and stability. As mentioned, there arechallenges, especially in the area of physical infrastructure, agriculture and deliveryof essential public services such as education and health. I have also explained thatthere are some grounds for optimism that we in India are on a path of self-accelerating developmental mode with some inherent and unique strengths. Thegrowth dynamics in India are led by widespread and well-dispersed entrepreneurialtalent with a penchant for innovation. It is a business-led growth with large networksof markets both in real economy and financial sector, transiting from emerging to afully mature status. The growth is led significantly by domestic demand \u2013 bothconsumption and investment. We have remarkable political system stability. India isa country of great diversities, but with incredibly harmonious coexistence of variousreligions, languages and a unified culture. Hence, personally, I believe that India hasinherent strengths, in terms of assimilating constructively, healthy, new anddiversified values to fit into the international systems very smoothly and efficiently.Let me conclude by thanking the organisers again for giving me thisopportunity to be with you and mutually benefit from the deliberations.", "27 Aug 10 MP.pdf": "Economic Crisis and Crisis in Economics Some Reflections1- Duvvuri Subbarao ___________________________________________________________________  M. Ct. M. Chidambaram   Thank you for this kind i nvitation. It is a pleasure  and privilege to deliver the M. Ct. M. Chidambaram Chettyar Memo rial Lecture honouring one of the most eminent entrepreneurs and financiers  of the early twentieth century.  2. The Chettyar community of Tamil Nadu has made impressive contributions to our national life. The stereotype view  is that the Chettyar community is conservative. But Shri M. Ct. M. Chidam baram broke that stereotype. His is the story of a visionary, ahead of his tim e who, through his thought and action, contributed to laying the foundations for transforming India from an agrarian society to an industrializing nation.  3. M Ct, as he was popularly known, was a true pioneer who did not let the restrictive economic environment of his time restrain his abounding spirit of enterprise. He started the United India Life Insurance, the first national level life insurance company; ventured  into general insurance th rough the United India Fire and General Insurance Company, establis hed a bank \u2013 the Indian Overseas Bank, and set up a large manufacturing unit \u2013 Travancore Rayon. M Ct thought big. The                                                  1 M. Ct. M. Chidambaram Chettyar Memorial Lecture delivered by Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, on August 27, 2010 LIC building on Anna Salai in Chennai that  he built remains iconic even today never mind that taller skyscrapers have since come up. I can go on with the list. What is impressive about this remarkable man is that he accomplished all this in an era of controls and regulations, and that too in a tragically short life span of just 46 years. That all these institutions survive to date is a tribute to M Ct\u2019s enduring legacy.   4. M Ct was quite the Renaissance man who let his life and work be influenced by learning from across disciplin es as well as from listening to a wide range of people. But as with any successf ul entrepreneur, in the end, he depended on his intuition and judgement \u2013 some may call it plain common sense \u2013 to determine his course of action. In that se nse, M Ct had unwittingly set a role model for policy makers. Good policy makers should get all the technical inputs and advice, but ultimately need to superimpos e their judgement on that analysis to reach policy decisions. This is something that M Ct mastered. The best way perhaps to pay tribute to M Ct is to convey to you how we struggle with making judgement calls on top of technical analys is in order to reach policy decisions.  5. For good economic policy, you need good economics. But you also need good judgement because no economic theory  can capture the complexity and capriciousness of the real world. And this is what I want to focus on in this lecture. In particular, I want to address two issues . In the first part of the lecture, I will address the question, has economics failed us. And in the second part, I will try to convey to you the dilemmas and the comple xities that policy makers confront in making judgement calls.  2 The Queen at LSE 6. A few months into the crisis, the Queen happened to be at the London School of Economics and asked a perfectly sensible question: \u2018how come none of the economists saw the crisis coming\u2019. The Queen\u2019s question resonated with people around the world who felt that they ha d been let down by economics and economists. As economists saw their profession discredited a nd their reputations dented, the economic crisis soon turn ed into a crisis in economics.   Crisis in Economics 7. This was a particularly hard landing for the profession. The years before the crisis, in fact, saw economics as a subject  gain impressively in  clout and popularity. The price stability and macroeconomic st ability that prevailed over an extended period - the Great Moderation \u2013 enhanced  the standing of economics and gave economists an enviable halo; the increas ing sophistication of financial markets where risk could seemingly be measured wi th precision of upto five decimal points gave economics the clout of prophesy; and the way economists were able to raise obscure questions such as why drug dealer s continue to live with their mothers, what school teachers and sumo wrestlers have in common, and answered those questions with impressive insights, awed common folk. Economists were being sought out to pronounce on an ever growing number of issues and their opinions were being heard with regard and trust.  And then the financ ial crisis came and crashed all this.    38. The sharp reversal in fortunes raises  two questions: what went wrong and what can be done about it. Both questions are complex; the first because it has too many answers and the second because it has too few. What I propose to do in this first part of this lecture is to address these two questions.   What Went Wrong With Economics? 9. Let me turn to the first question. What went wrong with economics? I am not an economist, only a practi tioner of economics. I will, th erefore, restrict myself to just the bigger maladies that, I think, afflict th e discipline.   10. With the benefit of hindsight and by wide agreement, it now seems that by far the most egregious fault of economics, one  that led it astray, has been to project it like an exact science. The charge is th at economists suffered from \u2018physics envy\u2019 which led them to formulate elegant theo ries and models \u2013 using sophisticated mathematics with impressive quantitative finesse -  deluding themselves and the world at large that their models have more exactitude  than they actually did.   Is Economics like Physics? 11. As I started thinking about this charge, I realized th at there are indeed quite a few parallels between economics and phys ics. Let me explore these parallels briefly.    (i) The theory of rational expectations  says that wages and prices adjust instantaneously to new conditions becau se of perfect information just as Newtonian physics says that the gravitational configurati on of the universe will change instantaneously in response to any infinitesimal change in the  4system, an inference that Einstein f ound troubling because it conflicted with his special theory of relativity.      (ii) The centerpiece of Keynes\u2019 theory is the existence of inescapable uncertainty about the future which im plies that risk cannot be measured precisely beyond a point, and that taki ng uncertainty seri ously has profound implications for how one applies econo mics. Look at the parallel in physics. The foundation of quantum mechanic s is Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle which puts an irreducible limit on our ability to simultaneously determine the position and mo mentum of a particle.   (iii) Physicists know of \u2018singu larities\u2019, or black holes if you will, where the laws of physics break down. In economics,  the analogy would be Depression Economics. There is currently a fierce debate, especially in the US, about the quantum of fiscal stimulus and the timing of its withdrawal. Some economists, notably Krugman, have argue d that the size of the stimulus should be much larger than what th e models suggest simply because \u2018in Depression Economics, the usual laws of economics do not apply\u2019.  Why Economics cannot be like Physics 12. Striking as these comparisons are, I am sure, you have noticed an obvious flaw in this line of thinking. Similarity in  a few laws does not mean similarity in the basic nature of the academic discipline. The fundamental difference between physics and economics is that physics deals with the physical universe which is governed by immutable laws, beyond the pa le of human behaviour. Economics, in contrast, is a social science whose laws are influenced by human behaviour. Simply put, I cannot change the mass of an el ectron no matter how I behave but I can change the price of a derivative by my behaviour.    513. The laws of physics are universal in space and time. The laws of economics are very much a function of the context. Going back to the earlier example, the mass of an electron does not change whethe r we are in the world of Newton or of Einstein. But in the world of economics,  how firms, households and governments behave is altered by the reigning economic ideology of the time. To give another example, there is nothing absolute, for example, about savings being equal to investment or supply equa ling demand as maintained by classical economics but there is something absolute about energy lost being equal to energy gained as enunciated by classical physics.   14. In natural sciences, progress is a two way street. It can run from empirical findings to theory or the other way round. The famous Michelson-Morley experiment that found that the velocity of light is constant led to the theory of relativity \u2013 an example of progression fr om practice to theory. In the reverse direction, the ferocious search now unde r way for the Higgs Boson \u2013 the God particle - which has been predicted by quant um theory is an example of traversing from theory to practice. In economi cs, on the other han d, where the human dimension is paramount, the progression has necessarily to be one way, from empirical finding to theory. There is a joke  that if something works in practice, economists run to see if it works in theory. Actually, I don\u2019t see the joke; that is indeed the way it should be.   15. Karl Popper, by far the most influential philosopher of science of the twentieth century, propounded that  a good theory is one  that gives rise to falsifiable  6hypotheses. By this measure, Einstein\u2019s Ge neral Theory was a good theory as it led to the hypothesis about the curvature of  space under the force of gravity which indeed was verified by scientists from observations made during a solar eclipse from the West African islands of Sao Tome and Principe. Economics on the other hand cannot stand the scrutiny of the fals ifiable hypothesis test since empirical results in economics are a function of the context.  16. The short point is that economics ca nnot lay claim to the immutability, universality, precision and exactitude of physics. Economics is a social science and its predictive power is at a fundamental  level influenced by human behaviour and actions. Let me now illustrate how real world behaves in capricious and unpredictable ways posing complex challenges for economic prediction.  (i) Take the recent financial crisis. It is  not as if no one saw the pressures building up. There were a respectable number of economists who warned of the perilous consequences of the build -up of global imbalances, said that this was simply unsustainable and predicted a currency collapse. In the event, we did have the system imploding but not as a currency collapse but as a melt down of the financial system.   (ii) Again, there was widespread apprehension that the financial crisis would be followed by a sovereign debt crisis under the weight of unprecedented government borrowing to finance the fiscal stimulus. We did get a sovereign debt crisis but not because  of stimulus led debt burden but because of fiscal profligacy in some European countries, notably Greece, made possible by the umbrella cover of a monetary union.      7 Economic Models 17. Moving on with what went wrong with economics, another flaw, actually one related to \u2018physics envy\u2019, is the obse ssion of economists with models so much so that they convinced themselves that if  something cannot be modeled, it is not fit enough for academic pursuit. Indeed, with the benefit of hindsight, it is now possible to see that one of the basic causes of the crisis was that the models used by central banks, such as even the sophisticated Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models, remained conf ined to the real sectors of the economy and did not capture the complexities of the financial markets. It is not surprising that economists missed seeing the crisis br ewing in the underbell y of the financial sector.   18. Yes, it is possible to construct beau tifully precise models but only if you assume that rational economic agents with perfect information are operating in free markets that always return to equilibrium. But none of these assumptions holds true in the real world; models of economists ar e mere abstractions of reality that are useful for understanding but woefully inadequate for predicti on. That is why good economists are those who superimpose judg ement on the predictions thrown up by models, a subject to which I will return  in the second part of my lecture.   19. Of all the economic theori es that came under attack after the crisis, the one that got the most grilling was the e fficient market hypothesis put forward by Eugene Fama of the Chicago School. Its central  tenet is that the price of a financial product captures all available information about it. The efficient market hypothesis  8did away with the unrealistic assumption of perfect information but it assumed perfect information about risk. An obvious inference of the theory is that risk is perfectly measureable, and if it can be m easured perfectly it makes eminent sense to use that measurement in economic decisions.   20. Not surprisingly, the efficient market hypothesis spurred furious model building based on the assumption that the distribution of risk is captured by the Gaussian bell curve. The spectacularly, al beit briefly, succe ssful Black-Scholes model for option pricing too was based on the normal distribution of risk and ignored the possibility of extreme events.   21. With the benefits of hindsight, it is now clear that the models used by governments, central banks and economic agen ts were flawed in many ways. First, the models assumed that the real world exhibits stability over time, and by extension that the future can be predicted from an extrapolation of the past and present trends. Students of physics will noti ce that this is akin to the Newtonian world view that God is, in fact, a cloc k-maker and the universe is nothing more than clockwork. Knowing the initial conditions , it is possible to predict the precise configuration of the universe for a ny point of time into eternity.   22. The second flaw was to believe that risk follows a normal distribution \u2013 a flaw that became evident by a series of failures, most prominently by the spectacular collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) based on the Black-Scholes model. As the much celebrated author Nassim Taleb argues, conventional models used by fina ncial economists not only didn\u2019t capture,  9but even refused to acknowledge, the possi bility of black sw ans - low probability, high impact events.   23. The third major flaw of financial m odels was that instead of fitting the models to the real world, they tried to fit the real world to the models. In the process, they assumed away the models \u2019 limitations and caveats. Convenience, and not conviction, dictated the choices th at economists made. As the Economist magazine put it so well, economists got seduced by their models, fooling themselves that what the models leave out does not matter. This penchant of economists to build models determined mo re by what they can rather than what they should is best illustrated by the joke th at I am sure most of you heard \u2013 about a drunkard who lost his keys and was searching for them under a lamp post not because he lost the keys there but because that is where light was.   What Can Be Done About It? 24. I realize I have straddled economics and physics somewhat erratically to convey to you what went wrong with economics. Now let me turn, if only briefly, to the follow on question about what can be done about it.   25. The first thing is for economics to give up the pretence of being an exact science and striving for false precision. While there is value to models for furthering understanding of  economic phenomena, economists should, however, be sensitive to the limitations of their models and use j udgment in interpreting model results. And we clearly need to get back to emphasizing the importance of economists \u2018getting their hands dirty\u2019 with empirical work.   10 26. Then there is the crucial aspect of economic history. Much of economic thinking has been handicapped by economists not having a sense of economic history. In their painstak ingly researched book, \u2018 This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly \u2019, Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart show how over eight hundred years, all financial crises  can be traced to the same fundamental causes as if we learnt nothi ng from one crisis to the next. Each time, experts have chimed that \u2018this time is different\u2019 clai ming that the old rule s do not apply and the new situation is dissimilar to the previ ous one. If only training in economics had included a study of economic history, perh aps we could have avoided repeating history, never mind as a fa rce or as a tragedy.    27. Finally, economics, perhaps more than other social sciences, has suffered from \u2018group think\u2019. Group think is best illustrated by the simulated game of a beauty contest where prizes are awarde d if your choice matches the aggregate choice of the group. Under this rule, you get rewarded not for original thinking but for mastering the art of thinking like ot hers. Keynes made the point a long time ago, comparing market psychology to a beau ty contest: \u201cIt is  not the case of choosing those which, to the best of one\u2019s judgement, are really the prettiest, nor even those which average opinion genuine ly thinks are the prettiest\u2026 we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be.\u201d Might it be the case that econom ics is suffering from too much inbreeding? Economists all read the same books, browse  the same journals and use the same  11data because that is what gets professiona lly rewarded. And that inevitable leads to \u2018group think\u2019 and all the associated follies.  Applying Economics to Real World Policy 28. While I have spoken about the follies of economics, I am hardly suggesting that we can do away with economics. Indeed  economics needs to be pursued as an academic discipline even more vigorously but we need to be more intelligent and aware in translating textbook economics to practical policy making. In applying economics to practical policy, a sound economic background is necessary. Models too are needed to capture the complexitie s of the real world. But these are not sufficient. In making economic decisions , practical policy makers need to superimpose judgment on the inferences th rown up by analysis and models. I want to illustrate this by presenting to you the rationale behind the Reserve Bank\u2019s calibrated exit from the expansionary monetary stance of the crisis and the policy dilemmas that we confront.   Calibrated Exit from Expansionary Monetary Stance 29. Not unsurprisingly, emerging market  economies (EMEs) recovered from the global crisis sooner than advanced economies \u2013 an outcome attributable in part to the relatively limited exposure of their banking systems to tainted assets and in part to the self-insurance they had built up through foreign exchange reserves.      12India\u2019s recovery 30. On the recovery trail, India has b een an outlier even compared to other EMEs. Our recovery has been swifter reinfo rcing the fact that the drivers of our growth are largely domestic. We have been an outlier on the inflation front as well. Even as most advanced economies were flirting with deflation, price pressures caught up with us and headline inflation started inching up.   31. Sensing our unique growth-inflati on dynamics, the Reserve Bank began managing market expectations by signal ling the need to exit from the crisis triggered expansionary stance even as the re st of the world was still struggling with crisis management. Ironically, we had to be gin this messaging about exit as early as August 2009, when our headline inflation wa s still in the nega tive territory and some analysts were even talking about a risk of deflation.  October - December 2009 32. Sure enough, WPI inflati on surfaced into positiv e territory by September 2009, and soon started increasing. Even as th e reversal owed partly to the base effect, inflationary pressures were also  fuelled by supply shocks arising from a deficient monsoon. The challenge for th e Reserve Bank during the October-December quarter of 2009 was to respond to a hardening inflation situation even as recovery was still fragile.  33. The arguments for not yet reversing the policy stance were clear enough: recovery had yet to take firm root and also  that monetary policy is not an effective tool against inflation emanating from supply constraints. There was an equally  13persuasive case to the contrary \u2013 of ti ghtening the monetary stance to combat inflation. Given that monetary policy acts w ith a lag \u2013 a lag that can be as long as 12-18 months \u2013 the argument was that the Reserve Bank needed to look ahead and curb incipient inflationary pressures. The Reserve Bank, it was contended, also had to keep a watch on inflation expectations since the inflation outlook will be shaped by what people expect will happen to inflation as much as by the actual inflation itself.   34. Balancing these arguments for and ag ainst reversal was the crux of the judgement call that the Reserve Bank ha d to make in the October 2009 policy review. If we were to begin the reversal  of the accommodative stance, we had to be credible. And this is where real life polic y differs from physics. Once a central bank credibly commits to a reve rsal of an expansionary stance, firms and households change their behaviour. How this behaviour changes also needs to be factored in by the central bank. In the event, we revers ed the expansionary stance by raising the SLR requirement to the pre-crisis leve l of 25 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of scheduled commerc ial banks. This was admittedly a modest step but helped us in signalling the begi nning of the reversal of our monetary stance.   January-March 2010 35. By the time of our January 2010 policy review, it was clear that we had to take more substantive steps towards roll ing back the stimulus. Our main dilemma was that premature exit could derail the as yet fragile growth, but delayed exit  14could potentially engender inflation expectations. The task was about the precise calibration of the policy action. Increase in policy interest rates cannot be effective if there is a large systemic liquidity. We determined therefore that the right sequencing would be to withdraw the excess liquidity before raising policy rates. Accordingly, we raised the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 75 basis points from 5 per cent to 5.75 per cent of NDTL.   36. The growth-inflation dynamics cha nged markedly after the January 2010 policy review. Economic recovery was taki ng firm hold as evidenced by expanding exports, improvement in industrial production and sustained incr ease in financing from banks and non-banks. On the other ha nd, there were distinct signs of the inflation process getting more generalized. Information then available indicated that the contribution of non-food to WPI infla tion (excluding food articles and food products) which was zero in November  2009 surged to nearly 50 per cent by February 2010. Also, year-on-year non-f ood manufacturing products inflation, with a weight of 52 per cent in the WPI basket , which was (-) 0.4 per cent in November 2009 rose sharply to 4.5 per cent by February 2010 evidencing incipient demand side pressures. We determined that we had to act quickly before inflation expectations get further entrenched. A ccordingly, in an unscheduled and mid-quarter policy action, we raised the policy interest rates by 25 basis points raising the reverse repo rate to 3.5 per cent and the repo rate to 5.0 per cent.        15April 2010 and beyond 37. Monetary theory tells us  that if prices come under pressure because of strengthening demand, monetary  tightening has to take place. But monetary policy does not offer a template for when to tighten, how to tighten and how much to tighten. This remains a judgement call. We face this dilemma all the time but did so most acutely during the Annual Policy Review in April 2010. Year-on-year WPI non-food manufactured products inflation had moved up further from 4.5 per cent in February 2010 to 5.4 per cent in March 2010 evidencing clearly that demand side pressures on inflation were strengthening.   38. To understand the demand side pressures in perspective, we need to go back two years to August 2008, a month before th e global crisis struck. At that time inflation in the country was raging well a bove double digits. Some of it was due to the unprecedented rise in global crude a nd commodity prices, but a significant portion of it was also due to sizzling grow th in an economy that was structurally capacity constrained across the entire spectrum \u2013 infrastructure, agriculture, industry and services. Then came the crisis and the monetary and fiscal stimuli in response. A part of the stimulus was aimed at supporting investment, and public and private infrastructure investment did i ndeed increase, but much of the stimulus ended up supporting consumption. This help ed the economy weather the crisis but the supply constraints remained. As a re sult, when recovery started and demand pressures started building up, capacity c onstraints started becoming increasingly evident.    1639. So, at the time of the April 2010 po licy review, we had to balance the by now well-known arguments in managing the growth-inflation dynamics. Some analysts had argued that we were alr eady behind the curve and that unless we tightened substantively, th e economy ran the risk of a hard landing \u2013 which is to say that we were boxing ourselves into a corner, that delayed response would mean much sharper increase in intere st rates later on and that will severely impair growth.   40. Even as we were managing the macro economic situation at home, we had to be mindful of global developments. The Great Recession in the advanced economies appeared to have reversed course by mid-September 2009 and some calm seemed to return to the global markets. It was widely expected that the recovery would be sluggi sh; but subsequent devel opments belied even these modest expectations. While recovery pr ospects in Europe remain clouded by sovereign debt concerns, recovery in  US appears constrained by consumer spending and private investment not picking up sufficiently to offset the impact of the waning stimulus. We had to factor in  these developments too in calibrating our exit path.  41. Keeping these domestic and external developments in view, in our April 2010 Policy review, we raised the CRR by a further 25 basis points to 6 per cent and the policy rates too by 25 basis point s each. We followed that up with two policy actions in July 2010 further ra ising the policy interest rates.   42. To summarize, as part of crisis management starting October 2008, we reduced the CRR by 400 basis points, the re po rate by 425 basis points and the  17 18reverse repo rate 275 basis points. As part  of the calibrated exit starting October 2009, we raised CRR by 100 basis points, the repo rate by 100 basis points and the reverse repo by 125 basis points.  It must be noted that on top of this, there has been some autonomous tightening of 150 basis points because of the tightened liquidity and the consequent shift of the operative  policy rate from the bottom of the LAF corridor (absorption mode) to the top of the corridor (injection mode).  43. Some critics contend that the Reserve Bank is \u2018behind the curve\u2019. Others put it differently saying that we are yet a distance away from the \u2018neutral rates\u2019. This criticism obviously presumes a notion of  the shape of the curve or the neutral rates. This is a complex debate to pursue in the Indian context. Technically, the \u2018neutral rate of interest\u2019 is an impor tant concept in monetary policy and a potentially useful guide to monetary policy stance. The neutral rate is defined as a rate that is consistent with the economy \u2019s potential growth and low and stable inflation. The actual policy rate will, theref ore, differ from the theoretical neutral rate if the underlying parameters - actual gr owth and inflation - are away from their respective potential or target rates. The neutral rate evidently varies over time as the potential growth rate of the economy change s - which in turn is  typically a function of the demographic profile, the fiscal st ance of the government and technological changes. In a rapidly growing economy like that of India, the structural changes make the potential growth rate even more  variable. That makes the neutral rate even more difficult to estimate and a less useful policy guide.        Policy Rates \u2013 During and After Crisis (September 2008 \u2013 August 2010)     Crisis Management  Calibrated Exit     Variable  Rates in September 2008 (before crisis)  Reduction as part of crisis management (Oct. 2008 - Sept. 2009) (basis points)  Rates in  September 2009  Increase as part of calibrated exit  (Oct. 2009 - Aug. 2010) (basis points)   Rates in  August 2010   CRR  9%  400          5%  100        6%  Repo 9% 425 4.75% 100 5.75%  Reverse Repo  6% 275 3.25% 125 4.50%         Outlook 44. What is the outlook? There is eviden ce that growth is getting more broad based. Inflationary pressures too are easi ng because of improved supply position as also the impact of mone tary tightening effected by the Reserve Bank. Going forward, the Reserve Bank will calibrate policy action to the evolving growth-inflation dynamics. Given the uncertainty in the world and the lags in monetary transmission, it is not possible to offer more  precise guidance. All I can say is that our guide post is festina lente  \u2013 as the Romans used to say \u2013 make haste slowly.   45. One final point as I close this issue.  The Reserve Bank has to balance between the objectives of growth, price st ability and financial stability with the inters\u00e9 prioritization determined by the macroeconomic context. Determining this prioritization is the judgem ent call of the Reserve Bank. People who apprehend that monetary tightening will hurt growth must remember that even if there is some sacrifice of output in the near-term, we are better off curbing inflation since inflation can be inimical to sustainable and equitable growth in the medium term.  Conclusion  46. Let me now conclude. I started with the Queen\u2019s query to economists about the shortcomings of their trade, went  on to sketch the perils of economics positioning itself as an exact science and argued that economic thinking has to be conditioned by human behaviour. I then  explained how, in economic policy formulation, we need to use judgement ove r the results of analysis and modeling to decide among policy choices.  47. Since so much of my talk has been shaped by comparing economics to physics, let me also conclude with a parall el between the two disciplines. Physics, an exact science, explores known unknowns. Economics, a social science, deals with unknown unknowns. We all know that all through his life, Einstein remained skeptical about quantum mechanics. In pa rticular, he could not reconcile to the probabilistic nature of the physical world implied by quant um physics and famously said that \u2018God does not play di ce\u2019. Less well known perhaps is the retort of Neils Bohr who told Einstein, \u2018Albert,  stop telling God what he can or cannot do\u2019. Economists have a much humbler remit.  They cannot even tell man, let alone God, what he can or cannot do. They just have to take human behaviour as given and pursue their trade on that fundamental premise.   21", "11 Aug 23.pdf": "1  Closing Remarks by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor, RBI  at the Seminar on Global Economy: Challenges, Opportunities and Way Forward   organised by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India, August 11, 2023, Mumbai   Today\u2019s seminar on Global Economy: Challenges, Opportunities, and the Way Forward , held as part of the International Financial Architecture (IFA) and Framework Working Groups (FWG) workstreams under India\u2019s G20 Presidency , including the three panel  discussions  have yielded rich and insightful thoughts  on (i) financing development and global public goods ; (ii)  tackling global debt vulnerabilities ; and (iii) the key risks to the global economy . All these issues are priorities under India\u2019s G 20 Presidency . I take this opportunity to thank all the participants for enhancing the quality of discussion s during the day .   2. Today, Policy makers across the world are grappling with multifarious and intertwined challenges in ensuring post -pandemic recovery in the face of elevated inflation, financial market vulnerabilities , reduced policy headroom and geopolitical tensions.  In this milieu, India\u2019s  G20 Presidency aims at enhancing global cooperation to face such common challenges . This is embodied in the Preside ncy theme of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam  \u2013 \u201cOne Earth- One Family -One Future\u201d. This theme underlines the importance of global public goods for common prosperity of all.   3. Global Public Goods (GPGs) play a crucial role in shaping development al strategies  and securing human welfare across borders 2  and generations . Financing them has become a critical issue in the wake of the COVID -19 pandemic , the highly unsettled geopolitical environment, climate change, fractures in international supply chains , and tectonic shifts in financi al market conditions and global liquidity.  Given the confluence of such factors , global financial stability  is gaining prominence in the hierarchy  of global public goods.    4. India\u2019s experience has shown how Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) can be utilised for advancing financial inclusion and productivity gains  through cost reductions . Our sustained engagement in the India Stack and the Unified Payments Interface (UPI ), especially during the pandemic and thereafter, has filled us with the conviction that digital public infrastructure like the UPI can become a critical part of global public goods when scaled  up beyond national borders .   5. While the UPI has been a public  sector led  initiative, it is not necessary that public goods can only be developed and fi nanced by the public sector . The p rivate sector needs to engage in the provision of GPGs not just because they create an enabling ecosystem for businesses to thrive but also because they would be a commercially viable endeavour. In this regard, it is worth while to build innovative design features which private investors  find attractive in financing  of GPGs . In the investment cascade, keeping in view the very large investment requirements, the trigger financing can come from public investment . This would  help in minimizing risk  and expanding market access. S ubsequent financing needs can be met by the private sector. This is where international capital flows and movements  assume importance . Hence, risk sharing sh ould be an important design element 3  in fost ering private financing for global public goods . In this endeavour, Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) could catalyse private sector investment through risk sharing mechanisms .  6. Recent fault lines in global cooperation have  led to under -provisioning of global public goods and erosion of economic welfare. Absence of seamless access to COVID -19 vaccines is a case in point. Similarly, the lack of timely financial support and creditor cooperation can explain, even if partly, the rising debt s tress in some developing economies.  High and unsustainable debt levels have severely constrained many countries , limiting their fiscal capacity . While  the G20-led initiatives such as  the Common Framework (CF) for debt treatment  and the Debt Service Suspens ion Initiative (DSSI) have been discussed intensely , significant progress beyond these have to be achieved. I would like to make three specific suggestions in this context.   7. First, it is essential that Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) for countries is realistic on growth  and fiscal projections are fully founded on accurate and comprehensive debt data. A global debt data -sharing platform can help in this regard. Establishing such a platform could be very challenging and may take several years . In the interregnum , therefore, we may  examine the possibility of constructing suitable proxies for debt flows . Such proxies may be derived from data on capital flows and locational banking statistics from sources such as the Institute of International Finance (IIF) and the Bank for International Settlements  (BIS) .   4  8. Second, a multilateral debt relief program providing targeted assistance to low -income countries with high debt levels needs to be considered  on a priority basis . This initiative can be designed with a  clear focus on utilisation of debt relief for sustainable development projects and poverty reduction efforts. To this end, instruments such as debt-for-development swaps1 and green debt relief programs2 could be employed.   9. Third, the crucial role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in addressing global debt vulnerabilities cannot be overstated. These institutions are at the centre of international monetary and financial system. H ence it is incumbent upon them to do more for countri es in debt distress. At present, the IMF \u2019s precautionary programmes such as the Precautionary Lending Line are available for countries with sound macro -fundamentals; however, there is little reason for countries with strong macro- fundamentals to seek Precautionary Lines. Further,  Stand- By Arrangements (SBAs) are offered for countries with a balance of payments crisis ; but S BAs come with performance benchmarks, and the attendant stigma. This is an important issue , as the recent experience shows how the perceived stigma of and/or lack of access to IMF programme s can cause countries to seek support from other lenders  rather than the IMF , with debt sustainability consequences .  It may be helpful if programs can  be designed with less conditionalit y for countries with macro -fundamentals                                              1 To support countries transitioning to low- carbon and climate- resilient economies through debt swaps that link debt relief to the implementation of environmentally friendly policies and projects. 2 Creditors offer debt reductions or write- offs in exchange for investments in projects that promote environmental sustainability, social development, and economic growth.  5  that are not sound but reasonably resilient , if they are not marred by balance of payment s stress .   10. The key point I am trying to stress is that corrective measures , including financing, should be put in place in a timely , non -stigmatised and more open access basis. For this purpose, a bigger and stronger IMF that is capable of managing the levels of country risk assumes crucial importance. Since the IMF\u2019s support is linked to the quota size of countries , the 16th general review of quotas and its attendant requirements, including governance reform, need to be completed expeditiously . Besides enhancing the legitimacy of the IMF in its oversight of the international monetary and financial system, this will increase traction f or the IMF\u2019s policy advice.  We must not allow the burden of debt to stifle the potential for global growth.    11. In this connection, t he panel discussion on key risks to global growth, namely, inflation, financial stability and climate change, assumes topical relevance . Even as the global economic outlook is marred by risks to the downside, long -term structural challenges such as climate change must be addressed , through supply of adequate and affordable financing for green transition.   12. We must , however, be mindful of the potential financial stability implications  of green transition . The transition efforts must address both the physical and transition risks of climate change. Smooth and orderly green transition is necessary to avoid disruptions to economi c activity and loss of growth potential. While  the investment needs for smooth green transition are large, the actual financial flows to green projects 6  are highly skewed and are , by and large, concentrated in Advanced Economies. There is an urgent need to enhance green capital flows to EMDEs. As noted by the IMF in the recent Global Financial Stability Report, the green flows to EMDEs are curtailed by inadequate supply of green rated investment projects . While  green flows today are dependent on ESG ratings, recent research shows that these ESG ratings do not adequately reflect financial and non -financial materialit ies of these investments. Therefore, there is a need to ensure that \u201cgreen ratings\u201d reflect the ac tual environmental impact of the projects so as to avoid green -washing.   13. A crucial aspect of this effort is ensuring private financing for climate transition efforts through globally comparable and transparent disclosure norms and taxonomy of green activit ies. The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) is actively working on these aspects.   14.  While efforts are underway to improve and deepen green financing, it is equally critical to fortify regulatory frameworks that enable the implementation of climate taxonomy across jurisdictions , prevent greenwashing and facilitate sufficient green capital inflows to EMDEs .  A comprehensive and collaborative approach involving governments, private sector entities, financial institutions, civil society organi zations, and the general public is essential  for ensuing a successful transition to a sustainable future.   15. Let me now conclude by saying that structural challenges such as financing global public goods, managing global debt vulnerabilities 7  and dealing with climate transition are uphill task s which no country can achieve alone. Recommitting to multilateralism is the need of the hour and th is is precisely what the Indian Presidency of G20 is trying to foster. It is also important to take note of people- centri c transformative changes taking place in member countries like the UPI  and the financial inclusion initiatives in India. Wider adoption of such models would make the world a better place for everyone.   Thank you.   ", "27 Apr 10 MP.pdf": "India and the Global Financial Crisis Transcending from Recovery to Growth1  Duvvuri Subbarao  ______________________________ ___________________________  India clocked average growth of 9 per cent per annum in the five years to 2007/08. That growth momentum was interrupted by the financia l crisis which impacted India too, more than we had originally thought but less than it did mo st other countries. Despite falling below 6 per cent for one quarter, the growth for the full year 2008/09 was a resilien t 6.7 per cent. Current estimates are that the economy had grown between  7.2 and 7.5 per cent for th e just ended fiscal year 2009/10 and that growth for 2010/11 will be  8+ per cent. The quick turn in sentiment following the uncertainty and anxiet y of the crisis period  has seen the return  of the FAQ: When will India get on to double digit growth?  2. For policy makers, the FAQ transl ates to three nuanced questions: (i) In the short term, how do we restore the economy to its trend rate of growth while maintaining price stability?  (ii) In the medium term, how do we raise the trend rate of gr owth itself without compromising financial stability?   (iii) How do we ensure that growth is inclusive? 3. India is such an over analyzed country that it is difficult to be original. The answers to all the three questions above are all out there in th e open, and they involve moving on with a host of structural and governance reforms. I want to us e this platform provided by the Peterson Institute to comment on a few issues on the reform agenda th at are relevant to the Reserve Bank of India.                                                  1 Comments of Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of  India at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington DC, April 26, 2010.  2Capital flows 4. Volatile capital flows have been a central is sue during the crisis, and continue to be so now as the crisis is ebbing. Emerging market economies (EMEs) saw a sudden stop and reversal of capital flows during the crisis as a conse quence of global deleveraging. Now the trend has reversed once again, and many EMEs are seeing ne t inflows - a consequenc e of a global system awash with liquidity, the assu rance of low interest rates in advanced economies over \u2018an extended period\u2019 and the prospects of robust gr owth in EMEs. The familiar question of how EMEs can maximize the benefits and minimize the co sts of volatile capital flows has returned to haunt the policy agenda. 5. One little known aspect  of capital flows, what  could perhaps be calle d the law of capital flows, is that they never come in at the prec ise time or in the exact quantity you want them.  Managing these flows, especially if they are volat ile, is going to test the effectiveness of central bank policies of semi-open EMEs. If central ba nks do not intervene in the foreign exchange market, they incur the cost of currency appreciation unrelated to fundamentals. If they intervene in the forex market to prevent appreciation, th ey will have additional systemic liquidity and potential inflationary pressures to  contend with. If they sterilize the resultant liquidity, they will run the risk of pushing up intere st rates which will hurt the growth prospects. Capital flows can also potentially impair financial stability. How EMEs manage the im possible trinity - the impossibility of having an open cap ital account, a fixed exchange ra te and independent monetary policy - is going to have an impact on their prospects for growth, price stability and financial stability.  6. India has followed a consistent policy on cap ital account convertibility in general and on capital account management in particular. Our positio n is that capital account convertibility is not a standalone objective but a means for hi gher and stable growth. We believe our economy  3should traverse towards capital convertibility along a gradual path - the path itself being recalibrated on a dynamic basis in response to do mestic and global developments. Post-crisis, that continues to be our policy. We will cont inue to move towards liberalizing our capital account, but we will revisit the road map to reflect the lessons of the crisis.   7. India\u2019s approach to managing capital flow s too has been pragmatic, transparent and contestable. We prefer long term  flows to short-term flows and non-debt flows to debt flows. The logic for that is self-evident. Our policy on e quity flows has been quite liberal, and in sharp contrast to other EMEs which liberalized and then  reversed the liberaliza tion when flows became volatile, our policy has been quite stable. Histori cally, we have used policy levers on the debt side of the flows to manage volatility. This has b een our anchor when we had to deal with flows largely in excess of the economy\u2019s absorption capaci ty in the years before the crisis. This has been our policy when we saw large outflows during the crisis. And I believe this will continue to be our policy on the way forward. 8. The surge in capital flows into some EMEs even as the crisis is not yet fully behind us has seen the return of the familiar question - the advisability of imposing a Tobin type tax on capital flows. Both before and after the crisis , there are examples of countries, notably Chile, Colombia, Brazil and Malaysia, whic h have experimented with a T obin tax or its variant. Even as there are some lessons to be drawn from the country experience, on the aggregate, it does not constitute a sufficient body of knowledge for drawing definitive conclusions.  9. Critics of Tobin tax contend that the tax is in effective, is difficult to implement, easy to evade and that its costs far exceed the potential be nefits, and all this because financial markets always outsmart policy makers. Su pporters of the tax argue that  if designed and implemented well, the tax can be effective in smoothing flows a nd that evading controls is not such a straight  4forward option as efforts to evade require incurri ng additional costs to move funds in and out of a country which is precisely wh at the tax aims to achieve.   10. In India, given the overall thrust of po licy, we are quite agnostic on the choice of different instruments. The stereotype view is that we have an expre ss preference for quantity based controls over price based controls. A critical  examination of our policy will show that this view is mistaken. For example, on bonds we impose both a limit on the amount foreigners can invest as well as a withholdi ng tax. Similarly, our policy on ex ternal commercial borrowing employs both price and quantity vari ables. We have not so far im posed a Tobin type tax nor are we contemplating one. However, it needs reiterating that no policy instrument is clearly off the table and our choice of instruments will be determined by the context.  11. The recent crisis has clearly  been a turning point in the world view on capital controls. The Asian crisis of the mid-90s demonstrated th e risk of instability inherent in a fully open capital account. Even so, the in tellectual orthodoxy continued to  denounce controls on capital flows as being inefficient and ineffective. Th e recent crisis saw, across emerging economies, a rough correlation between the extent  of openness of the cap ital account and the extent of adverse impact of the crisis. Surely, this should not be  read as a denouncement of open capital account, but a powerful demonstration of the tenet that premature opening hurts more than it helps.  12. Notably, the IMF published a policy note in February 20102 that reversed its long held orthodoxy. The note has referred to certain \u2018 circumstances in which capital controls can be a legitimate component of the policy re sponse to surges in capital flows \u2019. Now that there is agreement that controls can be \u2018 desirable and effective\u2019  in managing capital flows in select                                                  2 Ostry, Jonathan D. and Others (2010), \u201cCapital Inflows: The Role of Controls\u201d, IMF Staff Position Note, SPN/10/04, February 19, 2010.  5circumstances, the IMF and other internationa l bodies must pursue rese arch on studying what type of controls are appropriate and under what circumstances so that emerging economies have useful guidelines to info rm policy formulation.  Exchange Rate Management 13. Just as on capital flows, on exchange rate t oo, our policy has been consistent which is that we do not target a specific rate or level for the exchange rate. The Reserve Bank intervenes in the market only to smooth volatility which is harmful to trade and investment. The \u2018volatility centric approach\u2019 to exchange rate also stems from th e source of volatility which is capital flows. Despite not having a fully open cap ital account, we have experien ced large volatility in capital flows as the following figures for the external sect or for the four years to  2009-10 demonstrate.   Trends in India\u2019s External Sector  2006/07 2007/08 2008/09 2009/10  CAD (% of GDP)  1.0 1.3 2.4 2.5 Net Capital flows  (% of GDP)  4.8 8.7 0.6 3.8 Capital flows in excess of CAD ($ billion)  36 92   (-)   20 14 Rupee appreciation (+) depreciation (-) vis-\u00e0-vis US$ during the year  2.3 9.0 (-)  21.5 12.9  Note: Numbers for 2009/10 are rough estimates.  14. The above numbers show that capital flows were in excess of the current account deficit in the years before the crisis during India\u2019s grow th boom and that they had abruptly reversed in the crisis year 2008/09. The full balance of paymen ts for the just completed fiscal year 2009/10 is not yet available but latest data show that the net accreti on to reserves was modest.   6 15. The above numbers and trends are a demonstr ation of our policy st ance. First, the two way movement shows that we have a flexible ex change rate, and also evidences the increasing flexibility of the rate over time in re lation to the magnitude of flows.    16. Second, India does not have a deliberate strategy of building up reserves for \u2018self-insurance\u2019. The variations in our foreign exchange reserves are an  offshoot of our exchange rate policy which is to intervene in the market only to smooth exchange rate volatility and prevent disruptions to macroeconomic st ability. Third, even as our reserves got built up over the years owing to capital flows, the same reserves have been used to contain volatility in the event of capital reversals. Importantly, given our persistent  trade and current account  deficits, our foreign exchange reserves comprise borrowed funds whic h are qualitatively different from accumulation of reserves through trade and current account surpluse s.  Even so, it is clear that the reserves have helped us better cope with  external sector vulnerabilities.  17. Our fairly flexible exchange rate policy has not been wit hout costs. Importantly, because inflation in India has typically b een higher than that in our tradi ng partners in th e recent period, the real effective exchange rate has appreciated  significantly more than the nominal rate. This has implications for our external competitiveness,  that too at a time when the world trade is recovering amid concerns relating to  protectionism. Also if we have  a flexible exchange rate, and if other countries which are our  trading partners or those wh ich compete for the same export markets have a fixed exchange rate, we get disadvantaged.  Inflation targetting 18. The Reserve Bank is not a pure inflation targe tter. Some people have suggested that the economy will be better served if the Reserve Bank becomes a pure inflation targetter. The  7argument is that inflation hurts much more in a country like India with hundreds of millions of poor people and that the Reserve Bank will be more effective at combating inflation if it is not burdened with other objectives. Th is argument is contestable.   19. Inflation targeting, charac terized by a single target (p rice stability) and a single instrument (short term policy interest rate), has respectable academic credentials. An exclusive commitment to inflation enhances operational effectiveness and enforces accountability. The success of several developed econo my central banks in maintaining price stability in the years before the crisis has also given it intellect ual credibility. The unravelling of the \u2018Great Moderation\u2019 during the crisis has however dilu ted, if not dissolved, the consensus around the minimalist formula of inflation targeting. The cr isis has shown that pr ice stability does not necessarily ensure financial stability. Indeed there is an even stronger assertion - that there is a trade-off between price stability and financial stability, and that the more successful a central bank is with price stability, the more likel y it is to jeopardize financial stability.   20. Inflation targeting is neithe r desirable nor practical in I ndia for a variety of reasons: \u2022 First, it is inconceivable th at in an emerging economy like India, the central bank can drive a single goal oblivious of  the larger development context. The Reserve Bank must be guided simultaneously by the objectives of price stability, financial stability and growth.   \u2022 Second, food items which have a large weight (46 - 70 per cent) in the various consumer prices indices are subject to large supply shoc ks, especially because of the vagaries of the monsoon, and are therefore beyond the pale of monetary policy. An inflation targeting RBI cannot do much to tame a supply driven in flation except as a line of defence in an extreme situation.   \u2022 Third, which inflation index do we target? In India, we ha ve one wholesale price index and four consumer price indices. There are ong oing efforts at a technical level to reduce  8the number of consumer price indices, and I believe the technical issues are not insurmountable. But that still will not give us a single representative inflation rate for an emerging market economy with market impe rfections, diverse geography and 1.2 billion people.   \u2022 Fourth, the monetary transmission mechanism in India is impeded because of a number of structural factors.  In flation targetting can be effi cient and effective only after monetary transmission becomes streamlined.   \u2022 Finally, we need to manage the monetary fall -out of volatile capital  flows that queer the pitch for a single focus monetary policy. A boom -bust pattern of capital flows can lead to large disorderly movements in exchange rates rendering both infl ation targeting and financial stability vulnerable. Like other emerging economies, India too will have to navigate the impossible trin ity as best as it can.   21. Post crisis, the \u2018new environment hypothesis\u2019 wh ich says that flexible  inflation targetting, rather than pure inflation targetting, is more efficient is gaining ground. According to this hypothesis, if inflation is way of f target, a central bank\u2019s first ca ll is to bring it within the acceptable range, and if inflation is within the range, the central bank can focus on other objectives.   22. The Reserve Bank\u2019s \u2018multiple indicator fr amework\u2019 adopted in 1998 and refined since then, in fact, subsumes a flexible inflation objective framework over the medium-term. Under this framework, while we strive for a balanc e among multiple objectives with the relative weights assigned to each objective varying as dict ated by the prevailing macroeconomic context, we aim to achieve a medium-term inflation target . Our commitment in th is regard is clearly defined in our own policy documents where we say our objective is to \u201ccontain perception of inflation in the range of 4.0 to 4.5 per cent in line with the medium -term objective of 3.0 per cent inflation consistent with India\u2019s broader integration with the global economy\u201d. Admittedly, our  9communication strategy is not yet best practice. We need to work, and indeed we are working, on improving dissemination, both at technical and non-technical leve ls. In the dissemination, we need to explain the inflation out look, the priority assigned to di fferent objectives, what impact our policy actions are inte nded to have and how they will take us towards the stated objectives.   Harmonizing Monetary and Fiscal Policies 23. One of the mega trends in macroeconomic  management world over in the last few decades has been the gradual abatement of the fiscal dominance of monetary policy. This has been the trend in India too. The ebbing away of fiscal dominance has been a continuous process but two discrete events marked significant mile stones. The first was the agreement between the Reserve Bank and the Government to completely  phase out ad-hoc treasury bills from April 1997, a move that saw the termina tion of the egregious practice of automatic monetization by the central bank of the government\u2019s fiscal deficit.  The second was the enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Mana gement (FRBM) Act which, among ot her things, prohibited the Reserve Bank from financing government debt in the primary market with effect from April 2006.  These trends got a further boost as a re sult of the fiscal consolidation during 2004-08 which yielded space for monetary policy. The hea lthy transition of monetary policy from fiscal dominance to functional autonomy was halted, if  not reversed, by the re sponse to the crisis, which necessitated fiscal expansion and monetary  accommodation of that hi gher fiscal deficit. 24. In India, both the Government and the Rese rve Bank have begun the pr ocess of exit from the expansionary stances of the crisis peri od. The Government has pr ogrammed a reduction in the gross fiscal deficit from 6.8 pe r cent of GDP in fiscal year 2009/10 to 5.5 per ce nt of GDP in 2010/11. The Reserve Bank began the reversal of its crisis re sponse accommodative stance by terminating sector-specific liquidity facilities, in crementally raising the cash and liquidity reserve  10ratios and the policy interest rate s. Going forward, the ch allenge for India, as it indeed is for every country, is to unwind the expansionary  policies harmoniously since inconsistencies between fiscal and monetary policies can be costly in economic terms.  25. As indicated earlier, th e two crisis years - 2008/ 09 and 2009/10 - saw government borrowing rising sharply and abruptly. Even so, the Reserve Bank, as the Government\u2019s debt manager, could manage the borrowing programme  by maintaining easy liquidity conditions. Surely, yields on government securities had firmed  up, but only modestly. Ev en as fiscal deficit this year (2010/11), as a percentage of GDP, is lower, the absolute amount of government borrowing in gross terms is roughly of the same or der as in last year. Indeed, measured by the metric of fresh supply of government  paper, the borrowing this year  will be higher than in last year, and this perhaps will be a more influentia l determinant of the yield trajectory. Meanwhile, the economic conditions have chan ged since last year in importa nt ways. First, inflationary pressures are stronger, thereby restraining the flexib ility for infusing liquidity through open market operations (OMO). Second, last year ba nks held significant quantities of Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS) bonds i ssued earlier for sterilizing the liquidity arising from capital flows. The Reserve Bank bought back those bonds to infuse systemic liquidity. That option is not available this year as the quantum of MSS b onds remaining is very marginal. Finally and importantly, as recovery is taking hold, priv ate credit demand is reviving. But the upward pressure on yields on government securities and th e consequent pressure on interest rates makes \u2018crowding out\u2019 a potential possibility.   26. Even setting aside crisis related developm ents, \u2018fiscal dominance\u2019 of monetary policy continues to be a concern. The long  term interest rates are influenced significantly by the yields on government securities and hence on the si ze of the government borrowing programme,  11thereby eroding to some extent the efficacy of  monetary transmission. The credibility of the Reserve Bank\u2019s inflation manageme nt, therefore, is critically dependent on the credibility of Government\u2019s fiscal consolidation.   27. Fiscal consolidation is impor tant for a number of other we ighty reasons apart from the inflation dimension. The Government has initi ated action on the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission (TFC) on the revi sed road map for fis cal responsibility. In drilling down the road map, the G overnment should also keep in view two relevant objectives. First, fiscal consolida tion should shift from excl usive reliance on increasing revenues to focus on restructuring expenditures. The c onsolidation effort should target  slashing recurring expenditures rather than one-off items. Second, it is important, even as targeting quant itative indicators, to pay equal attention to the quality of fiscal adjustment.  Improving Monetary Policy Transmission 28. The standard tool of central banks is the short term interest ra te which they use to influence interest rates across financial markets, and thereby steer the fina ncial conditions in the economy. During the crisis, central banks around the world reduced policy rates ferociously, and in many advanced economies the rates are at or near zero. However, financial markets refused to respond and remained in seizure reflecting the ne ar total collapse of monetary transmission.   29. The effectiveness of moneta ry transmission, the process by  which the central bank\u2019s policy signals influence the financial markets,  is a function of both tangible and intangible factors. It depends on the depth and efficiency of the financial markets. It also depends on the overall confidence and sentiment in the financia l system. Typically, monetary transmission in  12emerging economies tends to be slower, reflecti ng shallow financial ma rkets and inefficient information systems.   30. The monetary transmission mechanism in I ndia has been improving but is yet to fully mature. There are several factors inhibiting the transmission process.  First, India has a government sponsored small savings programme char acterized by administered  interest rates and tax concessions. Operating through a huge networ k of post offices and fi eld agents, the small savings scheme has an enormous and impressive  reach deep into the hinterland. Banks are typically circumspect about reducing deposit rates in response to the central bank\u2019s policy rate signals for fear of losing their deposit base to small savings. The government too has not adjusted the rates on small savings on a regular  basis to offset their competitive edge.    31. Second, depositors enjoy an asymmetric co ntractual relationship with banks. When interest rates are rising, depositors  have the option of withdrawi ng their deposits prematurely and redepositing at the going higher ra te. On the contrary, when depos it rates are falling, banks do not have the option of repricing deposits at th e lower rate because of the asymmetry of the contract. This structural rigidity clogs mone tary transmission. Banks are typically unable to adjust their lending rates swiftly in response to policy signals until they are able to adjust on the cost side by repricing the deposits in the next cycle. Third, and importantly, monetary transmission is also impeded because of large government borrowings and illiquid bond markets.   32. There is a stereotype view that monetary  transmission broke down during the crisis in India too like in advanced economies. This is incorrect. Monetary policy signals transmitted to the money and bond markets reasonably efficientl y. Monetary transmission in the credit market was admittedly slower but this had more to do w ith the structural rigidities explained above rather than any crisis related impediments in the financial markets.   13 33. In evaluating monetary transm ission during the crisis, it sh ould be remembered that the contagion of the crisis transmitted to India thoug h largely the confidence channel; the financial markets were affected more by a perception of scarcity than actu al scarcity. As such, market conditions improved markedly in fairly quick or der since the Reserve Bank\u2019s assurance that it will maintain \u2018abundant\u2019 liquidity inspired widespr ead confidence in the markets. It is important to recognize that in India, the cr isis transmitted from the real to the financial sector unlike in the advanced economies where the transmission was from  the financial sector to the real sector. The implication of this is that the decline in credit flow, as banks have asserted, was due more to a decline in credit demand from the private sector rather than any increased risk aversion on the part of the banks.  34. It should be recognised that the clogs in monetary transmission in India are possibly exaggerated because of the current system of loan pricing. Banks are required to declare a benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) but they en joy the freedom to lend at rates below their BPLR. Over time, sub-BPLR lending has become a rule rather than an exception. Currently about two thirds of bank  lending takes place at rates below th e BPLR. As many interest rates are indexed to the BPLR, banks have been reluctant to adju st their BPLRs in response to policy rate changes as changes erode their discretionary flex ibility in pricing loans. The BPLR system has therefore become an inadequate tool to evaluate monetary transmission.   35. Improving monetary transmission is important if the Reserve Bank\u2019s efforts at promoting growth with price stability are to be effective. The problems indicated above suggest obvious solutions. An important reform initiative post crisis has been the replacement of the BPLR system by a new base rate [BR] system which w ill come into effect on July 1, 2010. Each bank will determine its own BR reflecting all thos e cost elements which are common across  14borrowers. A bank will then charge its borrowers the base rate plus a pr emium on top of that reflecting customer specific risk. The BR will th ereby set the floor for all lending rates. Concurrently, the ceiling interest rate on e xport credit and small loans up to Rs. 200,000 has been withdrawn making deregulation of lending rates complete. The new system is expected to be transparent, fair and contestable and will he lp in improving monetary transmission to credit markets.  Conclusion 36. In the course of my comments, I ha ve spoken about five specific issues:  (i) Capital flows    (ii) Exchange rate management (iii) Inflation targetting (iv) Harmonizing monetary  and fiscal policies  (v) Improving monetary policy transmission 37. My effort has been to indi cate our priorities and clarify our policy stance on some issues thrown up by the crisis. This is by no means an exha ustive list of our challe nges or tasks. That I am sure will be a much longer listing.  38. The final thought that I want to leave with you as I finish is that th e growth drivers that powered India\u2019s high growth in the years before the crisis are all intact. The challenge for the Government and the Reserve Bank is to move on  with reforms to steer the economy to a higher growth path that is sust ainable and equitable.  ", "25 Apr 10 MP.pdf": "    Statement by Mr.  Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India (On behalf of Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, Fi nance Minister of India and Member IMFC representing the Constituency consisting of  Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Sri Lanka)  Leader of the Indian Delegation to the International Monetary and Financial Committee Washington D.C, April 24, 2010 ___________________________________________________________________  Mr. Chairman:  1.      Confounding our worst fears, the turn around in the global economy has been much faster than we had anticipated as recently as only a few months ago when we met in Istanbul. The global economy has experienced three quart ers of positive growth  following the sharp declines in the first quarter of 2009 and in  the preceding quarter. There is, however, considerable heterogeneity in the pace of the upturn in different coun tries with emerging and developing countries leading the way.   The Global Economy  2.      Although the global outlook is more reassuri ng than it was a few months ago, uncertainty about the shape and pace of global recovery persists. While macroeconomic risks have decreased, vulnerabilities re main. There is growing concern about the deterioration in the sovereign risk profile and dangers  posed to financial stability in  some countries. It is often said that every financia l crisis is followed by a sovereign debt crisis because of the public sector\u2019s support to affected  parts of the economy. Will th is time be different? Recent developments have shown the merits of a grad ualist approach to allowing external financing of fiscal deficits. The crisis  and the post-crisis experience should usher in some rethink on how and by how much debt markets be opened up for external financing.   3.      Volatile capital flows have been a central issu e during the crisis, and continue to be so now as the crisis is ebbing. Emerging Mark et Economies (EMEs) saw a sudden stop and reversal of capital flows duri ng the crisis as a consequence of global deleveraging. Now the trend has reversed once again, and many EMEs are seeing net inflows - a consequence of a global system awash with liquidit y, the assurance of low interest  rates in advanced economies over \u2018an extended period\u2019 and the promise of growth in EMEs. Capital flows can also potentially impair financial stability. The familiar question of how EMEs can maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of volatile ca pital flows has returned to haunt the policy agenda.    4.      The recent crisis has clearly been a turning point in the world view on capital controls. The crisis saw, across emerging economies, a rough correlation between the extent of openness of the capital account and the adverse imp act of the crisis. Surely, this should not be read as a denouncement of open capital account, but a powerful demonstration of the tenet that premature opening hurts more than it help s. Notably, the IMF published a policy note in 2   February 2010 that reversed its long held  orthodoxy. The note has referred to certain \u2018circumstances in which capital controls can be  a legitimate component of the policy response to surges in capital flows \u2019. Now that there is wide agreement that controls can be \u2018 desirable and effective\u2019  in managing capital flows,  the IMF and other intern ational bodies must pursue research on studying what type of controls and under what ci rcumstances so that emerging economies have useful guidelines to inform policy formulation.   The Mandate of the Fund 5.      The Fund has done a remarkable job of mana ging the crisis respons e.  Drawing on the lessons of the crisis, the Fund needs to adapt to the post-crisis scen ario.  We welcome the review of the mandate of the Fund which should help it effectively refocus on areas such as macro-financial stability and the spillover impact of policies of systemically important countries.  Such a review should lead to sign ificant improvements in the surveillance and lending tool kits of the Fund.    6.      The surveillance and lending functions of the Fund are distinct and need to be performed in a manner that best serves the in terests of the global economy.  A key lesson of the crisis is that systemic risks lie not only in less mature markets but in advanced countries as well. The clear lines of distinction between th e surveillance and lending functions have to be maintained to ensure that the Fund\u2019s more in tense surveillance focuses not only on borrowers and potential borrowers but al so on the creditor members.  Surveillance 7.      The Fund\u2019s surveillance has a preemptive role in focusing on vulnerabilities and detecting the onset of crises in contrast to  the Fund\u2019s financing function which essentially plays a crisis mitigation role.  The lessons of the crisis warrant a careful scrutiny of the manner in which the Fund conducts its surv eillance, both multilatera l and bilateral.   8.      For surveillance to be effective and for it to inspire trust and confidence, it is vital that it is even-handed, candid and unbiased.  How do we operationalize this?  A mandate that is derived only from an Executive Board decision obtai ned by a simple majority could be open to differing interpretations subsequently, th ereby sacrificing clarity for expediency.   In our view, the best way to achieve this objective is by amending the Articles of Agreement to give the Fund oversight over th e international monetary and fina ncial system and over financial sector policies within the conduct of domestic policies by members.  9.      We believe that the Fund is strategically  positioned to conduct effective multilateral surveillance by virtue of its universal membersh ip and the forum for peer review that it provides. Accordingly, we can e ngage constructively and with an open mind towards building a wider consensus on improving multilateral surveillance through innovative instruments such as spillover reports; multilateral consultations; and enhanced interaction with regional/country groups. For a reality check, there sh ould be trial runs before taking a view on their usefulness.   10.      Bilateral surveillance is at the core of the Fund\u2019s mandate and the proposals for improving multilateral surveillance should not co mpromise the pursuit of robust and even-handed bilateral surveillance . There is need for ensuring synergy between IMF's bilateral and 3   multilateral surveillance. Improvement in timeliness and increased communication is desirable, but care needs to be exercised to es chew undue proliferation of reports whereby the quality of surveillance is compromised by spreading resources thinly and widely.   11.      The issue of financial sector oversight is  indeed a crucial one. We find merit in assessing the efficacy of new approaches. Mapping global financial networks, deeper engagement with large complex financial interm ediaries (LCFIs), asset managers and central counterparties (CCPs); and clos er and more effective coopera tion with standard setting bodies, including the ongoing engagement with the Financial Stability Board (FSB) on the Early Warning Exercise (EWE) are some initiatives  in this genre. The lessons of the crisis also underscore that th e focus on important financial centres and systemically important countries should be  intensified.   12.      There is a rationale for strengthened fina ncial sector surveilla nce in assessing macro-systemic risks in view of the lessons of the cr isis. However, the modalities of operation in this role would need deeper consid eration to guard against missi on creep and to preserve the distinct roles of the IMF on the one hand and the FSB a nd the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) on the other. We have concer ns about the need and utility of a mandatory Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) at this stage. It is better to preserve the voluntary nature of FSAP with enhanced efforts to secure the widest participation by making FSAP forward looking and focused. Priority should be given to the first round of FSAP for all systemically important countries before repe ating FSAP for countries  which have already gone through a similar exercise.  13.      A key pre-requisite for effective surveillance is governance reforms that reflect changing global economic realities and ensure e quity and balance. Effective implementation will also develop a broader consensus for further reforms.   The Financing Role of the Fund 14.      The crisis affected even  economies with sound policie s and those far from its epicenter, highlighting the need to strengthen the global financial safe ty net as a matter of priority.  The Fund should play a key role in putting together such a safety net.  The global financial safety net needs to be \u201cglobal\u201d and encompass multiple partners  - individual countries, central banks, regional arrangements , International Financ ial Institutions (IFIs) including the IMF and other multilateral instit utions.  The Fund needs to catalyze such a global arrangement, while being caref ul not to over-extend itself.    15.      While flexible precautionary instruments would help crisis prevention, the crisis has also taught us that reserve accumulation by countries is a very important element of the financial safety net.  This is particularly so in countries where reserves have been built up in the context of current account defi cits to deal with i nherently volatile cap ital flows.  Such countries should be treated as pa rtners in the global safety net,  with multilateral mechanisms acting as a complement and not a substitute for reserves accumulated at the national level.    16.      The proposed evolutionary reform of the Fund\u2019s lending toolkit should receive careful consideration on merits and on th e basis of possible u tility to a sufficiently large segment of 4   the Fund\u2019s membership.  The attempt should be  to improve existing and recently created instruments and keep the net addi tion of new instruments to the minimum.  Such an approach would enhance the signaling impact  and predictability of the in struments in the eyes of both potential users and financial markets.  17.      The implications of the Mu lti-country Swap Line (MSL),  which proposes a unilateral offer of Fund assistance in the interest of systemic stability, have to be considered carefully.  The instrument holds the promise of mitigatin g stigma of borrowing from the Fund and the potential interest in such an  instrument amongst the memb ership should be assessed.  Communication issues and the mark et signals generated by an instrument of this nature could leave the Fund with enormous power over its s overeign members, which would have to be appropriately tempered.  It will be advisable to allow more time for debating the merits and demerits of this proposal be fore taking a final view.  IMF Resources 18.        The announcement of a trebling of the Fund\u2019s resources in the London Summit in April 2009 had a salutary impact on reducing uncertainty when  the crisis was still raging.  As a follow up to that announcement, we welcom e the expansion of the New Arrangements to Borrow to US $600 billion, and call on all members to  ratify the increased le vel at the earliest.  Countries which have not been tr aditional creditors, including India, have come forward with sizeable contributions to the expanded NAB.  This should signal the need for further governance changes in the Fund.  19.      We have always affirmed the importance  of maintaining the Fund as a quota based organization. This implies that the quota-based resources and borrowed resources should be in an appropriate proportion. We s upported the decision to substantially in crease the NAB on the understanding that since the need  for resources is urgent, and a quota increase is time taking, the NAB would be a temporary brid ge to an eventual quota increase.   We do not see the need for the Fund\u2019s lendable resources to be increased any further at this stage.  We support a substantial increase in the quota resources so  that the NAB can be rolled back once an increase in quotas is effected.  This will ensure that the Fund remains a quota-based organization as it should be.     Governance Reform 20.      Governance reform will be central to the legitimacy a nd effectiveness of the Fund\u2019s mandate.  We appreciate that th e Managing Director has acknowledged this in his statement.  If the clarification and refocusi ng of the mandate of the IMF is  to have legitimacy, it should follow and not precede a change in the governance structure, including quota shares reflecting the present and emerging  global economic realities measured in the most appropriate manner rather than on the basis of an improved but still flawed  formula.    21.      The size of the quota increase is closely linked to the crucial governance issue of realignment of quota shares in the Fund.  A large quota increase not only affords the opportunity for, but also requires an ambitious re alignment of quotas, to meet the expectations of the Emerging Markets and Developing Countries  (EMDCs) who form a large section of the membership. Only such a substantial shift of quo ta shares from advanced countries to EMDCs 5   so as to better reflect current  global economic realities would enhance the legitimacy of the Fund.   22.      We reiterate our call for at least a 7 per cen t shift in quota shares in favour of EMDCs as a group. The initial staff proposals fall well s hort of expectations.   We are disappointed that the ambition displayed in proposals fo r expanding the mandate of the Fund and its resources are not matched by the ambition in th e proposals for realigni ng quota shares.      23.      The improved, but still flawed quota form ula does not adequately reflect global economic realities.  The shortcomings of th e formula, including the relative weights and definitions of the variables are well known, and in April 2008 the Board of Governors of the Fund decided that the issue requi res to be revisited before th e formula is used again. The approach so far relies too much  on the existing formula, rath er than \u201cworking from it\u201d and hence cannot be seen as enhancing the legiti macy of the Fund.  Ideally, a rework of the formula is called for; with a substantial increa se in weight for PPP-GD P in order to better reflect current economic realities.    24.      To preserve credibility, the deadline of January, 2011 has to be adhered to. We are open to taking up the formula revisi on task on a parallel track with a longer time frame.  In the meantime, the quota allocation in the present round can be completed on the basis of an alternative mechanism which ope rates on a uniform and transp arent basis without complex and opaque adjustments.  This approach should remedy real unde r-representation and automatically identify dynamic EMDCs.     25.      We are committed to protecting the vote share of the poorest countries.  This is best done through an allocation of quot as rather than th rough an increase in basic votes which would require further amendments to the Ar ticles and could delay the whole process.  26.      The most crucial area of governance reform  is a significant and meaningful quota and voice reform. All other aspects of governance reform should follow and flow from this reform.  Enhanced political e ngagement of Ministers in IMF related issues is certainly welcome.  At this juncture, such engagement  is best achieved thr ough improvements in the functioning of the IMFC. We  value the IMFC as a consensus based body and believe enhancement of the legitimacy of the Fund will enhance the effectiveness of the IMFC as well.  27.      Redistributing the chairs in the Executive Board on a more equitable basis amongst the regions of the world is also a priority.  An appropriate balan ce needs to be struck between representativeness and effectiven ess. This could involve changes to the size of the Board, including a possible reduction, without affecti ng the representation of emerging market economies and developing countries. The special majority threshold of  85 per cent brings decisions closer to a consensus and we see no  compelling reason to ch ange the existing voting majorities in the Fund.  6     Developments in the Constituency  28.      I now turn to developments in my constituency.  India  29.      The Indian economy is recovering rapidly from the growth slowdown caused by the crisis. Current estimates are that real GDP ha d grown at 7.2 per cent dur ing the just completed fiscal year 2009-10, up from 6.7 per cent during 2008-09. For pol icy purposes, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has placed the baseline pr ojection of real GDP growth for 2010-11 at 8.0 per cent with an upside bias. The monetary and fi scal stimulus measures initiated in the wake of the global financial crisis played an important role, first in mitigating the adverse impact from the crisis contagion and then in en suring that the economy recovered quickly.  30.      The developments on the inflation front, however, are worrisome. Inflation, which was earlier driven entirely by supply side factor s, is now getting increasingly generalised.  Keeping in view the inflation risk, the Reserv e Bank embarked on a calibrated exit from the expansionary monetary policy.  The Union Budge t of 2010-11 has begun th e process of fiscal consolidation by programming a reduction in the re venue deficit to 4.0 per cent of GDP from 5.3 per cent, and in the fiscal deficit to 5.5 per cent from 6.7 per cent dur ing the previous year. Going forward, three major uncertainties cloud the outlook for inflation. First, the prospects of the monsoon in 2010-11 are not yet clear. Second, crude prices continue to be volatile. Third, there is evidence of demand side  pressures building up. On balan ce, keeping in view domestic demand-supply balance and the global trend in commodity prices, the baseline projection for WPI inflation for March 2011 is placed at 5.5 per cent. Against this background, the conduct of monetary policy will continue  to condition and contain percep tion of inflation in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent. This will be in line with the medium-t erm objective of 3.0 per cent inflation consistent with India\u2019s broader integr ation into the global econo my. In this context, accommodative monetary policies in the advan ced economies, coupled with better growth prospects in India, could trigger large capital  flows into the country. While the absorptive capacity of the Indian economy has been incr easing, excessive flows pose a challenge for exchange rate and monetary management.   Sri Lanka  31.      The economy of Sri Lanka demonstrated re silience, growing at 3.5 per cent in 2009 amidst challenging domestic and external conditi ons. This performance was largely due to the steady recovery in the ec onomy since the second quarter  of 2009, building up to a robust growth of 6.2 per cent in the final quarter. Coordinated and timely policy actions of the authorities were instrumental in turning around the domestic ec onomy, enabled by the end to the prolonged conflict. Enhanced investor conf idence in the economy was reflected in a sharp reversal in foreign financial fl ows, resulting in an  unprecedented surplus in the balance of payments (BOP) of US $ 2.7 billion. The level of  foreign exchange reserves rose by more than 450 per cent to a historic high level of US $ 5.1 billion by end-2009. A notable achievement was the sharp deceleration in infl ation to 4.8 per cent by end 2009 from 28.2 per 7   cent in June 2008, a result of st ringent monetary policy measur es adopted over the last two years and the significant declin e in global commodity prices. Inflation, as measured by the year-on-year change in the Colombo Consumers\u2019 Price Index (CCPI), eased to an average rate of 3.4 per cent in 2009, the lowest since 1985. Timely po licy actions successfully mitigated the contagion of the global financ ial crisis and the failure of a few entities connected to certain domestic financial instituti ons. The strong regulatory and supervisory framework and enhanced risk management systems enabled the fi nancial system to with stand the shocks from the external and domestic fronts and maintain  confidence in the financial system. In a challenging environment, financial institut ions remained profitable and reasonably well capitalised, although credit risk increased due to tight market  conditions. Despite several measures introduced during 2009, there was a si gnificant shortfall in  revenue due to the slowdown in economic activities and the contraction in impor ts. In addition, government expenditure increased due to highe r security related spending dur ing the decisive phase of the conflict and continued urgent rehabilitation, re settlement and recons truction(RRR) activities since the second half of the year, as well as in creased salaries and wages, interest payments and expenditure on continuing public investment projects. A ccordingly, the budget deficit widened to 9.8 per cent of GDP in 2009 compared to the revised target of 7.0 per cent leading to an increase in the borrowing requirement. The end to the prolonged in ternal conflict and the restoration of peace provide greater optimism fo r economic prosperity and a strong basis for long-term sustainable development,  supported by appropriate policies.  Bangladesh  32.      A broad-based upturn is taking hold in Bangladesh, drawing strength from the multi-speed global recovery and robust domestic demand that has been supported by resilient workers\u2019 remittances and the fiscal stimulus. In fact, Bangladesh has been adequately resilient to external shocks, particularly to the advers e impact of the recent world recession. Despite these unfavorable conditions, its external pos ition remains robust with sufficient foreign exchange reserves and positive current account  balances. Manufacturing returned to positive growth in the second half of 2009-10 and a risi ng trend in industrial im ports is pointing to industrial activity firming up further. There are also lead indications that the decline in merchandise exports is bottoming out, with sw elling order books in respect of textile and apparel exports which constitu te more than three-fourths of total exports. The growing geographical diversification of export market s in favour of Japan and China is offsetting sluggish demand in the traditional export market s of North America and Europe. Construction activity is buoyant, especially in urban areas, fuelled by remittances and surging real estate prices. Service sector activity has also gained  strength, especially in education, health, retailing and catering, and financ ial services. Agricultural production lost some momentum in 2009-10 after the strong growth of  4.6 percent in the preceding year. Improved terms of trade for the farm sector, timely availability of i nputs and credit should brig hten the prospects for agriculture in 2010-11, barring unforeseen weather a dversities. Overall, real GDP growth is expected to be in the range of 5.5-6.0 percent in 2009-10 with an upside bias as against 5.9 percent in the previous year, thus extending strong and stable economic growth over nearly one decade. Inflation in terms of consumer pri ces has been on an easing path, retreating to 5.1 percent in October 2009 from 6.6 percent at  the beginning of 2009-10. Reflecting the hardening of international food and non food commodity prices, however, domestic prices have been firming in recent months and may edge up to around 6.5 percent by June 2010. 8   With domestic demand conditions remaining str ong and with private sect or credit and imports picking up, monetary and liquidity conditions ha ve tightened. The inter-bank call money rate which went below one percent in  July 2009 is now above four percent. On the other hand, public sector borrowing from the banking syst em has declined, freeing up resources for growing private sector ac tivities. It is expect ed that the stance of monetary policy will continue to remain accommodative while maintain ing price stability. In respect of public finances, contingent fiscal pressures on the government are relatively benign as outstanding guarantees for state owned enterprises are low. However, public finances would be impacted by expenditure cutbacks on account of implemen tation capacity constraints, notwithstanding higher external and non-bank financing. The es timated budget deficit for 2009-10 is placed at 4.5 percent of GDP as against th e projected level of 5.0 percen t. Efficient and expeditious implementation of development programme pr ojects can create conditions for crowding in private sector investments and together with  monetary policy, can support broad- based, inclusive and environmenta lly sustainable growth.   Bhutan 33.      Bhutan\u2019s economic performance has been st rong in the recent past anchored in political stability and prudent economic policies.  The country is well on  its way to achieving it Millennium Development Goals with the 10th Five year Plan (2008- 13) outlining a wide-ranging development agenda.  The impact of the fi nancial crisis very limited and confined to the tourism sector.  Growth is expected to be close to 7 per cent throughout the medium term supported by the Punatsangchhu-I and Mangdec hhu hydropower projects. Average inflation was lower in 2009, at about 4 percent but following inflation developments in India, inflation has risen in the first quarter of 2010. Governme nt revenue and expenditure both rose strongly in 2008/09, with revenue rising to 39 percent of GDP from 33 per cent, and expenditure to 41 percent from 33 per cent.  In the external sect or, convertible currency reserves remain high, while rupee reserves have increased sharply in recent months.  In the financial sector, credit growth is still strong but slowi ng somewhat in the private sector .  The focus of the financial sector liberalisation poli cy is on increasing competition and e fficiency in the sector and three new private sector banks have been license d and external commercial borrowing was also permitted for selected private sector entities.   Concluding Observations  34.      Concerted and decisive actions by both advanced and emerging and developing countries helped the world to deal with an unprecedented financial and economic crisis. Our response has strengthened intern ational cooperation and instilled confidence that together we can secure the financial stab ility of the world and achieve sustainable economic growth. Towards this objective, a numbe r of significant and concrete  steps have been taken, an important one being the substantial strengtheni ng of the Fund, including refinements in its surveillance, the expans ion of resources and the improveme nt of lending facilities. Looking ahead, the Fund will have a pivotal role in warning about future crises, strengthening the defences of its membership against potential threats to stability, mitigating the hardships brought on by crises if and when they strike, an d in general, fostering a global environment conducive to strong and sustainable growth. This will require the Fund to reshape and redefine its role and mandate so as to adapt to the re quirements of changing times. A lot has been achieved towards a new-look Fund, but more n eeds to be done, and in particular, the 9   organisational and governance reforms that are be ing envisaged to vest it with acceptability, legitimacy and independence.  ", "29 Aug 13 MP.pdf": "Five Years of Leading the Reserve Bank Looking Ahead by Looking Back1- Duvvuri Subbarao ________________________________________________________   First of all, my sincere thanks to the Nani Palkhivala Memorial Trust, particularly Shri Y.H. Malegam, the widely respected Chairman of the Trust, for extending me the honour of delivering the Palkhivala Memorial Lecture for this year. I know many eminent thought leaders had delivered this memorial lecture in the past, a nd I attach a lot of value to adding my name to that very select list.  Nani Palkhivala 2. I did not have the privilege of meeting or in teracting with late Shri Palkhivala. He was already a preeminent public intell ectual in the country by the time I had entered the IAS in the early 1970s. But I count myself among the millions  of educated Indians who were deeply impressed by Shri Palkhivala\u2019s commitment to pr otecting India\u2019s democratic  institutions, and the intellectual vigour with which he did so. In a car eer spanning over six decades, he distinguished himself as a brilliant lawyer, a perceptive political scientist, an intelligent communicator and an erudite diplomat, leaving behind a legacy that continues to influence our public discourse in several areas.     \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a01 Tenth Nani A. Palkhivala Memorial Lecture delivered by Dr. Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India in Mumbai on August 29, 2013. Topic of My Lecture 3. I deliberated quite a bit on an appropriate topic for a lecture to honour the memory of such an eminent public intellectual.  I was also conscious of the fact  that this will be my last public lecture as the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Quite understandably, given the Palkhivala context, my t houghts started centering around the role and responsibility of a central bank in a democratic structure. Ce ntral banks make macr oeconomic policy that influences the everyday life of people; yet they are managed by unelected officials appointed by the government. Such an arrangement is deliberate , based on the logic that an apolitical central bank, operating autonomously within a statutorily  prescribed mandate and with a longer time perspective, is an effective counterpoise to a democratically elected gov ernment which typically operates with a political mandate within the time horizon of an electoral cycle.   4. An autonomous and apolitical  central bank is a delicate arrangement too, and will work only if the government respects the autonomy of  the central bank, and the central bank itself stays within its mandate, delivers on that mandate  and renders accountability for the outcomes of its policies and actions.   5. Putting the three elements of today\u2019s lect ure context together - Shri Palkhivala\u2019s exemplary commitment to preserve and promote va lues and institutions of democracy in India; the Reserve Bank\u2019s role in the democratic edifice of India; and the completion of my term as the Governor of the Reserve Bank - I determined th at the best way I can pay tribute to Shri Palkhivala is to focus on a topic that threads together these three elements. That explains my topic for today: \u2018Five Years of Leading the Reserve Bank: Looking Ahead by Looking Back\u2019.    2\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMay you live in interesting times!\u201d 6. The Chinese have an adage: \u201cMay you live in interesting times.\u201d I can hardly complain on that count. I had come into the Reserve Ba nk five years ago as the \u2018Great Recession\u2019 was setting in, and I am finishing now as the \u2018Great Ex it\u2019 is taking shape, with not a week of respite from the crisis over the five years.  7. From a central banking perspectiv e, history will mark the last five years for two distinct developments. The first is the extraordinary s how of policy force with  which central banks responded to the global financial crisis. This has generated a vi gorous debate on the short-term and long term implications of unc onventional monetary policies as also on the responsibility of central banks for the cro ss border spillover impact of their policies. The second historical marker will be the manner in which, reflecting the less ons of the crisis, the mandate, autonomy and accountability of central banks are being rede fined in several countries around the world. Notwithstanding all the tensions and anxietie s of policy management during an admittedly challenging period, I consider myself privileged to have led one of the finest central banks in the world during such an inte llectually vigorous period.  8. Against that context, I want  to divide my lecture today on \u201cFive Years of Leading the Reserve Bank: Looking Ahead by Looking Back\u201d into two segments. In the first segment, I want to look back over the last five years and give my assessment of the macroeconomic developments during this period and the Reserve Bank\u2019s response. In the second segment, I will address the major challenges for the Reserve Bank on the way forward.      3\u00a0\u00a0I.  Macroeconomic Developments Over the  Last Five Years and RBI\u2019s Response    9. For analytical purposes, macroeconomic deve lopments over the last five years can be divided into three distinct phase s: (i) The global financial crisis  and RBI\u2019s response; (ii) Exit from the crisis and RBI\u2019s struggle with growth -inflation dynamics; and (iii) The external sector strains which have accentuated over the last few months and RBI\u2019s efforts to restore stability in the currency market.   First Phase (2008/09) - Crisis Management 10. Given all the water that has flown under the bridge since then, the Lehman crisis of 2008 seems an eternity away. Yet, that was the reality that I faced within less than two weeks of taking over as Governor. My intent here is not to rehash  the events of those days, but try and put that crisis - and therefore the polic y response - in perspective.  11. In order to appreciate that perspective, just  throw your mind back to those heady days of 2008. Recall that India was on the ve rge of being christened the next miracle economy. Growth was surging along at 9 per cent. Fiscal deficit was on the mend. The rupee was appreciating and asset prices were rising. There were inflatio n pressures but the gene ral perception was that inflation was a problem of success, not of failure. Most importantly, we thought we had \u2018decoupled\u2019 - that even if advanced economie s went into a down turn, emerging market economies will not be affected because of th eir improved macroeconomic management, robust external reserves and sound banking sectors.   12. The crisis dented, if not fully  discredited, the dec oupling hypothesis. It affected virtually every country in the world, including India. So, why did India get hit? Th e reason was that by 4\u00a0\u00a02008, India was more integrated into the global  economy than we recognized. India\u2019s two way trade (merchandize exports plus imports), as a proportion to GDP, more than doubled over the past decade: from about 20 per cent in 1998/99, the year of the Asian crisis, to over 40 per cent in 2008/09, the year of the global crisis.   13. If our trade integration was deep, our financ ial integration was even deeper. A measure of financial integration is the ratio of total extern al transactions (gross current account flows plus gross capital account flows) to GDP. This rati o had more than doubled from 44 per cent in 1998/99 to 112 per cent in 2008/09, evidencing the depth of Indi a\u2019s financial integration.  14. What this meant was that as the global financial and economic conditions went into a turmoil, we were affected through trade, fina nce and confidence channels. The Reserve Bank responded to the crisis with al acrity, with policies aimed at keeping our financial markets functioning, providing adequate ru pee liquidity, and maintaining the flow of credit to the productive sectors of the economy.   Lessons in Crisis Management 15. As someone said, this crisis was too valuable  to waste. In the event, we learnt several lessons in crisis management. I will only list the important ones. First, we learnt that in a global environment of such uncertainty and unpredictability, policy action has to be swift, certain and reassuring. Also, during crisis times, it helps en ormously if governments and central banks act, and are seen to be acting, in  concert. Second, we learnt that action is important, but communication is even more important. When th e economic environment is uncertain, market players and economic agents look up to governments and central banks for both reassurance and 5\u00a0\u00a0clarity. Indeed, communication was a critical tool all central banks, including India, adopted in those heady autumn days of 2008.   16. The third lesson we learnt is that even in a multi-nation crisis, governments and central banks have to adapt their response to domestic conditions. There is typically pressure on every country to copy the crisis response  of other countries, especially  of advanced economies (AEs). For example, AEs were forced to resort to quantitative easing (QE) to loosen monetary conditions, raise inflation expectations and lower real interest rates. Was there any need for emerging market (EM) central bank s to do so? I believe there wasn\u2019t because they had sufficient conventional ammunition left. Instead, what we had to show was that we were fully prepared to use it.   17. While on the subject of crisis, I also wa nt to share with you a dilemma. Crisis management is a percentage game. We have to do what we think has the be st chance of reversing the momentum. At the same time, we have to we igh the short-term bene fits against the longer term consequences, including moral hazards. In 2008, massive infusion of liquidity was seen as the best bet. Indeed, in uncharted waters, erring on the side of caution meant providing the system with more liquidity than  considered adequate. This stra tegy was effective in the short-term, but with hindsight, we know that excess liqu idity may have reinforced inflation pressures. In the thick of the crisis, the judgement call we  had to make was about balancing the benefits from preventing a crisis against the costs of pot ential inflation down the line. Remember we were acting in real time. Analysts who are criticising us are doing so with the benefit of hindsight.     6\u00a0\u00a0Second Phase (2010/11) - Exit from the Crisis 18. India recovered from the crisis sooner than  even other emerging economies, but inflation too caught up with us sooner than elsewhere. Inflation, as m easured by the wholesale price index (WPI), which actually went  into negative territory for a brief period in mid-2009, started rising in late 2009, and had remained around  9-10 per cent for all of 2010 and much of 2011, reflecting both supply and demand pressure s. Supply pressures stemmed fr om elevated domestic food prices and rising global prices of oil and ot her commodities. Demand pressures stemmed from rising incomes and sudden release of pent up demand as recovery began. The supply shocks and demand pressures combined to tr igger a wider inflationary proc ess. We were caught in the quintessential central banking dilemma of  balancing growth and inflation. 19. In response to the inflation pressures, th e Reserve Bank reversed  its crisis driven accommodative monetary policy as early as October 2009 and started tightening. We have been criticized for our anti-inflationary stance, ironically from two opposite directions. From one side, there were critics who argued that we were too so ft on inflation, that we were late in recognizing the inflation pressures, and that even after recognizing such pre ssures, our \u2018baby step\u2019 tightening was a timid and hesitant response. Had the Re serve Bank acted quickly and more decisively, inflation could have been brought under control much sooner. From the other side of the spectrum, we were criticized for being too ha wkish, mainly on the argument that there was no need for the Reserve Bank to respond to inflation driven largely by food and supply shocks, and that we only ended up stifling growth without easing inflation pressures.   20. Let me respond to this criticism from both ends of the spectrum.  7\u00a0\u00a021. To those who say that we were behind the cu rve, my simple response is to recall the context of the years 2010 and 2011. Much of the wo rld was still in a crisis mode, the eurozone crisis was in full bloom and there was a lot of uncertainty globally. And as we learnt from the experience of the 2008 Lehman episode, we re mained vulnerable to adverse external developments. Our \u2018baby steps\u2019 were therefor e a delicate balancing act  between preserving growth on the one hand and restra ining inflation on the other.  22. With the benefit of hindsight , of course, I must admit in all honesty that  the economy would have been better served if our monetary tightening had started sooner and had been faster and stronger. Why do I say that? I say that because  we now know that we had a classic V-shaped recovery from the crisis, that grow th had not dipped in the Lehman crisis year as low as had been feared, and that growth in the subsequent two years was stronger th an earlier thought. But remember, all this is hindsight whereas we were  making policy in real ti me, operating within the universe of knowledge at that time.  Just as an aside, this epis ode highlights the importance of faster and more reliable economic data fo r effective monetary policy calibration.   23. Let me now respond to the doves who argue th at the Reserve Bank was too hawkish in its anti-inflationary stance.   24. First, I do not agree with the argument that  the Reserve Bank failed to control inflation but only ended up stifling growth. WPI inflati on has come down from double digits to around 5 per cent; core inflation has de clined to around 2 per cent. Yes, growth has moderated, but to attribute all of that moderation to tight mone tary policy would be inaccurate, unfair, and importantly, misleading as a policy lesson. India\u2019 s economic activity slowed owing to a host of supply side constraints and governance issues, cl early beyond the purview of the Reserve Bank. 8\u00a0\u00a0If the Reserve Bank\u2019s repo rate was the only f actor inhibiting growth, growth should have responded to our rate cuts of 125 bps betw een April 2012 and May 2013, CRR cut of 200 bps and open market operations (OMOs) of `1.5  trillion last year.   25. Admittedly, some growth slowdown is attribut able to monetary tightening. Note that the objective of monetary tightening is to compress aggregate demand, and so some sacrifice of growth is programmed into monetary  tightening. But this sacrifice is only in the short-term; there is no sacrifice in the medium term. Indeed, low and steady inflation is a necessary precondition for sustained growth. Any growth sacrifice in the short term w ould be more than offset by sustained medium term growth. I want to reit erate once again that th e Reserve Bank had run a tight monetary policy not because it does not  care for growth, but because it does  care for growth.  26. Critics of our monetary tightening must also note that our degrees of freedom were curtailed by the loose fiscal stance of the government during 2009-12. Had the fiscal consolidation been faster, it is possible that monetary policy calibration could have been less tight.   27. And now let me respond to the criticism that  monetary policy is an ineffective tool against supply shocks. This is an ageless and time less issue. I am not the first Governor to have to respond to this, and I know I won\u2019t be the last. My response s hould come as no surprise. In a $1500 per-capita economy - where food is a large fraction of the expend iture basket - food inflation quickly spills into wa ge inflation, and therefore into core inflation. Indeed, this transmission was institutionalized in the ru ral areas where MGNREGA wages are formally 9\u00a0\u00a0indexed to inflation. Besides, when food is su ch a dominant share of the expenditure basket, sustained food inflation is bound to i gnite inflationary expectations.   28. As it turned out, bo th these phenomena did play out - wages and inflation expectations began to rise. More generally, th is was all against a context of  consumption-led growth, large fiscal deficits, and increased implementation bottlenecks. If ever there was a potent cocktail for core inflation to rise this was it. And it did - rising from under 3 per cent at the start of 2010 to almost 8 per cent by the end of the next year. It is against this backdrop that our anti-inflationary stance in 2010 and 2011 needs to be evaluated.   Third Phase (2012/13) - Pressures  in the External Sector  29. Remember, I began my speech with the old Ch inese saying - \u201cMay you live in interesting times.\u201d So, as inflation began to moderate yiel ding space for monetary easing to support growth, we got caught up with external s ector strains over the last two years and a sharp depreciation of the rupee over the last three months. There has been dismay about the ferocity of depreciation; there has also been a growing tendency to attribute all of this to the \u2018tapering\u2019 of its ultra easy monetary policy by the US Fed.   30. Such a diagnosis, I believe, is misleading. Admittedly, the speed and timing of the rupee depreciation have been due to the markets factor ing in \u2018tapering\u2019 by the US Fed, but we will go astray both in the diagnosis and remedy, if we do not acknowledge that the root cause of the problem is domestic structural factors.   31. What are these structural factors? At its r oot, the problem is that we have been running a current account deficit (CAD) we ll above the sustainable level fo r three years in a row, and 10\u00a0\u00a0possibly for a fourth year this year.  We were  able to finance the C AD because of the easy liquidity in the global system. Had we used the breathing time that  this gave us to address the structural factors and brought the CAD down to its sustainable level,  we would have been able to withstand the \u2018taper\u2019. In  the event, we did not. We therefor e made ourselves vulnerable to sudden stop and exit of capital flows driven by global se ntiment; the eventual cost of adjustment too went up sharply.  32. But what drives the CAD so high? Basic ec onomics tells us that the CAD rises when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply. Ther e is an argument that this logic is not applicable to us in the current juncture given the sharp slow down in gr owth. But we need to recognize that the CAD can increase substantially even in a low growth environment if supply constraints impact both growth and external  trade as has been the case with us.   33. The only lasting solution to our external s ector problem is to reduce the CAD to its sustainable level and to finance the reduced CAD through stable, and to the extent possible, non-debt flows. Reducing the CAD requires structural solutions - RBI has very little policy space or instruments to deliver the needed structural  solution. They fall with in the ambit of the government. Structural adjustment will also take tim e. In the interim, we need to stabilize the market volatility, a task that falls within the domain of the Reserve Bank.   34. It is the avowed policy of the Reserve Bank not to target a level of exchange rate and we have stayed true to that policy. Our efforts over the last few years, particularly the last three months, have been to smoothen volatility as the exchange rate adjusts to its market determined level so as to make the near-term cost of ad justment less onerous for firms, households and banks. 11\u00a0\u00a0  35. There has been criticism th at the Reserve Bank\u2019s policy me asures have been confusing and betray a lack of resolve to curb exchange rate  volatility. Let me first of all reiterate that our commitment to curbing volatility in the exchange rate is total and unequivocal. I admit that we could have communicated the rationale of our measures more effectively.   36. But our actions were consiste nt. Our capital account measures  were aimed at encouraging inflows and discouraging outflows. Also, we tightened liquidity at the short end to raise the cost of short-term money so as to curb volatility.  At the same time, we wanted to inhibit the transmission of the interest rate  signal from the short end to th e long end as that would hurt flow of credit to the productive sect or of the economy. So, we inst ituted an Indian version of \u201coperation twist\u201d.   37. I must reiterate here that it is not the pol icy of the Reserve Bank to resort to capital controls or reverse the direction of capital acco unt liberalization. Notably, the measures that we took did not restrict inflows or outflows by non-residents.           12\u00a0\u00a0II. Challenges for the Reserve Bank on the Way Forward  38. Now let me turn to the second part of my lect ure. Several times over th e last five years. I have often been asked about the challenges for the Reserve Bank on the wa y forward. As I finish my term as Governor of this great institution, this  is a question that has been playing repeatedly in my mind. I am deeply conscious that this is not a seminar, so I will highlight, but only briefly, four challenges that the Reserve Bank will need to address in order to remain a premiere policy institution.  Managing Policy in a Globalizing World 39. The first challenge on my list is for the Re serve Bank to learn to manage both economic and regulatory policies in a globalizing world. The global financial crisis, the eurozone sovereign debt crisis as well as the currency market volat ility over the last few m onths have emphatically demonstrated how external developments infl uence our domestic macroeconomic situation in complex, uncertain and even capricious ways. In making our policies, we have to factor in external developments, particularly the spillove r impact of the policies of advanced economies on our macroeconomy. This will become even more  important as India\u2019s integration with the global economy increases. Surel y, globalization is a double edged sw ord. It comes with costs and benefits. The Reserve Bank needs to sharpen the analytical and intellectual rigour to make policies that exploit the advantages of globalization and mitigate its risks.  40. Over the last five years, as an instituti on, we have learnt quite a lot about managing policy in a globalizing world. Yet th e learning curve ahead is steep. My wish is that the Reserve Bank should take the lead in setting standards for how an emerging market central bank manages 13\u00a0\u00a0policies in a globalizing world. In other words, we should become the best practice that other central banks emulate.  Knowledge Institution 41. The second on my list of challenges is that  the Reserve Bank must position itself as a knowledge institution. The crisis has shown that  knowledge matters. Those central banks which are at the frontiers of domain knowledge and ar e pushing the envelope in terms of policies and actions will be better equipped to deal with the complexities of macroeconomic management in an increasingly dynamic and interconnected world.  42. There is obviously no template or manual for becoming a knowledge institution nor is there a comprehensive list of attributes. Be coming a knowledge institution is a continuous process of learning from the best practices in th e world, oftentimes reinve nting them to suit our home context, pushing the envelope, aski ng questions, being ope n minded, acting with professionalism and integrity and encouraging an instituti onal culture that  cuts through hierarchies. The Reserve Bank will also need to review its HR policies so as to build a talent endowment that can meet the challenges on the way forward.  Keep Your Ear Close to the Ground 43. When I was appointed Governor of the Re serve Bank in 2008, I went to call on the Prime Minister before I took ch arge. A man of few words as we al l know, he told me one thing that stuck in my mind: \u201cSubbarao, you are moving from  long experience in the IAS into the Reserve Bank. In the Reserve Bank, one runs the risk of losing touch with the real world. With your mind space fully taken up by issues like interest ra tes, liquidity traps and monetary policy transmission, it is easy to forget that mone tary policy is also about reducing hunger and 14\u00a0\u00a0malnutrition, putting children in school, creating jobs, building roads and bridges and increasing the productivity of our farms and firms.  Keep your ear close to the ground.\u201d   44. In the five years that I have been at the Reserve Bank, I have followed this wise counsel to the best of my ability. We have introduced a number of initiatives. The outreach programme of village visits by top executives of the Re serve Bank, village immersion programme for our younger officers, town hall shows and meetings with focus groups, conferences with frontline managers, conventions of business correspondents , to mention some of the important ones.   45. As a result of all these initi atives, the Reserve Bank is more  conscious today than before that the policies it makes have a meaning if, a nd only if, they make a positive difference to the real world. For example, one of the core concerns  of the Reserve Bank\u2019s anti-inflationary stance is that inflation hurts, but hurts the poor much mo re than the better off. But the poor are not an organized, articulate lobby. As a public po licy institution, the Reserve Bank has the responsibility to make that extra effort to listen to the silent \u2018v oice of the poor\u2019.   46. Outreach is not a discrete task; it is a continuous  process.  As I said earlier, the policies of the Reserve Bank impact the everyday lives of people. The Reserve Bank will remain a useful and relevant institution only if it is able to un derstand the hopes and as pirations of ordinary people and factor them into  its policy calculus.   Autonomy and Accountability 47. The crisis over the last five years has re opened some fundamental questions about central banks - their mandates, the limits to their au tonomy and the mechanisms through which they render accountability. These questions are playi ng out in India too. Se veral committees have 15\u00a0\u00a0suggested that the mandate of the Reserve Ba nk should be narrowed on the argument that its currently broad mandate is diluting its focus on pr ice stability - the core concern of monetary policy. The Financial Sector Legislative Re forms Commission (FSLRC)  which submitted its report to the Government in March this year has argued that the mandate of the Reserve Bank should be restricted to moneta ry policy and regulation of banks and the payment system.   48. In the context of the mandate of central ba nks, one needs to keep in mind that the global financial crisis was a powerful rebuke to central  banks for neglecting fina ncial stability in the pursuit of price stability. In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, which saw the US Fed and other central banks provide liqui dity in spades and use unconven tional tools, a consensus had emerged that financial stability needed to be ex plicit in the objectives of monetary policy. Then the euro zone debt crisis forced the ECB to bend and stretch its mandate to bail out sovereigns, in essence implying that a central bank committed to  financial stability could not ignore sovereign debt sustainability. Pu t differently, the fundame ntalist view of a central bank with a single-minded objective (price stability), and a single instrument (short-term interest rate) is being reassessed across the world.  49. The jury is still out, but a consensus is building around the view that central banks now need to balance price stability, financial stability and sovereign debt sustaina bility. How this is to be achieved is the big question.  50. Clearly there are no easy answers. But there are certain tenets th at must inform the thinking over this issue. First, the fundamental responsibility of central banks for price stability should not be compromised. Second, central banks should have a lead, but not exclusive, responsibility for financial stability. Third, th e boundaries of central bank responsibility for 16\u00a0\u00a0sovereign debt sustainability should be clearly  defined. Fourth, in the matter of ensuring financial stability, the government must normally  leave the responsibility to the regulators, assuming an activist role only in times of crisis.   51. The crisis has made a strong case for a more expanded role for central banks. Do we ignore all that, and fall back on the old understanding of what a central bank should or should not do to change the RBI\u2019s remit and scope of influenc e? That could turn out to be sub-optimal, even risky.  52. Related to all this is the question about the limits to the autonomy of the Reserve Bank and where and to what extent it should defer to  the executive. Finally, there are also questions about the accountability of the Reserve Bank for the outcomes of its policies.   53. As Governor of the Reserve Bank, I not only welcomed the debate on these issues, but even encouraged it, in the firm belief that such a de bate is in the larger public interest. At various times and in various contexts, I have responded to the issues in the debate. This is not the time and platform for extensive engagement on these i ssues. Here, I only want to  give my broad view.  54. Admittedly, the Reserve Bank has a mandate th at is wider than that of most central banks. This is an arrangement that has served  the economy well. There are synergies in the various components of the Reserve Bank\u2019s mandat e and we should not fore feit those synergies. Surely, our institutional structures must adapt to the chan ging socioeconomic context, but any such change must be brought about only  after extensive debate and discussion.   17\u00a0\u00a055. Notably, in a full length feature on the Reserve Bank in 2012, The Economist  had said that the RBI is a role model for the kind of full service central bank that is back in fashion worldwide. There is something to that.  56. It is also important that the mandate of th e Reserve Bank is written into the statute, so that it is protected from the politic al dynamics of changing governments.  57. In the opening part of my lecture today, I expl ained the rationale for an autonomous central bank. Like in most other developi ng economies, the Reserve Bank was not born autonomous; it gained its autonomy over time as  a result of the lessons of international experience and the maturity of our political executive who saw th e benefits of preserving the autonomy of the Reserve Bank. On its part, the Reserve Bank earned this autonomy by staying committed to the pursuit of larger public interest.   58. Accountability is the flip side of autonomy. The Reserv e Bank of India Act does not prescribe any formal mechanis m for accountability. Over the years, however, certain good practices have evolved. Let me br iefly illustrate. We explain the rationale of our policies, and where possible indicate expected outcomes. Th e Governor holds a regular media conference after every quarterly policy revi ew which is an open house for que stions, not just related to monetary policy, but the en tire domain of activities of the Reserve Bank.   59. The Reserve Bank also services the Finance Minister in answering parliament questions relating to its domain. Most importantly, the Gove rnor appears before the Parliament\u2019s Standing Committee on Finance whenever summoned, which happens on the average three to four times a year.  18\u00a0\u00a0 60. It has often struck me that for a public policy institution with such a powerful mandate, these mechanisms for accountability are both inadequate and unstructured. Perhaps, we should institute an arrangement whereby the Governor  goes before the Parliament Standing Committee on Finance twice a year to present a report on the Reserve Bank\u2019s policies and outcomes and answers questions from the members of the Committ ee. In my view, this w ill not only secure the accountability structure but also protect the Reserve Bank from any potential assaults on its autonomy.  61. I have dwelt a bit longer on this last chal lenge of autonomy and accountability if only because we have not debated this in the larger public domain as much as we should have. And to the Reserve Bank staff, I want to say that they must be as zealous abou t rendering accountability as they are about guarding its au tonomy.   Thank God, the Reserve Bank Exists 62. A final thought on this issue of autonomy and accountability. There has been a lot of media coverage on policy differences between  the government and th e Reserve Bank. Gerard Schroeder, the former German Chancellor, on ce said, \u201cI am often frustrated by the the Bundesbank. But thank God, it exists.\u201d I do hope Finance Minister Chidambaram will one day say, \u201cI am often frustrated by the Reserve Bank, so fr ustrated that I want to  go for a walk, even if I have to walk alone. But thank God, the Reserve Bank exists.\u201d     19\u00a0\u00a0Conclusion 63. Let me now conclude. Over the course of this lecture, I have looked back to the last five years and indicated how that period divided into three different phases of complex policy challenges. I made an assessment of the Reserv e Bank\u2019s policy response and addressed some of the criticism of that policy respons e at a broad level. Then, I looked ahead to four challenges that the Reserve Bank must address in order to remain a responsible, relevant a nd intellectually agile policy institution.   64. It has been an enormous privilege for me to  serve the Reserve Bank of India over the last five years. There were taxing times, testing tim es, anxious times. But at all times, I moved on with the confidence that there is  a great institution behind me that  will keep me in the right direction. I have been deeply impressed by the professionalism, intellectual agility and commitment of the staff and officers of the Rese rve Bank. This is an institution that has served the country with dignity and distinction and will continue to set exacting standards for professional integrity and work ethic.  Dharma 65. Nani Palkhivala said, \u201c Dharma  lives in the hearts of public men; when it dies, no constitution, no law, no amendmen t can save it.\u201d If I can extend that thought a li ttle, a nation prospers only if its public institutions are guided by dharma . The Reserve Bank of  India tops the list of India\u2019s public instit utions that are guided by Dharma  and Dharma  alone.  20\u00a0\u00a0", "18 July 13 MP.pdf": "Central Banking in Emerging Economies Emerging Challenges1- Duvvuri Subbarao __________________________________________________________________  First of all, my thanks to the Eu ropean Economics and Financial Centre for inviting me to speak at the Distinguished Speakers Seminar . It is an honour to which attach a lot of value.  Central Banks - Triumph and Tribulation 2. In the years before the crisis, central  bankers were a triumphant lot. The Great Moderation that they took cr edit for brought steady growth and low inflation in advanced economies, and ra pid growth and stable inflation in emerging market economies (EMEs). Th is benign macroeconomic environment generated a consensus around the view that  the best practice in central banking was the pursuit of a single objective (price stability) by means of a single instrument (the short-term policy interest  rate). Central bankers thought they had discovered the holy grail.  3. It turns out they had declared victor y too soon. In the event, the crisis challenged the old theology of  single target central banki ng. It also showed up the failure of central banks to correct for th e rapidly growing glob al imbalances and to keep regulation in pace with financia l innovation. Indeed, some even argue that \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a01 Speech delivered by Dr. Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the European Economics and Financial Centre, London on July 17, 2013. \u00a0the extended period of steady growth and low inflation blindsided central banks from seeing the festering financial instab ility brewing in the underbelly of the global financial system.   4. The crisis has unleashed a vigorous debate on what lessons central banks should take away from the crisis, and how they should respond to them. This debate has thrown up some important ques tions: (i) Should central banks persist with pure inflation targeting? (ii) If not, should their objective function also include real sector variables?  (iii) What is the role of central banks in preventing asset price bubbles? (iv) What  should be their responsibility  in regard to financial stability? (v) Are there synergies in the central bank being also the regulator and supervisor of banks? (vi) Will responsibi lity for financial stability compromise their autonomy? (vii) What should be  the institutional arrangement for coordination among regulators and the government?   5. That indeed is a long list of ques tions. Even as there are no definitive answers yet, several advanced econo my governments have gone ahead with redesigning their regulatory  architectures, in the pro cess redefining the mandates of their central banks.   Central Banking in EMEs 6. Are central banks in EMEs struggling with the same questions? In a broad sense yes, although both the questions and an swers are slightly different in their case. To understand why, a bit of context is necessary.  2\u00a0\u00a07. Central banks in EMEs have histor ically differed from the advanced economy central bank model in an important  way.  Their mandates have typically extended beyond price stability to supporti ng growth and to external sector management. They also have responsibi lity, in varying forms and degrees, for financial stability. In addition, many of them have a development mandate - of building institutions, deepening financial markets, modernizing financial sector infrastructures and furthering financial inclusion.   Think Global, Act Local 8. Given this difference, there was no settled view in EMEs about the optimal institutional design for their central  banks. In the years before the crisis, there was a growing view that the way forward for EME central banks lay in embracing the minimalist model of the advanced economy central bank. Now, with that minimalist model itself unravel ling, there is a rethink among EMEs on whether that is the best way forward. They are sensitive to the f act that the issues in the global debate are relevant to them; but they also realize that they have to adapt the lessons of the crisis to thei r specific macroeconomic and institutional contexts.   9. What are the challenges confronting EME central banks as they embark on this task? What are the em erging issues? This is what  I want to focus on. In particular, I will address five specific issues.   3\u00a0\u00a0 I.  Treading the Growth-Inflation Knife-Edge 10. Managing the growth-inflation balance is a particularly complex challenge in EMEs for a number of reasons. By far th e most important is the fact that in EMEs, supply shocks, especially in the f ood and fuel sectors, have historically been important drivers of inflation. How should monetary policy respond to such supply shock driven episodes of inflation?  11. Text book economics tells us that if  the supply shock is temporary, monetary policy need not react to it; on the other hand, if the supply shock is structural in nature, it can lead to gene ralized inflation - in  the first round by the higher input costs, and in the sec ond round through its impact on inflation expectations and wage bargaining. In the presence of excess demand relative to supply, the generalization of inflation could be rapid unless prevented through a forward looking anti-inflationary monetary policy stance. In short, when supply shocks impact the core component of in flation, monetary po licy should respond. Determining whether the supply shock is temporary or structur al is a frequent challenge that EME central banks confront. There is a possibility here of both type I and type II errors2, and either type of error can be costly in terms of foregone growth and loss of welfare.   12. Another important reason why managi ng the growth-infla tion balance in EMEs is a bigger challenge is because of  their relatively hi gher poverty levels. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a02 Type 1: No monetary policy response to a shock that turns out to be structural.   Type 2: Aggressive monetary policy response to a shock that turns out to be temporary.    \u00a04\u00a0\u00a0Inflation, as we all know, is a regressive tax, and it hurts the poor the most. On the other hand, the most effective way of reducing poverty is through higher growth. But higher growth is sustainable only in  an environment of price stability. Drawing the right balance between comba ting inflation and supporting growth is a complex challenge that EME central banks face.   13. Estimating the potential output is another factor  that complicates the management of the growth-inflation bala nce in EMEs. This is a difficult task everywhere, but is particularly difficult in EMEs because of large under utilized capacity coexisting with supply constraints. Consequently, it  is difficult to get an accurate estimate of the output gap and of the excess demand embodied in it, making the challenge of monetary policy calibration that much more complex.    14. I could go on with several other examples to illustrate how the growth-inflation dynamics in EMEs are structura lly and analytically different from those in advanced economies. The short point is  that EME central banks have to tread the growth-inflation knife edge with mu ch greater judgement and caution than advanced economy central banks becau se of the several known unknowns and many unknown unknowns.   II. Central Banking in a Globalizing World  Managing the Impossible Trinity   15. Let me move on to the second i ssue, about how globalization has complicated macroeconomic management  for EME central banks, as indeed demonstrated by the crisis.  5\u00a0\u00a016. As the crisis erupted, it spread fero ciously from the sub-prime US markets to financial markets around the world, demonstrating the interconnectedness of national financial systems and the spillover impact of external developments on domestic policy actions. Importantly, cen tral banks found that sentiment and confidence were remarkably co rrelated across countries.   17. In a globalizing world, external devel opments interact with the domestic economy in complex, uncertain, and even capricious ways. EME central banks have to deepen their understanding of th ese interactions. Some of the channels through which cross-border transmission occu rs are quite familiar - global prices, including commodity price movements;  synchronization of business cycles; capital flows; strong comovement of asset prices; excha nge rates of key international currencies; and interest rate  policies of central banks. Some of the transmission channels are less familiar. For example, the crisis has shown that even differences in regulatory regime s can trigger arbitrage-based action and dilute the efficacy of domestic policies.  Impossible Trinity  18. The best way to understand the challenge of monetary policy formulation in a globalizing world is through the \u2018impo ssible trinity\u2019 trilemma .  This trilemma asserts that a country cannot simultaneously maintain all three po licy goals of free capital flows, a fixed exchange rate and an independent monetary policy.   19. Given the \u2018impossible trinity\u2019 trile mma, countries have made different choices. The most common choi ce, typical across advanced economies, is to give 6\u00a0\u00a0up on a fixed exchange rate so as to run an open economy with an independent monetary policy. On the other hand, econom ies that adopt a ha rd peg give up on the independence of monetary policy. Exam ples include the currency boards set up by Hong Kong and, for a time, Argentina.   20. In contrast to advanced economies which opt for corner solutions, emerging economies here typically opted for middle solutions, giving up on some flexibility on each of the variables to maximize overall macroeconomic advantage.   India\u2019s Approach to the Impossible Trinity 21. In India too, we have opted for a middle solution on the \u2018impossible trinity\u2019 whose contours are the following: (i) We let our exchange rate be largely market determined, but intervene in the market to smooth excess volatility and/or to prevent disruptions to macroeconomic st ability; (ii) Our capital account is only partly open; while foreigners enjoy mo stly unfettered access to our equity markets, access to debt markets is restrict ed; there are limits to the quantum of funds resident corporates and individuals can take out for investment abroad, but the limits are quite liberal; and (iii) Becau se of the liberalization on the exchange rate and capital account fronts, some mone tary policy independence is forefeited. What the middle solution also implies is that we have to guard on all the three fronts with the relative emphasis across the three pillars shifting according to our macroeconomic situation.   7\u00a0\u00a0 Managing Capital Flows 22. What does the impossible trinity mean in practical terms? Let us examine this in terms of capital flows. EMEs, esp ecially those with cu rrent account deficits (CAD), need capital flows. In an ideal world, they will want capital flows just about sufficient to finance their CADs; also  they will typically prefer equity flows over debt flows and long term flows over s hort term flows. But in the real world, countries seldom find themselves in such a sweet spot; capital fl ows are either too much or too little.  23. Not only are capital flows too much or  too little, they are also volatile. They respond to both push and pull fact ors. The important push factors are the monetary stance of advanced economy central banks which determines the liquidity in the global system  and the need of investors for asset diversification. The pull factors that have influenced cap ital flows are the promise of growth in EMEs, their stable and cr edible policy environments and improved governance.   24. Over the last decade, EMEs have had to contend with bot h volatile inflows and outflows, with the problem often reve rsing direction rather abruptly. Let me sketch this out briefly to gi ve you a flavor of the challe nge that EMEs confront in managing their capital accounts.   25. The years before the crisis - the period of the Great Moderation - saw EMEs receiving large capital inflows, mu ch more than they needed. This was driven by both push and pull factors. EME currencies appreciated sharply, out of 8\u00a0\u00a0line with fundamentals, denting their competitiveness and pressuring asset prices. EMEs responded to this surge either by capital controls or intervention in the forex market or both. Experience shows that no matter how EMEs responded, no option was totally benign.   26. The capital inflow problem turned ab ruptly into an out flow problem with the outbreak of the financial crisis in  September 2008. Unnerved by the extreme uncertainty, global investor s fled from emerging economies to return to safe havens. The sudden exit put downward pre ssure on their currencies, and this time round they had to intervene in the foreign exchange market to contain the depreciation of the exchange rates.   27. The capital flow problem has become  more complex in recent years not only because of its intensity but also because of its increased volatility. The quantitative easing policies of advanced economy central banks have left the global system awash with liquidity. Much  of it has flown into EMEs, posing the familiar problem of capital surges. But because the global system has switched between risk-on and risk-off rather frequently and swiftly, EMEs have also become vulnerable to sudden stops and reversal of capital flows.   28. I have gone at length to describe the developments over the last nearly ten years to give a flavour of the problem EME central banks face on account of global uncertainties. What this demonstrates is that globalization is a powerful phenomenon. It offers immense opportunities, but also poses formidable challenges. The challenge for EMEs is to learn to maximize the benefits and 9\u00a0\u00a0minimize the costs of globalization. In pa rticular, EME central  banks have to learn to factor in global spillove rs into their domestic policies.   III.  Are EMEs Seeing a Return of Fiscal Dominance  of Monetary Policy?  29. The third issue I want to addres s in the context of emerging economy central banks is whether they are seeing a return of fiscal dominance of monetary policy.   30. This question has surfaced with vigour in the context of the euro zone crisis. The ECB claims that its bond pur chase programme is aimed at restoring liquidity and improving monetary transm ission. But many analysts believe that this is a thinly veiled attempt to shore up sovereign borrowing and that the ECB is actually acquiescing in fiscal dominan ce. Although this tension between the central bank mandate and sovereign debt sustainability is playing out in Europe, it is not new; nor is it unique to Europe.  31. The eighty odd years since the Great  Depression saw a famous rivalry between monetary and fiscal policy for dom inance. For at least three decades after the Great Depression, Keynes\u2019 intellectual  legacy ruled; gove rnments borrowed as much as they wanted and at the price they wanted withou t worrying about the implications of debt build-up, and central banks had willy-nilly acquiesced in this profligacy.   32. This trend began to reverse as a resu lt of very influen tial work during the 1960s by Milton Friedman and others ar guing that inflation is a monetary 10\u00a0\u00a0phenomenon always and everywhere, and th at output gains from debt financed public expenditure will not only be tempor ary, but also eventually inflationary. Supportive evidence for this came from the repeated episodes of stagflation during the 1970s, which saw a baffling combination of unemployment and inflation. The belief that continued fiscal  deficits are clearly not sustainable gained ground during the 1980s especially as countries integrated into the global system, and fiscally irresponsible econom ies realized that the world capital markets penalized them by demanding higher premia.   33. The trend since the mid-1990s has been for a growing number of countries to adopt fiscal rules placing limits on de ficits and/or debt, and also prohibiting primary financing of debt by the central banks. One of the broad outcomes of this effort has been that central banks f ound themselves able to conduct monetary policy free of fiscal compulsions and in a predictable fiscal framework.   34. That happy state of affairs ended in the aftermath of the crisis, and fears about fiscal dominance of m onetary policy have resurfaced.  Monetary and Fiscal  Policies in India 35. As in many economies, in India too, monetary policy was dominated by fiscal considerations during the 1970s and the 1980s. Large and growing fiscal deficits ended up being financed by the Reserve Bank which ultimately resulted in inflation. Following the global trend, we t oo put in place a fiscal responsibility legislation - the Fiscal Responsibilit y and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003 - with ceilings on deficit and debt ra tios and provisions prohibiting primary 11\u00a0\u00a0financing of government debt by the central bank. The Government\u2019s commitment to the FRBM mandate during 2003-08 afforded the Reserve Bank the necessary space to implement monetary policy aimed at low and stable inflation.    36. Like elsewhere in the world, both monetary and fiscal policies were eased in India too in response to the crisis. In  particular, this meant interrupting the fiscal consolidation process enjoined by the FRBM Act. However, even as the crisis started unwinding and inflati on rose sharply to  double-digits, the government persisted with an e xpansionary fiscal stance.   37. By far the biggest concern stemming from the large fiscal deficit, especially from the Reserve Bank\u2019s pers pective, is that it adds to aggregate demand and thereby to inflation pressures.  By crowding out the private sector, the fiscal deficit could also inhibit, if not impair, monetary policy transmission to the private sector. Credible fiscal conso lidation is, therefor e, a necessary pre-condition for stabilizing inflation and securing non-inflationary growth.   38. Over the last one year, the Governme nt embraced fiscal consolidation with commendable resolve. The fiscal deficit for the last fiscal year  (2012/13), at 4.9 per cent of GDP, was better than earlier projected and it clearly enhanced the credibility of the Government\u2019s current ye ar (2013/14) fiscal deficit target of 4.8 per cent of GDP.   39. Economies will be best served if gove rnments ensure that their central banks are able to conduct monetary po licy independently and free of fiscal 12\u00a0\u00a0compulsions. This will require, among othe r things, responsible and credible  fiscal consolidation.   IV.  The Role of Central Banks in Sa feguarding Financial Stability 40. Let me now move to the next issue - financial stability. Indeed, some of the most forceful lessons of the crisis are in this area of financial stability.   41. Note that the crisis erupted during a period of extraordinary price stability and macroeconomic stability. What this told us is that price stability and macroeconomic stability do not guarantee fi nancial stability. We also learnt that no country is an island. Although the cris is originated in advanced economies, emerging economies too were affected, i ndeed by much more than they had thought possible. The contagion brought home a simple message. In a rapidly globalizing world, national and internati onal financial stability are interlinked. They are really two sides of the same coin.  42. Another important lesson we learnt is  that financial markets are not self correcting. Indeed in the pre-crisis years, a consensus was building around the view that modern risk management has increased the resilience of the financial sector, and that any excess would self co rrect in good time. The crisis proved that to be wrong. As we unlearnt that, we also learnt some new lessons - that it is difficult to detect signs of pressure building up in the system in real time, that the financial sector can contain pressure for a longer time than we think possible, and as a consequence, when the inevitable  implosion takes place, it can be quite disastrous, or even catastrophic. We learnt that it is difficult to predict the precise 13\u00a0\u00a0nature of the implosion. For example, in the pre-crisis years, even the few who sensed stress building up in the system, thought there would be a currency crisis; in the event the implosion took the fo rm of a financial sector crisis.  43. There were other lessons too. That  a collection of rational financial institutions does not necessar ily make a rational financia l sector. In other words, rational behaviour at the i ndividual institutional level does not aggregate to collective rationality because of the fallacy of compos ition. Financial institutions are notoriously prone to herd behaviour. They have a strong collective tendency to over expose themselves to the same t ype of risk during an upturn, and become overly risk averse during a downturn which can lead the whole system on a downward spiral of risk aversion, market seizure and instability.   44. These lessons from the crisis have triggered a vigorous debate on whether financial stability should be made an e xplicit mandate of central banks. There are powerful arguments for why central banks s hould be at the centre of safeguarding financial stability. Let me list a few important ones.  (i) Generally, monetary policy and fi nancial stability are mutually supportive. This inter-dependency between the two dimensions suggests that the centr al bank, with inherent responsibility for monetary policy, should also be entrusted the responsibility for financial stability so that it can take a holistic view of policy options by factoring in costs and benefits in both dimensions.   (ii) That the central bank should have the responsibility for monetary policy is unquestioned. Because banks are the conduits through which monetary policy decisions are transmitted to the real 14\u00a0\u00a0economy, it is synergistic to entrust the responsibility for microprudential supervision of banks  also to the central bank. And if the central bank is the micropr udential supervisor, there is a strong case for it to have responsibility for regulation of systemic risk at the macro level.   (iii) By far the strongest argument in favour of entrusting the financial stability responsibility to the central bank is that it is unquestionably the lender of last resort (LoLR) for the financial system. A central bank can disc harge its LoLR function more efficiently if its mandate ex tends beyond merely monitoring financial institutions to taking preventive action. This becomes possible if the central bank is also in charge of financial stability.  45. On the issue of financia l stability, even as the le ssons of the crisis are clear, the policy responses to those lessons are not yet clear. There are some common trends, but there ar e also variations across countries on the precise manner in which they are redesigning their regulatory architectures, the additional responsibilities they are assigning to their central banks and the coordination bodies that they are setting up.   46. Are the concerns of EMEs in regard  to financial stability any different from those of advanced economies? Adm ittedly, financial instability is costly everywhere, including in EMEs. Indeed, financial stability is a necessary pre-condition for securing growth. Nevertheless,  the cost-benefit calculus for EMEs of tighter regulation in orde r to safeguard financial stab ility can be quite different from that of advanced economies. This is because EMEs are in a higher growth phase with higher credit elasticity of GD P than advanced economies. Increase in 15\u00a0\u00a0the cost of credit on account of tighter re gulation can inhibit their pace of growth. EMEs therefore need to strike the right balance between preventing financial instability and supporting gr owth. Experience shows that  managing this challenge is more a question of good judgeme nt than analytical skill.    V. Communication as a Cent ral Bank Policy Tool   Opportunities and Risks   47. Hours after the September 2001 terrorist  attacks, the US Federal Reserve put out a two sentence statement: \u201cThe  Federal Reserve System is open and operating. The discount window is open to meet liquidity needs.\u201d   48. Those two seemingly banal sentences had a remarkable calming effect on the US, and by extension, on the global financial markets. The \u2018announcement effect\u2019 was simply stunning.   49. Again Mario Draghi\u2019s famous word s that the ECB will do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro prevented, more  than anything else, what many thought was an imminent collapse of the euro.  50. Both the above are emphatic examples  of the potency of central bank communication. Given this power, one w ould have thought that central banks would have more actively resorted to co mmunication as a vehicle to further their policy objectives. On the cont rary, they used to be quite  reticent, believing that their policies must speak for themselves, and that any overt attempt to communicate could be mislead ing or distortionary.   16\u00a0\u00a051. Over the last two decades, however, th is overly rigid atti tude has gradually yielded to open and transparent communi cation as central banks have come to realize its positive impact. This shift in central bank theology from deliberate obscurity to greater transparency actually reflects a shift in the theory of monetary policy. Up until the early 1990s, monetary  policy was strongly influenced by Nobel Laureate Robert Lucas\u2019 argument that monetary policy affected real variables, like growth, only if the policy changes were unanticipated. This encouraged obscurity over openness and clarity. However, lost in the message was that monetary policy always affected  nominal variables like inflation even if fully anticipated. In the 1980s, two economis ts, also Nobel winners, Finn Kydland and Ed Prescott, argued that fully transparent rules rather than discretionary policy changes were more efficient and credible. This was the beginning of the push towards rules over di scretion and greater central bank transparency.   52. The most eloquent illust ration of this shift towa rds transparency is the change in the communication strategy of the US Fed. Hard as it might be to imagine from today\u2019s perspective, pr ior to 1994, the US Fed was not even announcing the target Fed Funds Rate; the ma rket was expected to infer the rate from the timing, sequencing and magnitude  of its open market operations. In sharp contrast, today the Fed not only a nnounces the rate but also gives a clear indication of future policy trajectory. Indeed, it is standard practice for central banks these days to indicate the policy rates, the rationale behind the policy action, the expected outcome s, and oftentimes forward guidance on future policy actions.  17\u00a0\u00a0 53. Sometimes, instead of being a vehicle for policy, communication can be the policy itself. This issue came into sh arp focus in the debate surrounding the quantitative easing (QE) policies of the US Federal Reserve. Against the QE policies, there is an influential view that  after the policy interest rate has been brought to the zero lower bound, nothing else  needs to be done except for the central bank to say that it will keep intere st rates low in the fu ture too. It is argued that this communication, just by itself , would encourage people to borrow more and spend, bailing the economy out of recession.   54. But this idea of topping up monetary easing with communication may not always work. People may not believe that the central bank will keep its promise of low interest rates. Even if they believe the central bank, they may not still borrow since what they may be trying to do is to get out of debt rather than get into further debt as is the case today.  55. So, how do central banks improve their credibility? By tying their promise of low interest rates to specific quantitativ e real sector variables? The US Federal Reserve has recently led the way in this direction by saying that it will keep interest rates low as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 per cent, and in the process, is willing to tolerate inflation slightly above its long-run target. Another way of reinforcing this promise of low interest rates is the idea of shifting from targeting inflation to  targeting nominal GDP.   56. Is communication an equally potent policy tool for EME central banks? How effectively are they using communica tion as a policy tool ?  Although I have 18\u00a0\u00a0not made an exhaustive study, it would be fa irly accurate to say that they too are learning to use communication constructiv ely, both as a vehicle for policy and sometimes as the policy itself. Let me give  an illustration from  the crisis period.  57. In the pre crisis years, it was intellectually fashionable to subscribe to the \u2018decoupling\u2019 hypothesis which held that even  if advanced economies went into a downturn, EMEs would not be affected because of their improved policy framework, robust external re serves and resilient banking  systems. Yet the crisis affected virtually all EMEs, denting the credibility of the decoupling hypothesis. EME central banks found that transparently communicating why and how they were affected by the crisis, notwithsta nding the decoupling hypothesis, actually helped assuage concerns and revive market confidence.   58. In the post-crisis period, the major way in which EME central banks have used communication is in giving forward guidance on monetary policy.  59. In the Reserve Bank too, we have started the practice of giving forward guidance on monetary policy. Because of its potential impact, we pay much more attention to the language and nuancing of the \u2018forward guidance\u2019 paragraphs than other parts of the statement. Our experien ce in this regard has been quite positive. Nevertheless, we face some challenges. Let me give you a flavor of that.   60. Forward guidance is always conditional. The dilemma then is how precisely the conditionality is to be co mmunicated, and how to ensure that the market does not ignore the conditionality  and interpret the guidance as an 19\u00a0\u00a0irrevocable commitment. Conversely, how does the central bank ensure that it does not become hostage to its guidance?  61. Also, the more uncertain the situati on, the greater the need for guidance. But also, the more uncertain the situation, the more difficult it is to give definitive guidance. For example, when the forward outlook is uncertain, we  are not able to precisely define the conditions under whic h the guidance holds and the conditions under which we may have to deviate from it. When we are not forthcoming on specifying the conditions, the market starts speculating on them, thereby raising the \u2018noise\u2019 to message ratio.   62. Despite these challenges, in the Reserve Bank, our experience with greater openness has been quite positive. We found that effective communication can be a powerful tool provided the central bank has credibility.  63. As their financial sectors get deeper  and more sophisticated, EME central banks can usefully leverage on co mmunication to enhance their policy effectiveness.  To do so however, they ha ve to improve their policy credibility as well as capacity levels.   Conclusion 64. Central banks and central bankers ha ve been at the heart of the global financial crisis. They have been blamed for policies and actions  that got the world into the crisis; they have also been prai sed for leading from the front in getting the world out of the crisis. I believe this is fair critique - central  banks have been a part of the problem and a part of the solution.  20\u00a0\u00a0 65. As we emerge out of the crisis, cent ral banks have their task cut out for them: to distil the lessons of the crisis , translate them into concrete reform measures and get cracking on implementing them.  I believe th is involves central banks changing in important ways both in terms of what they do and how they do it.   66. The challenge of post-crisis transformation is not only different but also sharper for EME central banks because of their different macroeconomic and institutional contexts. EME central banks need also to learn to manage policy making in a globalizing environment. They need to learn from the best in the world, but adapt that learning to the demands and context of their economies. They need to be constantly pushing the envelope, be at the frontiers of domain knowledge, oftentimes reinvent it, but all the time remain  sensitive to their core concerns. 21\u00a0\u00a0", "24 Jan 20 MP.pdf": "1  Seven Ages of India\u2019s Monetary Policy   Address by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor,  Reserve Bank of India at the St. Stephen's College, University of Delhi    on January 24 , 2020   I am delighted to be back in my  alma mater.   Being here, brings back a surge of memories. Today, I wish to dwell upon a few aspects of central banking in the Indian context  and RBI\u2019s role in the current situation.  I shall specifically focus on the evolution of monetary  policy regimes in India and if I am to use the poetic license  of Shakespeare, may I call it the seven ages of India\u2019 s monetary policy?   2.   The history of central banking goes back to the seventeenth century when the first institution, \u2018the Riksbank\u2019, recognised as a central bank was set up in Sweden in 1668. Set up as a joint stock bank, it was chartered to lend funds to the government and to act as a clearing house for commerce. Later on, the Riksbank abandoned commercial lending and was granted a monopoly for issuing banknotes in 1897.  Subsequently, several countries set up institutions that functioned as central banks. These early central banks  like the Bank of England and Banque de France, though set up with private capital , helped sovereigns finance their debt and were engaged in banking activities. Since then, the role of central banks across countries has constantly evolved in line with the changing needs of their economies and evolving financial structure. Today, the functions of  modern central banks are vastly different from what was expected from their early counterparts.   2  3. Let me briefly outline how the profile of the Reserve Bank has been intrinsically interwoven with the economic and financial developments in our country since independence.   4. The Reserve Bank was set up under the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 with the original Preamble that describes the broad mandate of the Reserve Bank as follows:  \u201cit is expedient to constitute a Reserve Bank for India to regulate the issue of Bank notes and keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally, to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage\u201d.    5. Later, t he Reserve Bank of India was nationalised in 1949. While  the Reserve Bank continues to perform its traditional functions such as currency management, bankers\u2019 bank and banker to the Government, its function of conducting monetary policy has undergone a sea change in various respects from time to time .   6. As w e know, policy change is generally guided by two major forces: first, the objectives that may seem appropriate earlier may lose relevance with changing behaviou ral relationships over time. For instance, when we found that the relationship of money with nom inal income was not very predictable as in the past, we adopted multiple indicators approach in 1998. Second, the state of knowledge,  updated with new theories and evidences,  requires to be applied in pursuit of better policy outcomes. This is precisely what shaped the conduct of monetary policy in India over time.  3  Evolution of monetary policy in line with the changing character of the economy   1935 to 1949: Initial Phase  7. It is interesting to note that the Reserve Bank came into being in the backdrop of the great depression facing the world economy. Given the unsettled international monetary systems, the Preamble to the RBI Act, 1934 provided the edifice for the evolution of monetary policy framework. Until independence, the focus was on maintaining the sterling parity by regulating liquidity through open market operations (OMOs), with additional monetary tools of bank rate and cash reserve ratio (CRR). In other words, exchange rate was the nominal anchor for monetary policy.  In view of the agrarian nature of the economy, inflation often emerged as a concern due to frequent supply side shocks. While the price control measures and rationing of essential commodities was undertaken by the Government, the Reserve Bank also used selective credit control and moral suasion to restrain banks from extending credit for speculative purposes.   1949 to 1969: Monetary Policy in sync with the F ive-Year Plans  8. India\u2019s independence in 1947 was a turning point in the economic history of the country. What follow ed was a policy of planned economic development. These two decades were characterised not only by a predominant role of the state but also by a marked shift  in the conduct of monetary policy. The broad objective was to ensure a socialistic pattern of society through economic growth with a focus on self -reliance. This 4  was intended to be achieved by building up of indigenous capacity, encouraging small as well as large -scale industries, reducing income inequalities, ensuring balanced regional development, and preventing concentration of economic power. Accordingly, the government also assumed entrepreneurial role to develop the industrial sector by establishing public sector undertakings.   9. As planned expenditure was accorded pivotal role in the process of development, there was emphasis on credit allocation to productive sectors. The role of monetary policy, therefore,  during this phase of planned economic development revolved around the requirements of five-year plans. Even if there was no formal framework, monetary policy was relied upon for administering the supply of and demand for credit in the economy. The policy instruments used in regulating the credit availability were bank rate, reserve requirements and open market operations (OMOs ). With the enactment of the Banking Regulation Act in 1949, statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) requirement prescribed for banks emerged as a secured source for government borrowings and also served as an additional instrument of monetary and liquidity management. Inflation remained moderate in the post -independence period but emerged as a concern during 1964- 68.  1969 to 1985: Credit Pla nning   10. Nationalisation of major banks in 1969 marked another phase in the evolution of monetary policy. The main objective of nationalisation of banks was to ensure credit availability to a wider range of people and 5  activities. As banks got power to expand credit , the Reserve Bank faced the challenge of maintaining a balance between financing economic growth and ensuring price stability in the wake of the sharp rise in money supply emanating from credit expansion. Besides, Indo -Pak war in 1971, drought in 1973, gl obal oil price shocks in 1973 and 1979, and collapse of the Bretton -woods system in 1973 also had inflationary consequences. Therefore, concerns of high inflation caused by deficit financing during 1960s gathered momentum during the 1970s. Incidentally, the high inflation in the domestic economy coincided with stagflation \u2013 high inflation and slow growth \u2013 in advanced economies. In such a milieu, traditional monetary policy instruments, viz. , the Bank Rate and OMOs were found inadequate to address the impli cations of money supply for price stability. As banks were flushed with deposits under the impact of deficit financing, they did not need to approach RBI for funds. This undermined the efficacy of Bank Rate as a monetary policy instrument. Similarly, due t o underdeveloped government securities market, OMOs had limited scope to be used as monetary policy instrument. During this phase, the average growth rate hovered around 4.0 per cent, while wholesale price index (WPI) based inflation was around 8.8  per cent.   1985 to 1998 : Monetary Targeting   11. In the 1980s, fiscal dominance accentuated as reflected in automatic moneti sation of budget deficit through ad hoc treasury bills and progressive increase in SLR by 1985. Concomitantly, inflationary impact of deficit financing warranted tightening of monetary policy \u2013  both the CRR and Bank Rate were raised significantly. The experience of monetary policy in dealing with the objectiv es of containing inflation and 6  promoting growth eventually led to adoption of  monetary targeting as a formal monetary policy framework in 1985 on the recommendations of the Chakravarty Committee. In this framework, with the objective of controlling inflati on through limiting monetary expansion, reserve money was used as operating target and broad money as intermediate target.  The targeted growth in money supply was based on expected real GDP growth and a tolerable level of inflation. This approach was flexi ble as it allowed for feedback effects. CRR was used as the primary instrument for monetary control. Nonetheless, due to continued fiscal dominance, both SLR and CRR  reached their peak levels by 1990.    12. The worsening of fiscal situation in late 1980s was manifested in deterioration of external balance position and collapse in domestic growth in 1991- 92, in the backdrop of  adverse global shocks \u2013 the gulf war and disintegration of the Soviet Union. The resultant balance of payments crisis triggered large scale structural reforms, financial sector liberalization and opening up of the economy to achieve sustainable growth with price stability.  Concurrently, there was a shift from fixed exchange rate regime to a market determined exchange rate system in 1993. In the wake of  trade and financial sector reforms and the consequent rise in  foreign capital flows and financial innovations, the  assumption of stability in money demand function as well as efficacy of broad money as intermediate target  came under question.  At the same time, there was a notable shift towards market -based financing for both the government and the private sector. In fact, autom atic moneti sation through ad hoc treasury bills was abolished in 1997 and replaced with a system of ways and means advances (WMAs).  During this period, 7  average domestic growth rate was 5.6 per cent  and average WPI-based  inflation  was 8.1 per cent.   1998 to 2015: Multiple Indicators Approach  13. As liberalisation of the economy since the early 1990s and financial innovations began to undermine  the efficacy of the prevalent monetary targeting framework, a need was felt to review the monetary policy framework and recast its operating procedures. As a result, the Reserve Bank of India adopted multiple indicators approach in April 1998.  Under this approach, besides monetary aggregates, a host of forward looking indicators such as credit, output, inflation, trade, capital flows, exchange rate, returns in different markets and fiscal performance constituted the basis of information set used for monetary policy formulation. The enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act in 2003, by introducing fiscal discipline, provided flexibility to monetary policy.  Increased  market orientation of the domestic economy and deregulation of interest rates introduce d since the early 1990s also enabled a shift from direct to indirect  instruments of monetary policy. There was, therefore, greater emphasis on rate channels relative to quantity instruments for monetary policy formulation.  Accordingly, short -term interest rates became instruments to signal monetary policy  stance of RBI .   14. In order to stabilise short -term interest rates, the Reserve Bank  placed greater emphasis on the integration of money market with other market segments. It modulated  market liquidity to steer monetary conditions to the desired trajectory by using a mix of policy instr uments. 8  Some of these instruments including changes in reserve requirements,  standing facilities and OMOs were meant to affect the quantum of marginal liquidity, while changes in policy rates, such as the Bank Rate and reverse repo/repo rates  were the inst ruments for changing the price of liquidity.   15. An assessment  of macroeconomic outcomes suggest s that the multiple indicator approach served fairly well from 1998- 99 to 2008- 09. During this period, average domestic growth rate  improved to 6.4 per cent and WPI based inflation moderated to  5.4 per cent .   2013- 2016: Preconditions Set for Inflation Targeting  16. In the post -global financial crisis period  (i.e., post- 2008), however, the credibility of this framework came into question as persistently high inflation and weakening growth began to co -exist. In the face of double-digit inflation of 2012- 13, the US Fed\u2019s taper talk in May/June 2013 posed significant challenges to domestic monetary policy for maintaining the delicate balance between sustaining growth, containing inflation and securing financial stability.  The extant multiple indicators  approach  was criticised on the ground that a large set of indicators do  not provide  a clearly defined nom inal anchor for monetary policy.  An Expert Committee was set up by RBI to revise and strengthen the monetary policy framework and suggest ways to make it more transparent and predictable.  In its Report of 2014, t he Committee reviewed the  multiple indicators  approach and recommended that inflation should be the nominal anchor for the monetary policy framework in India.  Against this backdrop, the Reserve Bank imposed on itself a glide path for bringing 9  down inflation in a sequential manner \u2013  from its peak of 11.5 per cent in November 2013 to 8 per cent by January 2015; 6 per cent by January 2016 and 5 per cent by Q4 of 2016 -17.  2016 onwards: Flexible Inflation Targeting  17. Amid this, a Monetary Policy Framework Agreement (MPFA) was signed between the Government of India and the Reserve Bank on February 20, 2015. Subsequently,  flexible inflation targeting (FIT) was formally adopted with the amendment of the RBI Act in May 2016.  The role of the Reserve Bank in the area of monetary policy has been restated in the amended Act as follows:    \u201cthe primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth\u201d.   18. Empowered by this mandate, the RBI adopted a flexible inflation targeting (FIT) framework under which primacy is accorded to the objective of price stability, defined numerically by a target of 4 per cent for consumer price headline inflation with a tolerance band of +/ - 2 per cent around it, while simultaneously focusing on growth when inflation is under control. The relative emphasis on inflation and growth depends on  the macroeconomic scenario, inflation and growth outlook, and signals emerging from incoming data.   Since then RBI has been conducting monetary policy in a forward- looking manner and effectively communicating its decisions to maintain inflation around its target and thereby to support growth. At the same time, RBI is also fine- tuning its operating procedures of monetary policy for effective policy transmission across the financial markets and thereby onto the real economy. As an 10  outcome, inflation has fall en successively and has averaged below 4 per cent since 2017 -18, notwithstanding recent up -tick in inflation driven by food prices, especially the sharp increase  in vegetable prices reflecting the adverse impact of unseasonal rains and cyclone.   Evolution  of monetary policy in line with the changing Theoretical Developments and International Best Practices   19. The monetary policy framework in India has also been guided by developments in theory and international best practices. For instance, the collapse of the Bretton -Woods system of fixed exchange rates and high inflation in many advanced economies during the 1970s provided the necessary background to the choice of money supply as a nominal anchor. Since the late 1980s, however, experience of many advanced countries with monetary targeting framework was not satisfactory inter alia due to growing disconnect between monetary aggregates and goal variables such as inflation. A similar instability in money demand function was also evidenced in the Indian context in the 1990s which led to a shift from monetary targeting to multiple indicators approach in 1998.   20. Since early 1990s, beginning with New Zealand in 1990, many advanced and emerging market economies (EMEs) have switched to inflation targeting as the preferred policy framework. India, however, formally adopted the framework in 2016 which has helped us in terms of learning from the experiences of a diverse set of countries over a long period of time. In fact, the post -global financial crisis experience questioned the relevance of narrow focus on price stability as the sole 11  objective of monetary policy, which called for adoption of a flexible approach to inflation targeting to achieve macro -financial stability. In this milieu, financial stability has em erged as another key consideration for monetary policy, though jury is still out as to whether it should be added as an explicit objective. It is interesting to note that the central banking function as the lender of last resort (LOLR) has remained intact,  notwithstanding the developments and refinements in the policy frameworks across countries, including India.           Evolution of monetary policy in line with the financial market developments   21. Financial markets play a critical role in effective transmission of monetary policy impulses to the rest of the economy.  Monetary policy transmission involves two stages. In the first stage, monetary policy changes are transmitted through the money market to other markets, i.e., the bond market and the bank loan market. The second stage involves the propagation of monetary policy impulses from the financial market  to the real economy -  by influencing spending decisions of individuals and firms. Within the financial system, m oney market is central to monetary  operations conducted by the central bank.   22.  In the case of India, money market prior to the 1980s was characterised by paucity of instruments and lack of  depth . Owing to limited participation, money market liquidity was highly skewed, characterised by a few dominant lenders and a large number of chronic borrowers. In the presence of ad hoc Treasury Bills with fixed interest 12  rate under the system of automatic monetisation, Treasury Bills could not emerge as a short -term money market instrument. Administered interest rates and captive investor base in government securities market further impeded open market operations as an effective instrument of monetary control.  The prevalence of interest rate regulations  along with restrictions on participat ion prohibited the integration of different market segments which is a prerequisite for effective monetary policy transmission.  In this environment, monetary policy initially relied mainly on credit planning and selective credit controls and eventually on monetary targeting through quantitative instruments.   23. Financial markets reform s since the early 1990s,  therefore, focused on dismantling various price and non- price controls in the financial system to facilitate integration of financial markets. Reform measures encompassed remov ing structural bottlenecks, introducing  new players/instruments,  ensuring free pricing of financial assets, relaxing quantitative restrictions, strengthening institutions, improving  trading, clearing and settlement practices, encouraging good market practices and promoting greater transparency. These reforms gradually facilitated the price discovery in fin ancial markets and interest rate emerged as a signaling mechanism. This paved way for introduction of the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) in 2000- 01 as a tool for both liquidity management and also a signalling device for interest rates in the overnight money market.  Amid greater integration of domestic financial markets with global markets, subsequently, the RBI also began to recognise the impact of global developments on domestic monetary policy. The developments in financial markets enabled the Reserve Bank 13  to use market -based instruments of monetary policy and utilise the forward- looking  information provided by financial markets in the conduct of monetary policy under the multiple indicators approach.     24. Although various segments of financial markets had acquired depth and maturity over time, a key challenge has been on fuller and faster transmission of policy rate changes not only to money market segments but also to the broader credit markets. In order to address these challenges, the Reserve Bank has been trying different models . At the same time, the liquidity management framework was also fine -tuned since April 2016 with the objective of maintaining the operating target close to the policy rate. Under this framework, the Reserve Bank assured the market to meet its durable liquidity requirements while fine- tuning its operations to make short -term liquidity conditions consistent with the stated policy stance. This was achieved through a variet y of instruments including fixed and variabl e rate repo/reverse repo of various maturities , the marginal standing facility (MSF) and outright open market operations \u2013 complemented at times by the cash management bills and foreign exchange swaps.   Challenges in the Current Context   25. One of the major challenges for central banks is the assessment of the current economic situation. As we all know, the precise estimation of key parameters such as potential output and output gaps on a real time basis is a challenging task, although they are crucial for the conduct of monetary policy. In recent times, shifting trend growth in several 14  economies,  global spillover effects and disconnect between the financial cycles and business cycles in the face of supply shocks broadly explain why monetary policy aroun d the worl d is in a state of flux. Nonetheless, a view has to be taken on the true nature of the slack in demand and supply- side shocks to inflation for timely use of counter cyclical policies.   26. We, in the Reserve Bank, therefore,  constantly update our assessment of the economy based on incoming data and survey based forward looking information juxtaposed with model -based estimates for policy formulation. This approach helped the Reserve Bank to use the policy space opened up by the expected moderation in inflation and act early, recognizing the imminent slowdown before it was  confirmed by data subsequently. Monetary policy, however, has its own limits. Structural reforms and fiscal measures may have to be continued and further activated to provide a durable push to demand and boost growth. In my previous talks elsewhere,  I have highlighted certain potential growth drivers  which , through backward and forward linkages,  could give significant push to growth. Some of these areas include prioritising food processing industries, tourism , e-commerce,  start-ups and efforts to become a part of the global value chain. The Government is also focusing on infrastructure spending which will augment growth potential of the economy. States should also play an important role by enhancing capital expenditure which has high multiplier effect.   Concluding Remarks  27.  Monetary policy frameworks in India has thus evolved in line with the developments in theory and country practices, the changing nature 15  of the economy and developments in financial markets. Within the broad objectives, however, the relative emphasis on inflation, growth and financial stability has varied across monetary policy regimes. Although global experience with financial stability as an added policy objective is still unsettled, the Reserve Bank has always been giving due importance to financial stability since the enactment of the Preamble to the RBI Act. The regulation and supervision of banks and non -bank financial intermediaries has rested with the Reserve Bank and has kept pace with the pres cribed global norms over time. More recently, the focus of financial stability has not only confined to regulation and supervision but also extending the reach of formal financial system to the unbanked and unserved population.   28. Apart from financial i nclusion, there is also a focus on promoting secured,  seamless and real -time payments and settlements. This  renewed  focus on financial inclusion and secured payments and settlements are not only aimed at promoting the confidence of general public in the domestic financial system but also improving the credibility of monetary policy for price stability, inclusive growth and financial stability.   **********   ", "3 Jan 13 MP.pdf": "Fifteenth C.

F i n a l l y , a n dimportantly, a warm welcome to all our invitees to this prestigious lecture.C.D. Deshmukh2. Sir Chintaman D. Deshmukh has a special place in the history of theReserve Bank. He was the first Indian Governor of the Reserve Bank, and servedthe institution with great distinction and dignity from August 1943 to June 1949.He presided over the transformation of the Reserve Bank from a privateshareholders' bank to a nationalised institution and was the intellectual force behindthe enactment of a comprehensive legislation for the regulation of bankingcompanies which has stood the test of time. Governor Deshmukh participated2actively in the establishment of the Bretton Woods Institutions in 1945 and playeda critical role in managing India\u2019s nascent economy as we confronted thechallenges of war financing following the Second World War.3. After leaving the Reserve Bank, Shri Deshmukh went on to become theFinance Minister of India, a career graph repeated by our current Prime Minister,Dr. Manmohan Singh nearly forty years later. Shri Deshmukh brought to the officeof the Finance Minister a passion for newly independent India\u2019s development and ahumane and inclusive vision for nation building. By all accounts, Sir ChintamanDeshmukh was one of the finest public policy intellectuals of post-independenceIndia.4. The Reserve Bank instituted the C.D. Deshmukh Memorial Lecture in 1984to honour the memory of this illustrious Governor of the Bank. The last DeshmukhMemorial Lecture was delivered by Lord Adair Turner in February 2010 on: \u201cAfterthe Crisis: Assessing the Costs and Benefits of Financial Liberalization\u201d.Today\u2019s Speaker - Prof. Stiglitz5. It is befitting that the fifteenth C.D. Deshmukh Memorial Lecture today willbe delivered by a pre eminent public policy intellectual and one of the mostinfluential economists of our time. Introducing Prof. Stiglitz is a challenge becauseh e i s so wel l kn own an d th at n o i n troduc ti on can b e ori gi nal or reveali ng. It i s achallenge also because his contribution to public policy has been so enormous andph en om en al th at i t i s di ffi cul t to sum m ari ze th at b ri efly . Nev erth el ess, I wi ll takeon the task of introducing Professor Stiglitz if only to pay homage to a tradition.36. Professor Joseph Stiglitz is currently University Professor at Columbia inNew York and Co-chair of Columbia University\u2019s Committee on Global Thought.7. In 1979, Joseph Stiglitz was awarded the coveted John Bates Clark Medal,given by the American Economic Association to an economist under 40 who hasm a d e th e m os t si gn i fi can t c on t ri b u ti on to th e f i el d . P r of . S ti gl i tz l i v e d u p to th a tearly promise by winning, as we all know, the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2001for his analysis of markets with asymmetric information. He has the distinction, ina sense, of a \u2018double Nobel\u2019 as he was a lead author of the 1995 Report of theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which shared the 2007 Nobel PeacePrize. In 2011, the prestigious Time  magazine named him one of the 100 mostinfluential people in the world.8. Prof. Stiglitz helped create a new branch of economics, \"The Economics ofInformation\", exploring the consequences of information asymmetries andpioneering such pivotal concepts as adverse selection and moral hazard which havenow become standard tools not only of theorists, but also of policy analysts.9. I am sure many in this audience have read his book Globalization and ItsDiscontents . Some of you may have read the authorized edition, some may evenhave read the pirated edition because this seminal book has been translated into 35languages, besides at least two pirated editions. In the non-pirated editions, it hassold more than a million copies worldwide. His most recent book, The Price ofInequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future , hit the New YorkTimes best seller list within a few weeks of publication. The book provides a4powerful critique of the free market orthodoxy, but ends on a note of hope, arguingthat \u2018another world is possible\u2019.Revolution in Monetary Policy10. The topic for Prof. Stiglitz\u2019s Lecture today is: \u201cA Revolution in MonetaryPolicy: Lessons in the Wake of the Global Financial Crisis\u201d.11. Since the topic is about a revolution in monetary policy, I can do no betterthan invoking Vladimir Lenin, something of an authority on revolutions, who said:\u201cA revolution is impossible without a revolutionary situation\u201d. Globalmacroeconomic developments over the past five years have indeed led centralb a n k s t o a r e v o l u t i o n a r y s i t u a t i o n . W h e n t h e c r i s i s h i t f o l l o w i n g t h e c o l l a p s e o fLehman Brothers, central banks acted with an unusual show of policy force,quickly exhausted their conventional tools, then threw out the rule book and wenton an uncharted territory of money creation which has taken many names andmetamorphosed into many acronyms.12. Today, there is quite some bewilderment among policy makers, particularlycentral bankers, about what else can be done to engineer a recovery. Thisbewilderment has spawned a vigorous, interesting and instructive debate on thepursuit of monetary policy. Let me briefly outline some key issues in this debate.Quantitative Easing13. The point of departure in this debate is the view that after policy interestrate has been brought to the zero lower bound, nothing else needs to be done exceptfor the central bank to say that it will keep interest rates low in the future too. It is5argued that this would encourage people to borrow more and spend it, bailing theeconomy out of recession.14. But this idea of topping up monetary easing with communication may notalways work. People may not believe that the central bank will keep its promise oflow interest rates. Even if they believe the central bank, they may not still borrowsince what they are trying to do is to get out of debt rather than get into further debtas is the case today.15. So, how do central banks improve their credibility? By tying their promiseof low interest rates to specific quantitative real sector variables? The US FederalReserve has recently led the way in this direction by saying that it will keep interestrates low as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 per cent, and in thep roc e s s , i s wi l l i n g t o t ol e ra te i n fl a ti on sl i gh tl y ab ov e i ts l on g -ru n ta rg e t. A n oth e rway of reinforcing this promise of low interest rates is the idea of shifting fromtargeting inflation to targeting nominal GDP.Financial Stability16. Quantitative easing has not been the only issue in this monetary policyrevolution. A parallel, if also related, debate has been about the role of financialstability in the monetary policy objective function. This has raised severalquestions. What is the role of central banks in preserving financial stability? Whenand how should they use monetary policy to pursue financial stability?  If youadmit the argument that one instrument can secure only one objective, do centralbanks have the policy instruments to pursue the financial stability objective?6Independence of Central Banks17. A third major debate in monetary policy has been about the independenceof central banks. In recent weeks, we have all seen this issue of central banki n d e p en d en c e pl ay ou t i n J a p an wi th p ol i ti c al p re s s u re s on th e B an k of J a pan toadopt a higher inflation target so as to create more room for growth stimulus. Theexample of Japan is recent and high profile, but by no means an exception; theissue of monetary policy independence has acquired greater potency following theexpansion of the mandates of central banks and their more explicit pursuit of realsector targets such as growth and unemployment.Emerging Market Economies and Monetary Policy Revolution18. Revolution in monetary policy is not exclusive to advanced economycentral banks. Emerging market economy central banks are going through arevolution too with, of course, different nuancing. They have not been inflationtargetters in the strict sense; they have always struggled to maintain the balancebetween growth and price stability. And learning from the experience of severalc o u n t r y s p e c i f i c a n d r e g i o n a l c r i s e s , t h e y h a v e a l s o a d d e d , e i t h e r e x p l i c i t l y o rimplicitly, financial stability to their objective functions.19. Monetary policy revolution in emerging market economy central banks hasan additional dimension, which is that in formulating their monetary policy, theyare having to contend with the forces of globalization, in particular the spilloverimpact of the advanced economy central banks. The \u2018impossible trinity\u2019 asserts thata country cannot simultaneously maintain all three policy goals of free capitalflows, a fixed exchange rate and independent monetary policy. Recent experience7in emerging market economies has demonstrated that the \u2018impossible trinity\u2019 is nolonger a text book paradigm; balancing between these three policy goals isbecoming a practical policy consideration.Monetary and Fiscal Policies20. Even as monetary policy, both in advanced and emerging marketeconomies. is going through a \u2018revolution\u2019, one thing is clear. Central banks cannotfix economies by themselves. Governments need to act too from the fiscal side, andm on e ta ry an d f i sc al p ol i ci es h av e to a c t i n h a rm on y . On top of th i s , g ov e rn an ceneeds to improve to inspire the trust and confidence of consumers and investors.21. The crisis is still with us; and the revolution in monetary policy is still workin progress. But it has thrown up a number of questions. How will this revolutionplay out? What will it mean for the mandates of central banks and the autonomywi th wh i ch th ey wi l l del i v e r on th a t m an d a te? W h o wi l l wi n an d wh o w i l l l os e?And, to sum it all up, what are the lessons from this \u2018revolution\u2019 for monetarypolicy? For answers to these weighty questions, who better to turn to than ProfessorJoseph Stiglitz.22. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Professor JosephStiglitz to deliver the C.D. Deshmukh Memorial Lecture on: \u201cA Revolution inMonetary Policy: Lessons in the Wake of the Global Financial Crisis\u201d.", "13 Mar 13 MP.pdf": "India\u2019s Macroeconomic Challenges  Some R eserve Bank Perspectives1  - Duvvuri Subbarao  _______________________________________________________    First of all many thanks to the London School of Economics for inviting me to deliver the fifth I.G. Patel Memorial Lecture. It is an honour to which I attach immense value.   Dr. I.G. Patel  2. Dr. I.G. Patel represents a special bond between our two institutions - the Reserve Bank which I represent and the LSE where this lecture is instituted. Dr. Patel led bot h these institutions with great dignity and distinction , and is loved and respected by both our institutions .   3. Because the occasion demands it, I must repeat what I said at the Reserve Bank\u2019s Platinum Jubilee  celebrations in 2010 .   4. Those of you who  have an interest in the history of science would know that Sir Isaac Newton was known , among other things, also  for his intellectual arrogan ce. When his friend and rival, Robert Hooke wrote to him, lauding his theory of gravity, Newton, for all his arroga nce, wrote back with uncharacteristic humility :  \u201cIf I h ave been able to see a little fa rther  than others , it is because I am standing on the shoulders of giants.\u201d                                                              1 Fifth I.G.  Patel Memorial Lecture delivered by Dr. Duvvuri Subbarao, Gove rnor, Reserve Bank of India at the London School of Economics on March 13, 2013.  2  5. That is a statement I can relate to. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank in these exciting times, I owe an intellectual debt of gratitude to the extraordinary men who led the Reserve Bank through several challenges, and made a mark in the economic history of I ndia. Among the most distinguished of them is Dr. I.G. Patel. I am privileged to be in the same lineage as him.   6. During his long and illustrious career in India, Dr. Patel made very significant and lasting contribution to economic governance of India. He was Governor of the Reserve Bank at a critical time when the Indian economy had to battle a balance of payments crisis triggered by the second oil price shock  in the late 1970s . He played an active role in securing accommodation for India from the IMF\u2019s  Extended Fund facility, an arrangement that was the largest in the Fund\u2019s history at that time.   7. Indeed, Dr. Patel was the intellectual force behind resolving some of our biggest macroeconomic challenges of his time. As the Governor of the Reserve Ban k today, I am involved in addressing some of India\u2019s current macroeconomic challenges. The leadership that my predecessors provided in confronting these challenges always remain s a source of motivation and inspiration  for me in navigating through these cha llenges . I though t the best way I can honour the memory of late Dr. I.G. Patel is to talk about India\u2019s current macroeconomic challenges from the Reserve Bank \u2019s perspective.  India - Current Macroeconomic Context  8. India clocked an average growth of 9.5 per cent in the three year period before the global financial crisis ( 2005-08). For a nation that once believed that the \u2018Hindu Rate of Growth \u2019 was its destiny, this remarkable growth performance was cause for celebration. It was also a trigger for settin g off an aspiration for double digit growth.  3   9. Today, there is a sharp reversal. Growth has decelerated, inflation is still high and stubborn, the investment rate has declined  sharply and the external sect or is beset with a record high current account de ficit. This downturn has caused widespread anxiety that we may have got derailed from the high growth trajectory. It has also raised a number of questions. Is our growth story faltering? Has India\u2019s potential growth rate declined? Are the growth drivers th at worked our way during 2003 -08 still intact? Has the world lost confidence in India\u2019s growth promise? When will we reach double digit growth, and what indeed should we be doing to get there?   10. My short answer to all these questions is that the India g rowth story is still credible and that the long term growth drivers are still intact. If we do the right things, we can get back on a high growth trajectory. Equally, there is nothing inevitable about the India growth story. We can accelerate growth and improve welfare on ly if we effectively implement wide rang ing economic and governance reforms . Slipping up on this will amount to a costly and potentially irreversible squandering away of opportunities.   11. The Government has to be at the center  of this and lead the process of economic revival. As the central bank and as the regulator of large segments of the financial sector, the Reserve Bank too has an important role to play in this. What I propose to do today is to discuss some important macroeconomic c hallenges from the Reserve Bank\u2019s perspective.   12. In particular, I will discuss three challenges:  (i) Manag ing growth -inflation dynamics  (ii) Mitigating the vulnerability of external sector  (iii) Managing the political economy of f iscal consolidation  4  First Challenge: Manag ing Growth -Inflation Dynamics  Growth  13. The global financial crisis affected virtually every economy  in the world , and India was no exception. But we recovered from the crisis much sooner than even other emerging economies. In the crisis year of 2008/09, growth dropped to 6. 7 per cent, but it recovered  smartly thereafter . In fact, in the two years after the crisis, 20 08/09 and 2009/ 10, growth average d 9.0 per cent which compares favourably with the average growth of 9. 5 per cent in the three years before the crisis. However, last year, 2011/12, growth moderated to 6. 2 per cent, and the first advance estimates suggest  that growth this year may drop further to 5.0 per cent , the lowest in a decade  (Chart -1).  Chart -I: Sharp Deceleration in GDP  growth      14. To understand the latest downtrend, it is important first to understand the pre -crisis growth surge. Several  explanation s are offered for India\u2019s growth acceleration in the pre -crisis period: the impact of economic reforms of the 1990s ; India\u2019s rapid integration with the global economy ; rise of entrepreneurism ; and increase in productivity.  5   15. Underlying all t hese factors was the massive increase in capacity as investment jumped from 26.9 per cent of GDP in 2003 /04 to 38.1 per cent in 200 7/08 (Chart -2). This increase in investment was financed by growing domestic saving , and was accompanied by an increase in productivity driven by improvements in technology, organization, financial intermediation and external and domestic competiti veness . The current account deficit (CAD) during this period averaged just 0.3 per cent of GDP suggesting that the contribution of foreign savings to domestic investment was relativ ely modest . But to the extent foreign saving came by way of foreign direct investment  (FDI), it raised the productivity of overall investment  and resulted in higher exports.   16. In the immediate post -crisis period, even as investment slowed, private consumption demand, which accounts for about 57 per cent of GDP, held up as rural incomes grew robustly on the back of the crisis driven stimulus as well as the expanded safety -net pro grammes of the government. This kept growth up but also fuelled inflation reflecting excess of demand over supply.   2022242628303234363840Per centChart -2: Domestic Saving and Investment (% of GDP)Gross Domestic Saving Gross Domestic Capital FormationDomestic SavingDomestic Capital Formation  6  17. So, what explains the downturn in growth  over the last two years ? The answer would be a slowing of demand across the board. P rivate investment  decelerated sharply , in part reflecting the global downturn , but largely owing to domestic factors. Business profitability was dented by tightening infrastructure constraints and increasin g input prices stemming from high food and fuel inflation . Business confidence was hit by a rising fiscal deficit, vacillating commitment to reforms and governance concerns , all of which dampen ed investor perceptions  on returns to investment.   18. On top of the decline in private investment, private consumption  demand , which was the bulwark of the quick recovery from the crisis , too started slowing in recent years exacerbating the growth slowdown  (Chart -3). It is estimated to have slowed to 4.1 per cent during the current year, down from an average of 8.3 per cent in the previous two years.   -5051015202530Per centChart -3: Annual Growth  in Private Consumption and Investment Private Final Consumption Expenditure Gross Fixed Capital FormationPrivate Final Consumption ExpenditureGross Capital Formation   Inflation  19. Just as India recovered from the crisis sooner than other countries, inflation too caught up with us sooner than elsewhere. Inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), went 7  briefly  into negative territory for a few months in 2009 but started rising sharply thereafter, clocking a peak rate of 10.9 per cent in April 2010. Average WPI inflation was 9.6 per cent in fiscal year 2010/11, 8.9 per cent in 2011/12 and 7.5 per cent during the  first ten months of 2012/13  (Chart -4). The story therefore is that at 8.7 per cent, the average inflation over the last three years has been higher than the average inflation of 5.4 per cent during the previous decade (2000 -10)   What is Driving Inflation?  20. Both supply side and demand side factors have contributed to the buildup  of inflationary pressures.   8  21. A major driver  from the supply side has been food inflation , which has both structural and cyclical components. The structural component arises from rising incomes, especially in rural areas , which is leading  to a shift in dietary habit s from cereals to protein foods. I nflation of protein food prices remained  in do uble digits for much of the last three years barring a few months (Chart -5). The cyclical component of food inflation arises from the monsoon related spike in prices of food items such as vegetables.  Notwithstanding all the talk of drought proofing  the economy , the timely onset of the monsoon and its spatial and temporal distribution  continue to influence the inflation outlook in India.       22. The second major factor driving the current episode of inflation has been global commodity prices, especially the price of crude oil. India imports 80 per cent of its oil demand . The global price of oil is therefore an important variable in determining the inflation outloo k. The depreciation of the rupee , starting October 2011 , has compounded the inflationary impact of oil prices.   23. If the domestic petroleum sector was a free market and if global prices passed through to domestic prices, demand would arguably have decli ned in response to rising prices. But such a 9  demand adjustment was blocked by the administered (subsidized) pricing regime  of petroleum products .   24. Subsidization  did not, however, protect us from inflation pressures - the cost of subsidies raised the fiscal deficit which fuelled inflation. So, any softening of inflation that we gained through subsidization  was offset by a larger fiscal deficit.   25. There is a deb ate in India about the macroeconomic and welfare dimension s of subsidies financed , not by government surpluses, but by government borrowing.  An argument against de -subsidization is that it will be inflationary. Sure, it will be inflationary in the short -term, but price pressures will even out over the medium term. Also, the inflation impact should not be overstated. To the extent lower subsidies result in a lower fiscal deficit, there would be some disinflationary impact even in the short -term. Finally, reduction in subsidies will remove price distortions, improve efficiency and provide a much better investment environment.   26. The third major factor fuelling inflation has been  wage  pressures . Nominal rural wages increased at double digit rates over the la st five years. Indeed , they increased so rapidly that , despite h igh retail inflation, real wage  growth surged close to double digits in the last three years  (Table -1). The Government\u2019s s ocial safety -net programmes contributed to, and sustained , the wage -price spiral.  In an economy with a per capita income of about US $1500, any increase in income quickly translates into increase in consumption demand and that is exactly what was witnessed in India. Producers were able , until very recently , to pass on the higher i nput prices in the form of higher output prices without sacrificing their margins.  10   Table 1: Increase in Rural Wages   Year    Nominal Wage  Increase*   Average CPI (RL) Inflation   Real Wage Increase    (Per cent)   2007 -08    8.9    7.2     1.5 2008 -09 15.9 10.2    5.1 2009 -10 18.0 13.8    3.8 2010 -11 20.0 10.0    8.9 2011 -12 19.9   8.3 10.6 2012 -13 (Apr -Nov)   18.1   9.4   8.0            * Daily wage rate for rural unskilled labourer (male)                CPI (RL): Consumer Price Index for Rural Labour   Growth -Inflation Dynamics  27. India\u2019 s growth -inflation dynamics pre -crisis and post-crisis present a study in contrast. In the three year period before the crisis, the economy expanded by 9. 5 per cent on average , aided by growth in fixed investment above 15 per cent per year . This expanded production capacity to match growing demand and kept core inflation in check. Post -crisis, the story reversed. Investment declined to half its pre -crisis ra te whereas consumption demand remained at the pre -crisis level until last year , owing partly to the government\u2019s entitlement and welfare programmes , opening up a positive output gap during 2009 -11 and stoking core inflation.   11   Two Questions About  Growth -Inflation Dynamics  28. The growth -inflation dynamics of recent years that I briefly summarized above raise two interesting and related policy questions. The first is about India\u2019s potential growth rate and the second is about  why inflation is persi sting at an elevated level even in the face of steeply moderating output growth. Let me briefly address them.   What is India\u2019s Potential Growth Rate ? 29. There is considerable evidence from research done at the IMF and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) that potential growth rates may have declined significantly in both advanced and emerging economies. India too, despite being less integrated with the global economy than other EMEs, has seen a drop in its potential growth rate. Reserve Bank estimate s show that the  potential growth before the crisis was in the range of 8.0 - 8.5 per cent. This estimate was scaled down to 7.0 per cent after the crisi s owing to a host of factors - decline in the pace of capital formation , supply constraints, especially of infrastructure , pressure on factor productivity because of tepid progress on reforms  and a high fiscal deficit .   30. Some analyst s contend that the potential growth rate may have dipped even below the Reserve Bank\u2019s post -crisis estimate of 7 per cent. The argument is that with growth dipping below 7 per cent last year and projected to dip even lower this year, we should have seen inflation and current  account deficit soften. On the other hand, inflation persists at an elevated level and the current account deficit is likely to be the highest ever, suggesting that the economy is growing beyond its capacity and that the potential growth may be lower than  even 7 per cent.   Why are India\u2019s Growth -Inflation Dynamics contrarian?  12  31. The second and related question is about why India\u2019s macroeconomic dynamics are contrarian. In particular, over the last two years, many of our peer EMEs have  also experienced a growth deceleration, but in line with standard theory , several of them have also seen a moderation in their inflation rates. In India , however,  inflation has not come down in line with growth deceleration. Several idiosyncratic factors are put forward to explain this  uniqueness of our macroeconomic situation : supply bottlenecks, particularly in infrastructure, sectoral imbalances, rise in wages without a corresponding increase in productivity, high er fiscal deficit and larger depreciatio n of the exchange rate  than in the case of our peers .   Reserve Bank\u2019s Action to Curb Inflation  32. To control inflation, the Reserve Bank reverse d the crisis period\u2019s accommodative monetary stance in quick order. We raised the policy interest rate (repo rate) 13 times, cumulatively by 375 basis points ( bps) - from 4.75 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Also we raised the reserve requirement on banks - the c ash reserve ratio (CRR) - by 100 bp s from 5 per cent to 6 per cent.  Monetary policy is known to work with lags, and as a consequence of the tight monetary policy, WPI inflation which peaked at  10.9 per cent in April 2010 , has come down to 6.6 per cent in January 2013 .    33. In response to deceleration in growth and decline  in inflation, the Reserve Bank eased the monetary policy stance starting January 2012 cutting both the repo rate (by 75 bps) and the CRR (by 200 bps) .   Criticism Against Reserve Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Stance  13  34. The Reserve Bank has been criticized for i ts anti -inflationary stance. Let me address some of the main strands of that criticism if only to illustrate the dilemmas that we face in managing the growth -inflation trade -off.  Monetary Policy has Only Stifled Growth, But has not Tamed Inflation  35. By far the most common criticism has been that tight monetary policy has stifled growth but has not t amed inflation.  My response to this criticism is the following. First, inflation has come off from its peak by over about 4 percentage points. Admittedly, gro wth too has moderated. However, t he Reserve Bank\u2019s anti -inflation stance is motivated by the dictum that inflation is inimical to growth and that only in  a situation of price stability  can consumers  and investors make informed choices.   36. It is important also to note that i n order to contain inflation, m onetary policy  seeks to curb demand which , in turn , restrains growth. As per this logic, reduction in growth is a n inevitable  outcome of tight monetary policy. But this sacrifice is only in the sh ort-term. In the medium term, there is no growth -inflation trade off; on the contrary, low and stable inflation secures  sustained high  medium term growth. And this is what the Reserve Bank is aiming at.   37. It is important to note in this context that the relationship between growth and inflation is non-linear. At low levels of inflation and stable inflation expectations, there is a trade -off between growth and inflation  - some inflation can be tolerated to grease the wheels of growth . But above a certain threshold level of inflation, this relationship reverses, the conventional trade -off disappears, and high inflation actually starts taking a toll on growth. Estimates by the Reserve Bank using different methodologies put the threshold level of infl ation in the range of 4  to 6 per cent. Inflation above 6 per cent would therefore justify, indeed demand, tightening of the 14  monetary policy stance. It is this understanding that informed the Reserve Bank\u2019s monetary policy stance.   Monetary Policy Tighteni ng is Inappropriate to Combat Supply Shock Driven Inflation   38. A second and related criticism of the Reserve Bank\u2019s anti -inflationary monetary policy stance has been that India\u2019s recent inflation is driven by supply shocks in food and fuel items and that monetary tightening does not help restrain inflation in such a case. It only results in avoidable sacrifice of growth.   39. I have several responses to this criticism. The first is that inflation was driven not just by supply shocks but by demand pressures as well , as evidenced by output expanding faster than the potential growth rate in the immediate post -crisis years of 2009/10 and 2010/11 , the large and growing current account deficit and rapid growth in consumption demand.   40. Admittedly, the re were supply shocks too, in addition to demand pressures,that were stoking inflation pressures . Monetary policy response to supply shocks is a deliberate balancing act because errors can be costly in terms of lost growth. If the judgement  is that the sup ply shock is transitory (such as cyclical increase in vegetable prices), the preferred policy response should be to not respond by monetary tightening. If on the other hand, the judgement is that the supply shock is structural in nature and will persist, m onetary policy has to respond since persistent inflation, no matter what the driver, stokes inflation expectations. Monetary  policy is inevitably the first line of defence to guard against inflation getting generalized through unhinged inflation expectatio ns. The Reserve Bank\u2019s policy response has been gu ided by the above consideration.   15  41.  To sum up, t he surmise from the challenge posed by  the growth -inflation dynamics is the following. Today\u2019s investment is tomorrow\u2019s production capacity. India needs to not only reverse the investment downturn but also increase  it significantly to raise production to match the growing consumption demand. Increa se in investment is necessary also to raise production for exports and thereby create jobs at home. Making this happen requires a supply response from the government by way of providing public goods and creating a conducive environment for private investme nt. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank has to ensure that inflation is brought down to the threshold level and is maintained there.   Second Challenge: Mitigating the Vulnerability of the External Sector  42. Over the last two years, India\u2019s balance of payments (BoP) has come under growing pressure as evidenced most clearly by a large and increasing current account deficit (CAD). The CAD last year (2011/12) was 4.2 per cent of GDP, historically the highest; the CAD during the current year is expected to be even h igher.   43. Many will recall that India went through a balance of payments crisis in 1991 which, in fact, triggered wide ranging structural reforms that gave a market orientation to the economy. Despite India\u2019s growing integration with the global economy, the external sector remained robust for over 15 years after  that. The current episode of BoP pressures, when the CAD is higher than it was at the peak of the 1991 BoP crisis (3 per cent of GDP ) is, therefore,  causing apprehensions about whether we have the  capacity to stem the pressures and restore the BoP to a sustainable path.   44. The increase in CAD is quite evidently a consequence of imports g rowing faster than exports. ( Table -2) 16  Table 2: Balance of Payments    2010/11   2011/12    (USD billion)   Exports   250.5  309.8                (y-o-y growth)  37.4 23.7 Imports  381.1  499.5                (y-o-y growth)  26.8 31.1 Of which            -      Oil 105.1  155.6                (y-o-y growth)  20.6 48.1         -       Gold  40.5 56.5               (y-o-y growth)  41.4 39.5 Trade Balance  (-) 130.5  (-) 189.8  Current Account Deficit  (-) 45.9  (-) 78.2     Capital Flows  62.0 67.8 Reserve Charge  (-) 13.1  12.8    As % of GDP          Exports  14.6 16.5       Imports  22.3 26.7       Trade Balance  (-) 7.6 (-) 10.1        CAD  (-) 2.7  (-) 4.2              Excluding gold (net)  (-) 0.7  (-) 1.5             Excluding oil and gold (net)  3.0 3.8             Capital Flows  3.6 3.6  45. The increase in imports is largely accounted for by oil and gold imports. To understand the pressure these two items have put on the BoP, it is instructive to note the following . Net of 17  oil and gold imports, CAD last year would have been in surplus of 3.8 per cent of GDP in contrast to a deficit of 4.2 per cent of GDP. The surge in gold imports is explained largely by the erosion in real returns on other assets owing to inflation. The reason oil imports have been price inelastic is due to the fact that nearly 60 per cent of petroleum  products pass through an administered  price regime ; oil demand to that extent doe s not adjust to price increases . On the other hand, exports were not helped even though the real exchange rate depreciated, reflecting the fact that in a subdued global economy, exports are more sensitive to inco me (i.e. global demand) than to price.   46. Reflecting the current and capital accounts in the BoP, the exchange rate depreciated both in nominal and real terms ( Table - 3)  Table - 3: Exchange Rate Movement    Nominal Change   Real Change   (Percentage)   2011/12  (March 31, 2012 over March 31, 2011)    (-) 12.7   (-) 17.4  2012/13  (Feb. 28, 2013 over March 31, 2012)   (-)  4.9  (-)  2.8  18   Three Concerns About CAD  47. There are mainly three concerns about the CAD  in the balance of payments : (i) the quantum of CAD; (ii) the quality of CAD; and (iii) the financing of CAD. Let me briefly address each of these.   Quantum of CAD  48. Reserve Bank\u2019s estimates show  that the sustainable CAD for India is 2.5 per cent of GDP. A CAD  above  the sustainable level , year after year, is a clear macroeconomic risk as it raises concerns about our ability to meet our external payment obligations and erodes the confidence of potential lenders and investors.   49. An additional concern is that we are having a large CAD eve n in the face of slowing growth. This is perplexing because economic logic suggests that the CAD should improve in a slowing economy due to a decline in import demand. Cross country evidence in fact supports this hypothesis. Such an adjustment has not mani fested in India though because: (i) oil and gold imports are relatively inelastic to income changes; (ii) on non -oil imports, domestic supply is still unable to compete with imports,  and (iii) supply constraints and subdued external demand are impeding exports.   Quality of CAD  50. The concern about the quality of CAD arises from the composition of imports. If we were importing capital goods, we can maybe countenance a higher CAD because investment in capital goods implies building production capacity for tomorrow. On the other hand,  import of gold, 19  largely as a hedge against inflation, is a deadweight burden, especially at a time when the CAD is beyond the sustainable level.   Financing of CAD  51. Even as the CAD has been high, we have been able to finance it because of a combination  of \u2018push\u2019 and \u2018 pull\u2019 factors. On the push side  is the amount of surplus liquidity in the global system consequent upon the extraordinary monetary stimulus provided by advanced economy central banks. On the pu ll side are the measures taken by us to attract capital flows such as liberalizing FDI, expanding the limits for foreign investment in corporate and government debt  and easing restrictions on external commercial borrowing by corporates.   52. In trying to finance such a large CAD, we are exposing the ec onomy to the risk of sudden stop and exit of capital flows. This will be the case to the extent capital flows in in pursuit of short -term profits. Should the risk of capital exit materialize, the exchange rate will become volatile causing knock -on macroeco nomic disruptions.   Monetary Easing In the Context of a Large CAD  53. While the external sector vulnerability is a cause for concern on a number of counts as I indicated above, it also poses a special challenge for calibrating the monetary policy stance.   54. In our quarterly policy review at the end of January this year, the Reserve Bank cut the benchmark repo rate by 25 bps in response to the growth -inflation dynamics that I outlined earlier. Several analysts and commentators have questioned the wisdom a nd logic of monetary easing at a time when the CAD is rising. There are two elements to this argument: (i) an interest rate cut raises aggregate demand , and hence demand for imports , and will aggravate an already 20  elevated CAD; and (ii) an interest rate cut  will narrow the interest differential between India and the advanced economies which are the source of capital , and could potentially lead to capital exit.  55. Let me respond to both these strands of criticism:   56. The risk of the CAD widening further b ecause of the stimulus offered by the rate cut is much less than apprehended for a host of reasons. First, w hen growth is sluggish as is the case now, the rate cut is unlikely to translate into import demand. Second , the rate cut was a response to softenin g inflation. Lower inflation will improve the competitiveness of our exports. Third , the rate cut was effected during a phase of easing commodity prices - particularly of oil - which will reduce the pressure on the CAD.  Finally, empirical evidence shows th at in emerging economies such as India, import demand is less a function of lower interest rate than of increased income. In other words, the marginal propensity to import by borrowing money is small.   57. On the other criticism about the impact of capital flows required to finance the CAD, it must be noted that interest rate differential is only one of the several push and pull factor s that influence capital flows. Moreover, debt and equity flows have traditionally responded differently to a rate cu t. While debt flows may be more sensitive to a narrowing of the interest rate differential, equity flows may actually increase because they see in this a signal of lower inflation and better investment environment . This has been the experience of India lea ding some analysis to all this, the \u2018India n exceptionalism\u2019.   58. The last thought I want to leave with you on the issue of managing  the external sector vulnerability  is that gone are the days when monetary policy could be calibrated on entirely 21  domestic macroeconomic con siderations . As India integrates rapidly with the world in the years ahead, it will perforce have to take into account the spillover from global situation in determining its monetary policy stance .   Third Challenge: Managing the Political  Economy of Fiscal Consolidation  59. The large fiscal deficit of the gov ernment remains one of India\u2019s  biggest macroeconomic challenges . Received wisdom today is that i t was the fiscal profligacy of the 1980s that spilled over into the external sector and fuelled the balance of payments crisis of 1991. In 2011/ 12, the combined fiscal deficit of the centre and state governments was 8.1 per cent,  quite close to the figure of 9.1 per cent in the BoP crisis year of 1990/91  (Chart -6). Quite understandably, there are concerns about the adverse macroeconomic consequences of the twin deficit problem - a large and persistent  fiscal deficit  along with a high CAD .  60. There has been some very welcome , although much delayed,  action on correct ing both the CAD and the fiscal deficit over the last six months. The Government has raised customs duty on gold imports in an effort to restrain gold imports. More notably, the recent budget has firmly embraced fiscal responsibility by restraining the fis cal deficit next year consistent with the road map recommended by the Kelkar Committee.  22    61. In the pre -crisis period, India\u2019s fiscal consolidation was largely on track, consistent with the targets adopted under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003.  However, this consolidation got interrupted by the crisis induced fisca l stimulus. Thereafter, the government adopted a revised road map for getting fiscal consolidation  back on track , and adhere d to the target in 2012/13.  Nevertheless, the combined fiscal debit of the centre and states, budgeted at 7.2 per cent of GDP during  2012/13 is still high. Notwithstanding political economy compulsions, credible fiscal adjustment along a transparent, predictable road map is an imperative for growth and macroeconomic stability.   Why is Fiscal Deficit Bad?  62. Fiscal deficit  is bad for a number of reasons. Large and persistent fiscal deficit threaten s the government\u2019s debt sustainability . The growing interest burden eat s into the resources 23  available for discretionary expenditure. Importantly, it crowd s out the private sector from  the debt market, inhibit s private investment and affect s future production capacity. Fiscal deficit  can also spill  over and trigger balance of payments pressures  as indeed happened in India in 1991 .   63. By far the biggest concern stemming from a large fiscal deficit, especially from the Reserve Bank\u2019s perspective, is that it adds to aggregate demand and thereby to inflation pressures. By crowding out the private sector, fiscal deficit could also inhibit , if not impair , monetary policy transmission to the private sector. Credible fiscal consolidation is, therefore, a necessary pre -condition for stabilizin g inflation and securing non -inflationary growth.   Fiscal Consolidation and Growth  64. There are some c oncerns, admittedly marginal, that fiscal consolidation in a sluggish growth environment will only dampen growth further thereby adversely impacting revenues and pushing the economy into a vicious downward spiral. There is some validity to th is argument. But a growth slow -down on account of fiscal consolidation is not unavoidable. Growth slow -down can be mitigated, indeed growth can be aided , provided attention is paid, along with the quantum of fiscal adjustment, also to its quality. Experience demonstrates that even if total expenditure as a proportion of GDP is curtailed, it need not dampen growth; on the contrary, if there is switching from current expenditure to capital  expenditure , fiscal consolidation can actually st imulate growth by \u2018crowding in\u2019 private investment.   65. Empirical estimates for India validate this finding - even in a context of dec line in total public expenditure as a proportion to GDP, fiscal consolidation can improve medium -term growth prospects i f government increases capital spending, offsetting the moderating impact of 24  growth in the short -term. These results reflect the higher long -run fiscal multipliers for capital expenditure and very low long -run multipliers for current expenditure.   66. The economic s of fiscal consolidation are quite straight forward. The complexity arises from the political economy. Tax increases and expenditure compression - the two strands of fiscal consolidation - are never politically popular, especially in democracies where political executives , virtually everywhere in the world, are characterized by high discount rates. They are much more tempted by short -term political pay offs rather than long -term sustainability . Fiscal consolidation, by definition, is a long -term g ame. In the short -term political costs may exceed benefits; in the long -term, the economic and political benefits far outweigh any costs. It is this congruence of economic and political virtue that must inform fiscal consolidation.   Summing -up: India Growth Story Intact  67. Let me now sum up. I have spoken to you about the following three macroe conomic challenges confronting India and I have given you the Reserve Bank \u2019s perspective on them.  (i) Managing the growth -inflation dynamics  (ii) Mitigating the vulnera bility of the external sector  (iii) Managing the Political Economy of Fiscal Consolidation   68. These are formidable challenges, but by no means insurmountable. For people who despair, it is important to remember that the drivers of the India growth story - get up and go entrepreneurism, the demographic dividend, a large and growing middle class, the opportunity for productivity catch up, democracy and a decent le gal system - are all intact.   25  69. The 12th Five Year Plan aims at a growth rate of 8.2 per cent for the Plan period (2012 -17). Growth at this pace is the minimum necessary. Indeed, India needs to grow even faster , at a sustained double digit pace , if it has to pull hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. The India growth story has all the ingredients to deliver on this promise.   70. But the India growth story is not inevitable. It will not materialize in the absence of vigorous and purposef ul structural and go vernance reforms.  It is those reforms that must continue to engage our attention.  ", "8 Mar 13 MP.pdf": "Is There a New Normal for Inflation?1 - Duvvuri Subbarao  __________________________________________________   India recovered from the global financial crisis ahead of most other countries, but inflation too caught up with us sooner than elsewhere. As measu red by the wholesale price index (WPI),  inflation  went marginally into negative territory for a few months into the crisis in 2009 and started rising sharply thereafter , clocking a peak rate of 10.9 per cent in April 20102. Average WPI inflation was  9.6 pe r cent in fiscal year 2010/11 , 8.9 per cent in 2011/12 and 7.5  per cent during the first ten months  of 2012/13  (Chart -1).                                                         1 Speech delivered by Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Bankers\u2019 Club, New Delhi on March 8, 2013 . 2 The last time India experienced  more than  three successive years of inf lation above 7.5 per cent was during 1990 -96 2  New Normal Hypothesis  2. Despite this high episode of inflation  playing out over the last three years , the Reserve Bank has con sistently maintained in all its policy review s that its objective is to  \u201c\u2026 condition and contain perception of inflation in the range of 4.0 -4.5 per cent. This is in line with the medium -term objective of 3.0 per cent inflation consistent with India\u2019s broa der integration into the global economy .\u201d    3. In recent months, some analysts have questioned the Reserve Bank \u2019s resolve to bring inflation down to this level given the trend of stubborn and persistent inflation. Their main contention is that average WPI  inflation over the last three years for which data are available (February  2010 - January 2013) , at 8.8 per cent , is significantly higher than the average inflation of 6.0 per cent in the three years before the Lehman collapse (September  2005 - August 2008) suggesting that India\u2019s inflation rate has undergone a n upward phase shift owing to a host of domestic and global developments. Monetary policy calibration, it is argue d, can get flawed unless the Reserve Bank acknowledges this new normal.   4. The Reser ve Bank does not agree with this \u2018new normal\u2019 argument. Indeed it is this intellectual conviction that inf ormed our efforts to rein in inflation over the last three years as we brought inflation from double digit levels to below 7 per cent. The centra l task of this speech is to present the Reserve Bank\u2019s position on the \u2018new normal\u2019 debate.    3  Arguments in Support of a New Normal  5. In order to make my case, let me first summarize the arguments put forward by various analys ts in support of a new normal.   (i) Wage -Price Spiral  is a Permanent Shock to the Inflation Path  6. The first argument for a \u2018new normal\u2019 stems from the steep increase in rural wages over the last few years that has set  off a wage -price spiral. Nominal r ural wages increased at double digit rates over the last f ive years.  Indeed they increased so rapidly that despite high retail inflation, real wages too surged at close to double digits in the last three years  (Table -1).   Table 1: Increase in Rural Wages   Year    Nominal Wage  Increase*   Average CPI (RL) Inflation   Real Wage Increase    (Per cent)   2007 -08    8.9    7.2    1.5 2008 -09 15.9 10.2   5.1 2009 -10 18.0 13.8   3.8 2010 -11 20.0 10.0   8.9 2011 -12 19.9   8.3 10.6 2012 -13 (Apr -Dec) 18.1   9.4   8.0            * Daily wage rate f or rural unskilled labourer (male)   Source: Labour Bureau , Shimla    7. By far the most dominant driver of rural wages has been the Government\u2019s affirmative action programmes , both by way of transfer payments (subsidies) and welfare programmes, 4  which have s ignificantly raised the demand for wage goods  while also restraining supply of labour at low wages.  Two other factors  exacerbated the wage -price spiral . First, the large public employment programme has not only pushed up wages, but also exerted upward pres sure on agricultural input prices and thereby on food prices. Second, even as wages have increased, there has been no corresponding increase in productivity  - a recipe for inflation .  8. The \u2018new normal\u2019 argument drawing from this is that it will be politi cally difficult to reverse these entitlement programmes , they  are here to stay , and that  India should accept wage -price pressure s as a structural feature and adjust its inflation goal  accordingly.   (ii) Commodity Pr ice Pressures will Persist  9. Given the tepid recovery of advanced economies from the crisis and consequent sluggish demand, the expectation was that global prices of commodities, especially of crude, would remain soft. On the contrary, commodity prices have surged compared to the pre-crisis period (excluding the highly volatile two years of the crisis) and have remained firm at that level (Chart  - 2). 5    Source: IMF and PPAC, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas   10. Several forces that will extend into the medium -term, it is argued, will work  to keep commodity prices firm. First, oil producers, notwithstanding assurances  to the contrary, will calibrate  supply to ensure a minimum floor price for crude. Second, \u2018financialization of commodities \u2019, a catch phrase used to describe a spike in commodi ty prices quite unrelated to fundamentals, that gathered  momentum  thanks  to the buildup  in global liquidity provided by the unprecedented quantitative easing (QE) in advanced economies  is here to stay. Th is creates an  asymmetry between financial market con ditions and the real economy that will remain a structural feature of the global economy . The third argument in support of higher commodity prices is made on the basis of long -term fundamentals. These will stem from several factors: a larger world populati on, up  from 7 billion in 2012 to over 9 billion in 2050 , higher per capita energy consumption as emerging and developing economies \u2018catch up\u2019  on GDP levels , and the recovery of advanced economy growth to normal levels.  6   11. The new normal argument in this  context is that these global price pressures will transmit to Indian prices either because of actual imports or because of largely import parity pricing , thereby stoking inflation pressures .   (iii) The Positive Supply Shock of the Great Moderation  Has Ru n Out  12. The world enjoyed an extended period of extraordinary price stability during the Great Moderation of the pre -crisis years. As we now know, this was largely the benign influence of the integration of emerging economies , especially China, into the global economy. Through the 80s and 90s, China alone added over a billion people to the global labour pool . This raised global production, but  without commensurate increase in demand , and hence  prices remained low.   13. The world, it is argued, will not r eturn to the \u2018Great Moderation\u2019 situation post -crisis. As China goes forward on its \u2018rebalancing\u2019 from external demand to domestic demand, the global economy will see shrinking of low cost supplies from China and hence higher prices.  The era of cheap impor ts is over and done for ever.   14. The new normal argument in this context runs as follows. Because the positive supply shock from China has all but waned, global inflation will shift to a new normal once the recovery is complete. The Reserve Bank\u2019s implici t formula is to calibrate its comfort level of inflation some  2-3 percentage points above the average rate of inflation in advanced economies , while also aiming to converge  to the world average inflation in the medium -term. If so, i t should recognize the n ew global normal for inflation and recalibrate its comfort level for domestic inflation accordingly.   (iv) Quantitative Easing  will Lead to Higher Inflation in Advanced Economies  7   15. Advanced economy central banks have battled the global financial crisis  with an unusual show of policy force by resorting to unprecedented levels of \u2018Quantitative Easing\u2019. It is argued that this excess will haunt their economies through higher and persistent inflation once they recover to an equilibrium level .   16. Will adva nced economies have an incentive to battle th ose inflation pressures ? Possibly not. Given their extraordinary fiscal pressures and consequent heavy obligation of public debt servicing , they may in fact find it a convenient way to inflate their way out of d ebt.  17. The Indian dimension of this global outlook is as follows . If higher level of inflation in advanced economies  on the way forward is inevitable, India should recognize this , and factor it into its policy calculus  consistent with its goal of inflat ion a few percentage points above the average inflation in AEs .   (v) India should Exploit the Positive Relationship Suggested by the Philips Curve   18. Macroeconomists have long struggled with the dilemma posed by the Philips Curve relationship. The Phili ps Curve is just an empirically observed positive relationship between inflation and growth (or an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment). Notwithstanding subsequent economic research, some of it rewarded with Nobel Prizes, which showed t hat the Philips Curve trade -off has no theoretical basis, t here is a school of thought that monetary policy can exploit this inflation -growth trade -off to achieve higher growth (or low er unemployment) by tolerating slightly higher inflation.   19. For those  who believe in the Philips Curve trade -off, India presents a persuasive case for bargaining away a bit of inflation t o secure higher growth because the multiplier impact of 8  higher growth on poverty reduction  will be larger in the case of India . But wouldn \u2019t higher inflation hurt the poor? The proponents argue that it will not because higher real incomes will raise purchasing power to more than offset the impact of higher inflation.   20. It should be noted that the new normal inflation argument deriving from the Philips Curve is different from the earlier arguments  in one important way . The earlier arguments have an involuntary dimension. I ndia cannot influence these forces ; it has to perforce adjust  to them. In contrast, the Philips Curve argument involves  a voluntary policy choice  of accepting higher inflation to secure higher growth . Should that choice be made, it will require the Reserve Bank to recalibrate  its inflation goal at a higher level.   (vi) PPP Convergence on Account of India\u2019s Integration int o the Global Economy will Imply Accepting a New Normal for Inflation    21. This argument is based on the Balassa -Samuelson effect which says that the absolute price level in a developing economy needs to converge with those of developed economies as it integrates into the global economy on account of \u2018PPP\u2019  (purchasing power parity) catch up. In the process of this catch -up, wages may increase ahead of productivity levels, especially in the non-tradeable sector, leading to inflation.   22. India\u2019s integratio n with the global economy over the last ten years has been much more rapid than we tend to acknowledge, and over the next ten years, it will be much more rapid than we tend to believe. The Economic Survey of 2011/12 had argued that this PPP convergence process for India over the next 30 years would involve an additional inflation of 2 percentage points with no exchange rate adjustment and 1.5 per centage points if the rupee is allowed to 9  appreciate. The counsel to monetary authorities accordingly is to acqu iesce in this \u2018new normal\u2019 and support growth to hasten the process of PPP catch up.   Debate About a New Normal not Unique to India  23. Interestingly, the debate about a new normal for inflation is not unique to India; it is playing out in several countri es in the post -crisis context  in, of course , different ways .   24. As early as in 2000, Bernanke3  had argued that the Bank of Japan\u2019s  (BoJ) monetary policy had hit the Keynesian liquidity tra p, and that the BoJ should raise its inflation tolerance to 3 to 4 per cent in order to fl og the deflationary forces.   25. As the global financial crisis unfolded , Bernanke found himself at the receiving end of similar advice when Blanchard et al.4 and Krugman5 had, separately and ind ependently , argued that the Federa l Reserve should raise its inflation target from 2 per cent to 4 per cent in order to give itself larger head  room for conventional monetary easing  and thereby avoid , or at any rate delay , recourse to unconventional monetary easing . Quantitative estimates have reinforced this argument by showing that at an inflation target of 4 per cent, the p robability  of the Fed Funds Rate touching zero is less than 1 per cent. The Fed has , however, resisted this call for a higher                                                    3      Ben S  Bernanke, \u201cJapanese Monetary Policy: A Case of Self -induced Paralysis\u201d, Institute for International Economics, Special Report 13, September 2000.   4 Olivier Blanchard, Giovanni Dell\u2019  Ariccia, and Paolo Mauro , \u201cRethinking Macroeconomic Polic y\u201d, IMF Staff Position Note, February 12, 2010.   5     Paul Krugman, \u201cEarth to Ben Bernanke: Chairman Bernanke Should Listen to Professor Bernanke\u201d, New York Times, August 24, 2012  10  inflation target by arguing that this exp oses the economy to the risk of higher inflation by unhinging inflation expectations.6  26. More recently, a higher inflation target debate played out in Japan in a more high profile fashion. In deference to the electoral commitment of the incoming governm ent to provide a growth stimulus , the Bank of Japan raised its goal of 1% inflation to a target of 2% inflation  which it hopes to achieve through unlimited bond purchase .  27. In the UK, a battle of ideas is playing out on how to revive the sagging economy . The Government has firmly embraced a fiscal consolidation plan , but the private sector is yet to take up the slack left by the Government and  demand  is yet to revive.  The burden of stimulating the economy has  therefore  fallen on the Bank of England (BoE) , an inflation targeter, which found itself consistently oversho oting its inflation target  over several successive months till mid -2012.    28. This policy context has triggered a debate in the UK on whether inflation targeting is an appropriate policy stan ce in the face of unyielding recession. One option as suggested by Mark Carney, soon to be BoE Governor, is that central banks could consider targeting nominal GDP instead of inflation. Nominal GDP targeting , by reducing uncertainty about how long monetary  policy will stay easy, allows a central bank to persist with an accommodative monetary stance to stimulate growth even if inflation is above its comfort level. This is not costless though. I t increases uncertainty about future inflation and can therefore potentially unhinge inflation expectations from their anchor around the targeted inflation.                                                       6 Esther L George, \u201cThe US Economy and Monetary Policy\u201d, Federal Reserve  Bank of Kansas City.  11  29. Even as these debates about a new normal for inflation are becoming more commonplace  around the world , the context similarity between India and advanced econ omies should not be stretched . The concern in advanced economies is about how to continue with the stance of monetary easing even after the policy interest rates have hit the zero lower bound  so as to minimize loss of employment and output. The concern in emerging economies in general, and India in particular, on the contrary , is an aspiration for higher growth aimed at poverty reduction, even if it entails higher, albeit  not much higher , inflation. It is important to  acknowledge this vital difference in ev aluating the arguments for and against a higher \u2018normal for inflation\u2019.   Why is it Important to Recognise if There is a New Normal  for Inflation ? 30. It is important because not recognizing an upward long-term structural shift in \u2018normal inflation\u2019 can le ad to a flawed monetary policy stance with potentially heavy macroeconomic costs.   31. This can be understood in the paradigm of type -I and type -II errors in statistical analysis. If indeed there is a new normal and it is not recognized, this could lead t o an overtightening of monetary policy, a type -II error. But there could be a type -I error too if the new normal is wrongly recognized and monetary conditions are kept accommodative for too long, ther eby fuelling higher inflation. Theory also tells us that  efforts to minimize one type of error result in maximizing the other type of error. So, where should the balance lie? Even if there is arguably a new normal for inflation, wouldn\u2019t it be more prudent to err on the side of caution? And what will be the price to be paid for that prudence on the inflation front  in terms of lost growth ?   32. Central banks face a complex policy choice in managing the growth -inflation balance. Experience shows that policy mistakes cannot easily be reversed in short order, and t ypically not 12  before heavy costs have been paid by way of welfare loss. At the same time, the probability of policy mistakes  is high because it is difficult to get an accurate estimate of the potential growth rate of the economy in real time .   33. Economic  history of the last 50 years , especially of the US , contains  several instances where central banks are alleged to have made costly errors. The best known example is the Volcker disinflation policy of the early 1980s . Paul Volcker , the Fed Chairman  of the time, is largely credited with restoring price  stability in the US , but subsequently there have been questions about whether too high a price was p aid for it by way of two recessions and a surge in unemployment . Was there , in fact , a new higher normal for US inflati on that Volcker did not recognize?  If indeed there was, how does it square with the low inflation experience of the US over the last two decades? This is a debate that is yet to be settled.   34. The importance of having an accurate estimate of the \u2018normal  values \u2019 of the fundamental economic variables of an economy - potential growth  rate, natural rate of unemployment and threshold inflation - in order to accurately calibrate policy  got reinforced recently in the context of the US Fed\u2019s announceme nt in December 2012 that it will maintain its current easy monetary policy stance \u2018as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 per cent\u2019  provided inflation is only slightly above its target and long -term inflation expectations remain anchored . This  has raised a question  about whether the Fed has accepted 6.5 per cent as the new normal for unemployment. It has raised an even more important question about whether 6.5 per cent unemployment is, in fact, an underestimate in which case the Fed would run t he risk of maintaining its e asy stance for far too long , thereby stoking inflation.    13   New Normal - Counter Arguments   35. Let me now put across the Reserve Bank\u2019s assessment and position on each of the arguments for new normal as summarized earlier.   (i) Wage -Price Spiral  cannot Sustain Indefinitely  36. The thrust of our response to the wage -price spiral argument is that even if inclusive growth policies, liberal fiscal entitlements and heightened inflation expectations - drive n primarily by food inflati on - trigger a wage -price spiral, it cannot be sustained  in the absence of an accommodative monetary policy . Admittedly, wage pressures, unaccompanied by productivity increases, start off as demand shocks, but soon transform to act more like supply shocks.    37. Like any other supply shock, exogenously imposed higher wages can be inflationary in the first round, but the bargaining power of labour will erode in time , and the necessary adjustment will take place to bring wage s back in line with productivity l evels. The recent high growth in rural wages also reflects a catch up with minimum wages , a necessary adjustment intended  by the Government. After the initial catch -up, however, wage growth cannot be sustained without corresponding productivity  increases . If not, firms will gradually lose their power to translate higher input prices to higher output prices , inevitably lead ing to a correction in the wage pressures.   38. Furthermore, we must recognize that the Government does not have the fiscal capacity to continue entitlements and welfare programmes at this level. The Government\u2019s embrace fiscal responsibility will act as a self -limiting check on the wage -price spiral.  14   (ii) Commodity Price Shock s are Unlikely to Persist  39. Even as the arguments in support of continued upward pressure on global commodity prices are compelling, there are some credible arguments to the contrary , drawing mainly from an alternate energy scenario going forward. The global energy scenario will change on three dimensions - efficien cy, demand and supply .   40. On the efficiency front, regulatory and compet itive pressures will ensure that gains from energy efficiency will continue to roll in, possibly at an accelerated pace . From the demand perspective, t he impact of these efficiency gains on emerging economies will be larger , in the sense that the e nergy  intensity of their GDP growth will be lower than that of advanced economies when the lat ter were at similar levels of GDP. China  is, in fact,  projected to move onto a less energy -intensive development path by 2020.   41. From the supply perspective, the shale revolution, first for gas and then for oil, is expected to contribute almost a fifth of the increase in global energy supply by 2030. A roughly similar positive contribution  is likely from renewable sources of energy - expected to treble by 2030 .  Growing domestic production and near flat consumption may see the US become self -sufficient in energy by 2030. Supply from Iraq is projected to increase steadily , and by 2030 it is likely  to become the second largest global oil exporter, overtaking Russia.    42. Add to all this, the lessons of experience. For over a century  now, commodity prices have been prone to mean reversion . There is no reason why this time it should be very different .   43. Admittedly, gains on the e nergy front will translate to gains on the inflation front only if other policies are managed intelligently. In particular, demand for land from industrialization and 15  urbanization should not be allowed to crowd out bi o-fuel production. Simultaneously, agricultural productivity needs to increa se so as to meet the food requirements of a growing population even if some land is ceded for bio -fuel cultivation.    44. The thrust of the Reserve Bank\u2019s argument is that the current and projected trends for the global energy scenario do not provide a p ersuasive case for r aising India\u2019s \u2018normal inflation\u2019.    (iii) Global Rebalancing will Ensure Benign Inflation  45. The new normal argument that I cited earlier is that China\u2019s ability to  exert downward pressure on global prices will wane. It certainly will, but only gradually . Given the size of China\u2019s economy, it will continue to be the world\u2019s cheap manufacturer for at least the next decade , thereby keeping global inflation under check.  Even as  China moves up the value chain, the space vacated by it will be occupied by other emerging and developing economies . All this suggests that multiple poles of global growth and competitive pressures  will ensure that global inflation remain s benign for at least the next decade. The argument that India must recalibrate its inflation higher because global inflation is going to be higher loses its potency if , in fact,  higher global inflation is not a credible threat .   (iv) QE - No Risk to Global Inflat ion in the Medium -Term 46. Let me now address the argument about advanced economies suffering higher inflation down the road because of QE. There is a view  that this threat is being exaggerated. Advanced economy central banks, especially the US Fed, have r epeatedly asserted that they have in place well thought through plans to unwind QE in a non -inflationary way. Also note that  long term inflation expectations in advanced economies do not suggest any risk to price stability.    16  47. Most importantly, nothing hurts the election  prospect s of a democratic government more than rising prices.  Political economy compulsions will therefore ensure that governments do not resort to inflating their way out of debt.   (v) The Philips Curve Relationship does not Provide a Realistic Policy Option   48. Experience since the 1990s demonstrates that the secular growth -inflation trade -off suggested by the Philips curve does not hold at all levels of inflation. The relationship is indeed non-linear and reversible. There is a thres hold level of inflation, below which it might be possible to exploit the growth -inflation trade -off. However, i f inflation is above the threshold, it is decidedly inimical to growth as higher inflation does not raise, but actually lowers the growth rate.    49. Mohanty et al. (2011) 7 have estimated that the threshold inflation for India is in the range of 4. 0 per cent to 5.5  per cent . Updated estimat es, using the same methodology , yield a range of 4.4 per cent to 5.7 per cent, implying a mid -point rate of about 5.0 per cent. Even though an estimated threshold inflation rate need not be the optimal inflation target for a central bank, it nevertheless provides a reference point for calibrating the \u2018normal inflation \u2019. The surmise is that empirical research doe s not support the case for a new normal .   (vi) New Normal on Account of PPP Convergence is not Inevitable  50. Apart from all the empirical arguments, there is also an important conceptual argument against the \u2018new normal\u2019 hypothesis. As India\u2019s integrati on with the world picks up pace over the next decade, it is important also that our inflation rate is in line with global inflation. A new                                                    7 Deepak Mohanty, A B Chakraborty, Abhiman Das and Joice John, \u201cInflation Threshold in India: An Empirical Investigation \u201d W P S (DEPR) : 18 / 2011  17  normal based entirely on domestic considerations will result in a permanent wedge between domestic and global inflati on which means a persistent real appreciation of currency. Real appreciation is unambiguously contractionary and militates against our growth aspiration. To support sustainable growth during a period when the economy is globalizing, our inflation rate need s to converge with the global inflation  rate.  This is the rationale behind the Reserve Bank\u2019s policy of calibrating its medium term inflation goal to global inflation.   51. This is an appropriate context for me to respond to the argument for a new normal based on the PPP convergence argument. Our view on this is that PPP convergence cannot be a policy goal, and accepting higher inflation to aid PPP catch up will be both futile and indefensible . As India\u2019s per capita income  rises, PPP convergence will happe n automatically. We need to make sure that rise in incomes is accompanied by productivity gains so that the process of PPP catch up is non -inflationary.    52. There is also no a priori reason to believe that the entire burden of adjustment on account of integration with the global economy will have to come by way of the price differential  closing . Part, if not all, of the burden can be borne by exchange rate adjustment too as evidenced by the experience of Japan starting the 1960, when the yen appreciated by over 300 per cent to close the price gap. How the burden of adjustment is shared between price levels and exchange rates will depend on country circumstances - in particular the economy\u2019s structural constraints and market rigidities.   53. To support su stainable growth during a period when the economy is globalizing, our inflation rate needs to converge with the global inflation rate. We need to manage this 18  convergence by calibrating the \u2018inflation differential\u2019 over time rather than ac quiescing in a new  normal for inflation.   Conclusion  54. Admittedly, the average inflation rate in India over the last three years has trended up .  Nevertheless, the context presents neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the Reserve Bank to revise its inflatio n goal. Not a necessary condition because , as indicated earlier, much of our inflation is driven by supply constraints which can be corrected by appropriate policies and their effective implementation. Accepting a new normal for inflation not only has no t heoretical or empirical support, but entails the moral hazard of policy inaction  in dealing with supply constraints. Not a sufficient  condition because there is no empirical evidence to establish that the benefits of higher growth outweigh the costs of wel fare loss associated with higher inflation .   55. Key to our collective national aspiration for sustained high economic growth is low and steady inflation. It is only under such an environment of price stability that investors and consumers can make inform ed choices and contribute to growth. The responsibility of the Reserve Bank in this regard is to a nchor inflation expectations and ensur e price stability . Neither theory nor empirical evidence pre sents a credible case for acquiescing in a new normal for inflation  in India .

I intend to cover some of the global risks and policy challenges from the perspective of emerging market economies (EMEs).  We are aware that most EMEs have emerged more resilient than before from a turbulent 2018. For the greater part of 2018 , the EMEs faced a wave of global spillover risks leading to capital outflows, currency and asset price volatility  and tightened financial conditions. These developments posed risks to growth and inflation. Strong fundamentals,  forex reserve buffer s, capital in banking systems and prudent macroeconomic policies , however, enabled these economies to absorb global spillovers. Yet, as Agustin Carstens and Hyun Song Shin soberingly point  out, \u201cEMEs aren\u2019t out of the woods yet \u201d.1   Global Risks   Let me highlight three major risks confronting EMEs in 2019.   2.  The biggest risk facing these economies is the growing evidence that global growth and trade is weakening. Unsettled trade tensions and developments around Brexit are imparting further downside risks to the                                                             1 Foreign Affairs, March 15, 2019.  2  outlook. There is considerable uncertainty as to whether this weakness is temporary or the beginning of a recession in advanced economies. This uncertainty also seems to be reflected in several  downward revisions to the 2019 global growth forecast by the I MF. Moreover, central banks across the world are stepping back from tightening monetary policy and some of them are promoting easier lending conditions. In some economies, fiscal stimuli are being used to support growth.   3. The second risk is that EMEs remain vulnerable to financial market volatility  as the experience of 2018 has shown. The risk of sudden stops and reversals of capital flows has increased. Consequent external financing gaps and currency depreciations could undermine the outlook for  growth and macroeconomic stability for these economies,  just when global growth had begun to show signs of a synchroni sed revival a decade after the global financial crisis.  Furthermore, adverse financial conditions could aggravate existing stress in the balance sheets of lending institutions  in some EMEs and stretch their capital requirements.    4. The third risk to EMEs is the high volatility in international oil prices. For net energy importers like India, the recent firming up of oil prices on production cuts by major suppliers present s risks to current account deficit  and inflation. The financialisation of energy markets and changing underlying dynamics in the global oil market are adding an upside risk to prices,  though the  demand is subdued. While  break- even costs for shale production have apparently increased, investors have turned risk averse and are focusing on cash flows and financial returns. This may reduce the 3  flexibility of shale output in filling the shortfalls created by OPEC plus production cuts.  Policy Challenges   So, in this environment, what are the policy challenges faced by EMEs?  5.  In the aftermath of the global financial crisis  (GFC) , several EMEs have embarked upon structural reforms to reorient their economies. In the short -run, however, these reforms inevitably involve sacrifices, including in terms of losses of growth momentum. Conventionally , these reforms are best undertaken in the expansionary phase of the economic cycle. With growth slowing down in a synchronis ed manner across borders, the space for undertaking and/or pushing ahead with structural reforms is likely to become severely constricted or even deterred. But the fact r emains that we need more structural reforms precisely when the economy is slowing down  to ensure durable momentum to growth.  This is a point which I would like to stress.   6.  As the global economy loses speed and with fiscal space getting squeezed, the focus in EMEs as well as advanced economies is likely to be on monetary policy as the first line of defence. Central banks may once again be expected to assume the mantle of guardians of the world economy. The global financial crisis has, however, exposed several limitations  of conventional and unconventional monetary policy tools. In despair, some have turned to the heterodox evolution of ideas that has come to be known as modern monetary theory. While the jury is still out on this idea, I have my own strong reservations on this due to its serious downside risks.  In the end,  monetary policy must touch the real economy, spur investments, and maintain monetary and financial stability.  4   7. I do, however, feel that the time has come to think out of the box, including by challenging the conventional wisdom .  Let me try and somewhat  shock you with one such thought experiment. Typically, modern central banks with interest rates as their main instrument move in baby steps \u2013 25 basis points or multiples thereof \u2013 and announce a stance of tightening, neutrality or accommodation to guide the markets and the public on the likely futu re course of policy. One thought that comes to my mind is that if the unit of 25 basis points is not sacrosanct and just a convention, monetary policy can be well served by calibrating the size of the policy rate to the dynamics of the situation and the si ze of the change itself can convey the stance of policy. For instance, if easing of monetary policy is required but the central bank prefers to be cautious in its accommodation, a 10 basis points reduction in the policy rate would perhaps communicate the intent of authori ties more clearly than two separate moves \u2013  one on the policy rate, wasting 15 basis points of valuable rate action to rounding off, and the other on the stance , which in a sense, binds future policy action to a pre- committed direction. Lik ewise, in a situation in which the central bank prefers to be accommodative but not overly so, it could announce a cut in the policy rate by 35 basis points if it has judged that the standard  25 basis points is too little, but its multiple , i.e., 50 basis points is too much.  This approach can also be useful when the central bank is on a tightening mode and potentially help avoid policy turnaround from forward guidance via stance too far into the future, which in a highly volatile global scenario, may not even be a year.  I am articulating th is idea not necessarily in search of a theory but in search of traction with domain experts and more particularly, 5  with practitioner central bankers who face these dilemmas in their day- to-day lives.   8.   At another level, a formidable challenge that EMEs will continue to face is the management of global spillovers. We live in a world of mobile  capital flows  where consequences of their arrivals, sudden stops and reversals are to be borne nationally. Against t his backdrop, a truly global financial safety net remains elusive. T he strengthening of resources of the IMF gets pushed out into time whenever  we come together for Spring or Annual meetings. Under these conditions, EMEs which are typically at the receiving end when global spillovers flare up, have no recourse but to build their own forex reserve buffers. Paradoxically, the accumulation of reserves has become stigmati sed, including with labels such as \u201c currency manipulat ion\u201d. As I see it, we may be unintentionally setting the stage for several EME currencies to break  out and challenge  the hegemony of the dominant reserve currencies.  There is a need for greater understanding on both sides. In the meantime, so far as the Reserve Bank of India is concerned, we will continue to play by the extant rules of the game.   9.  Central banks have to interact closely with financial markets for transmission of monetary policy impulses. In this context, ensuring a sound and efficient payment and settlement system is a pre- requisite. Taking cognisance of  exponential  growth of digiti sation  and online commerce in India, policy efforts have been directed in recent years to put in place a state of the art national payments infrastructure and technology platform. This has changed the retail payments scenario of the country. R egulation and development of our payment system envisages the objectives of 6  safety, security, convenience, accessibility, and leveraging technological solutions to enable faster processing.  In order to ensure an orderly development of FinTechs  and streamline their infl uence into the financial system , we are now  working on guideline s to introduce a 'regulatory sandbox/innovation hub' within a well -defined space and duration to experiment with FinTech solutions.   10. In this high flux and uncertain environment, EMEs  could perhaps be better  off by stepping up cooperation on all fronts, while recogni sing multi -polarity. One area of cooperation could be to put in place an institutional mechanism which balances the concerns of both oil exporting and importing countries to ensure stability in energy prices.  EMEs also need to explore alternatives to reduce dependence on conventional  energy sources, and give greater focus on renewables and energy efficiency.  The International Solar Alliance, with its headquarters in New Delhi, is a vivid example. It seeks to provide a dedicated platform for cooperation among financia l and solar resource rich countries so that the global community benefits from the use of solar energy.   11. In closing, let me  say a few words  about India. Real GDP growth is expected to clock 7.2  per cent  during 2019 -20, the fastest among large economies of the world, growing by a n average rate of around 7.5 per cent in recent years . Inflation has remained below target, averaging 3.6 per cent for the period under the inflation targeting framework so far (since October  2016 up to February 2019) ; the current account deficit is expected to be  around 2 .5 per cent of GDP in 2018- 19; and the gross fiscal deficit has adhered to budgetary targets.   7  12. Looking ahead, our priority is to remain watchful and take coordinated action to revive growth and maintain macroeconomic,  financial  and price  stability.  Thank you.

Introduction 1.1 Capital markets play  a crucial role in the economic development of a  country. They provide financial resources required for the long- term sustainable development of the economy.  Development of viable capital market s is therefore considered an important element in the macro -financial policy toolkit, including for objectives such as financial sta bility and  the transmission of monetary policy.  1.2 The Committee on Global Financial System  (CGFS) , which meets at  the Bank for International Settlements  (BIS) , constituted a Working Group in 2018- 19 to examine  global  trends in capital market development , identify various factors (legal, institutional, structural and conjunctural) that foster the development of robust capital markets , and consider the role of policy including prudential measures . The Working Group,  co-chaired by the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC, Dr. Li Bo) and the Reser ve Bank of India (RBI, D r. Viral V. Acharya) , focussed on issues primarily related to the development of markets in bond and equity securities2. While these issues  are arguably of greater relevance to emerging market economies , they were found to be of significant interest even for advanced economies.   1.3 The CGFS Report identified the drivers  of capital market development and categorised them into two types :  (i) drivers which  create an enabling environment  for financial development , and  (ii) drivers which  are more capital market specific .                                                              1 These remarks collectively summarise the presentations made earlier at the RBI symposium on Establishing Viable Capital Markets, 29 May 2019; the Institute for Indian Economic Studies (IIES), Tokyo, Japan, 10 June 2019; the meeting with Foreign Portfolio Investors, Tokyo, Japan, 11 June 2019; the National University of Singapore (NUS) Asian Leaders in Financial Institutions (ALFI) Programme, Bengaluru, 20 June 2019, and Fireside Chat at the Indian School of Business, Hyderabad, 29 June 2019.   2  The Report was delivered to the CGFS at the BIS meeting on 23 January 2019 and is available at  https://www.bis.org/publ/cgfs62.pdf     2  1.4 Drivers which create an enabling environment  as identified in the CGFS Report include :  \u2013 macroeconomic stability,  \u2013 broad respect for market autonomy,  \u2013 fair and efficient legal and judicial systems , and  \u2013 an efficient regulatory regime that creates conditions favourable for financial contracts.   1.5 Drivers which are capital market specific as  identified in the CGFS Report include : \u2013 easy access to high- quality material information,  \u2013 diversity in the investor base,  \u2013 efficient market ecosystem for trading and robust market infrastructures , \u2013 openness towards international investor s while maintaining macro -economic  stability , and \u2013 markets for hedging and funding securities .  1.6 The CGFS Report made six broad policy recommendations :  (i) promoting greater market autonomy;  (ii) strengthening legal and judicial systems for investor protection;  (iii) enhancing regulatory independence and effectiveness;  (iv) increasing the depth and diversity of the domestic institutional investor base;   (v) opening up capital market s internationally in a bi -directional manner ; and  (vi) developing complementary markets for derivative s, repo transactions and securities lending.   1.7 Policy initiatives in India ha ve been largely in sync with the findings and recommendations  of the CGFS Report . I shall discuss these and future policy directions after providing a brief overview of the Indian capital markets.  While the scope of the CGFS Report is the entire capital market,  I will largely con fine this speech to the markets regulated by the Reserve Bank, viz ., interest rate  markets and (to a lesser  extent)  foreign exc hange markets.    3  2. Overview of the Indian capital markets 2.1 Indian capital market s have  a history of more than a century . However, they remained largely  inactive till the 1970s . Partial liberalis ation of the economy and pro-capital market policies  during the 1980s infused some life into the markets, but it was only the economic liberalisation of the 1990s that provided a lasting impetus . Today , segments of India\u2019s  capital market s are comparable with counterparts in many of the advanced economies in terms of efficiency (price discovery), tradability (low impact cost), resilience (co- movement of rates across product classes and yield curves), and stability . In particular, their  ability to withstand several  periods of s tress , notably  the Asian financial crisis  in 1997 -98, the global financial crisis  in 2007- 09 and the \u201ctaper tantrum \u201d episode in 2013,  is a sign of their increasing maturity .  2.2 In terms of size, all the major  segments of the capital market , viz., Central Government securities (G -Sec) market , market for State Development Loans  (SDL) , corporate bond market and equity market  \u2013\u2013 the so called \u201ccash market s\u201d \u2013\u2013 have experienced consistent growth during the past few decades in terms of primary issuance, market capitalisation (for equity market) and trading volume s in the secondary market . Equity market remains the largest segment , even as G -Sec, SDL and corporate bond markets have grown steadily  (Chart 1) .

In the primary G -Sec market s, issuances are made as per a half -yearly pre-announced calendar . The calendar specifies the amount, tenor and issuance dates. The tenor of the G -Secs goes up to 40 years. G -Secs are mostly fixed -coupon bonds, although instruments such as inflation- linked bonds, capital -indexed bonds, floating- rate bonds and bonds with embedded options  are also issued. Currently, all issuance s are done through weekly auctions. Issuances are supported by Primary Dealers (PDs) who fully underwrite the issue. Auctions are conducted through both competitive bidding [ for all residents, Foreign Portfolio Investors ( FPIs) and Non-Resident Indians ( NRIs) ], which determines the market -clearing price , and non -competitive bidding (for retail investors, largely ), which receives the allotted securities at  the market -clearing price. More than 90% of the issuances are done through re- opening of existing securities  which has contributed significantly to market liquidity by spreading out ownership across a large number of investors . The Reserve Bank has  also i ntroduced \u201cwhen -issued\u201d segment for the G-Sec market since 20063.  The profile of both G -Secs and SDLs  in terms of stock and flow characteristics is  shown in Tables  1 and 2.  The weighted average coupon on G -Secs has remained stable across interest rate cycles imparting stability to the debt profile as the average maturity of issuance (more than 10 years) is one of the longest globally, helping limit  the rollover risk for the central government . SDL issuance has increasingly formed a much greater share of issuance relative to the G -Secs , rising  from around 25% of issuance in 2013- 14 to around 45% in 2017- 18.                                                               3. \u2018When Issued\u2019, a short form of 'when, as and if issued ', indicates  a conditional transaction in a security authorized for issuance but not as yet actually issued. All 'when issued' transactions are on an 'if' basis, to be settled if and when the actual security is issued. Such trading facilitates the distribution process  for Government securities by stretching the actual distribution period for each issue and allowing the market more time to absorb large issues without disruption.    5  Table 1: Characteristics  of Central Government borrowings  (G-Secs)  Year  Issued during the Year  Outstanding stock   Weighted Average  Yield (%)  Weighted Average Maturity (years)  Weighted Average Coupon (%)  Weighted  Average Maturity  (years)  2013 -14 8.4 14.2 8.0 10.0 2014 -15 8.5 14.7 8.1 10.2 2015 -16 7.9 16.0 8.1 10.5 2016 -17 7.2 14.8 8.0 10.7 2017 -18 7.0 15.0 8.0 10.7 2018 -19 7.8 14.7  7.8 10.4  Source: Annual Report of Reserve Bank of India (2017- 18) and Database of Indian Economy  (DBIE) , Reserve Bank of India  Table 2: Issuance profile of Government borrowings  (in US $ billion)  Year  Central Government  (G-Secs) State Governments  (SDLs) Gross issuance  Outstanding stock at (end-March)  Gross issuance  Outstanding stock at (end-March)  2013 -14    90 609 31 174 2014 -15    91 648 36 199 2015 -16    85 674 41 243 2016 -17    80 754 56 321 2017 -18    91 795 63 346 2018 -19 83 837 70 404 Source: Database of Indian Economy  (DBIE) , Reserve Bank of India  2.4 Liquidity of the G -Sec market:  Liquidity  in the secondary market for government securities has  noticeably improved over the past decade (Chart 2) . The average daily volume in the G-Sec and SDL markets has remained higher than that   6  of corporate bond and equity cash market s. The liquidity in G -Secs is, however,  mainly concentrated in a few benchmark securities, particularly the 10- year benchmark , and SDLs are relatively less liquid than the G -Secs, yielding typically 50 -75 basis points more than the G-Secs in terms of yield at the 10- year tenor. The average bid- ask spread for liquid securities in the G-Sec market has remained less than a basis point during the last few years  (Chart 3 ). Strikingly, bid-ask spread as well as the price impact of trade for the 10 year Indian G -Sec benchmark are comparable to or lower than those for most of the advanced economies of the world including the US, the UK, France and Germany (Chart 4 ).  Chart 2: Secondary market liquidity in terms of average daily volume  Source: Clearing Corporation of India Limited (C CIL), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)  There are several proximate drivers of this liquidity of the Indian G -Sec market:  (i) Regular issuance of the 10- year benchmark has concentrated trading interest in this segment of the yield curve. Efforts are now being made to regularise issuance of benc hmark securities at shorter maturities (2 and 5 years).  (ii) Secondary market transactions are predominantly  (around 80%)  conducted in an anonymous electronic order matching system (NDS -OM) which is unique in the world  for debt trading .

(iii) Near real -time dissemination of trade information publicly accessible on the website of the Clearing Corporation of India ( CCIL ) ensures price transparency.   (iv) Settlement is guaranteed by  the CCIL and takes place through Delivery versus Payment ( DvP)  mechanism on T+1 basis. Guaranteed settlement implies there is no risk to investors from each other of delivery failures.  (v) Finally, enabling of short -selling facilitate s a two-way interest adding to activity and price discovery in the market .

Is suances are predominantly through private placement and dominated by high credit issuers. In 2018- 19, 79% of the issuances we re by  entities rated \u2018A\u2019 or higher . Secondary market trading has also picked up in the recent past, with trading volumes rising from USD 170 billion in FY 2014- 15 to USD 267 billion in 2018- 19. Trading is entirely OTC  with trades settled bilaterally and reported to stock exchanges.                                                              4 Negotiated Dealing System -Order Matching.   0.2618 0.6489  0.00000.20000.40000.60000.80001.00001.2000Apr/15Jun/15Aug/15Oct/15Dec/15Feb/16Apr/16Jun/16Aug/16Oct/16Dec/16Feb/17Apr/17Jun/17Aug/17Oct/17Dec/17Feb/18Apr/18Jun/18Aug/18Oct/18Dec/18Feb/19Apr/19Basis points    8  Chart 4: 10 -year benchmark G -Sec liquidity in different countries               2.6 Recent developments in the corporate bond market:  Consistent investment interest by domestic institutions like mutual funds, pension funds and insurance funds as well as foreign portfolio investors  (FPIs) has helped in developing the corporate bond market .  Tri-party r epo (\u201csale and repurchase\u201d)  in corporate bond s has been introduced by the exchanges  recently with a view to encourage trading interest. Implementation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) starting December 2016 is expected to go a long way  in improving  participation in the corporate bond market  by strengthening the protection of creditor rights, in a market presently characterised by one of the lowest recovery rates (25%) in the world (Chart 5). With greater confidence in time- bound and efficient resolutions under the IBC, foreign investors are likely to  explore investment in sub- investment grade and distressed corporate assets .   020406080010203040ID TR MY NO CN MX TH IT JP KR BR ZA FR AU DE CA US GB IN    2 1 Average of daily bid- ask spreads in May 2018, defined as: (ask price \u2013 bid price) / bid price * 100, i.e., the return cost of executing a round -trip transaction in the bond.    2 Based on USD 10 million transaction amount using estimates from the Bloomberg Liquidity Assessment (LQA) function, Jun 2018.

The investor base for G -Secs, for instance,  has expanded over the past decade in terms of an increase in the share of holdings by  insurance companies and corporates and a corresponding decrease in the share of holding by commercial banks ( Chart 6). In parallel, c alibrated access for global investors through the FPI route is helping broaden the investor base, while also bring ing in diversity of trading views and strategies.          10  Chart 6: Holding pattern for  Government Securities  (% held by each investor group)   Source: Database of Indian Economy  (DBIE) , Reserve Bank of India    2.8 Funding and Derivatives Market s: A necessary condition for the development of capital market s is the existence of funding and securities lending markets as well as derivative markets for risk transfer.

Policy initiat ives in India  What has enabled the growth of Indian capital markets to reach this stage? To answer this, I will now discuss the policy measures taken in India vis -\u00e0-vis the findings and recommendations of the CGFS Report . 3.1 Enabling environment  3.1.1 Macroeconomic Stability  India\u2019s GDP growth has been one of the highest among large economies during the last decade and half (Chart 8 ). Double digit inflation of few years prior to the \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d episode has been tamed,  facilitated by a shift  by the Reserve Bank  in 2016                                                             5 An Overnight Index Swap (OIS) is an interest rate swap agreement where a fixed rate is swapped against a pre -determined published index of a daily overnight reference rate for an agreed period.  6 Triparty repo in G- Secs  went live on November 0 5, 2018. In tri-party repo, a third party acts as a central counter party between the two originating parties of a rep o transaction. Currently, the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. ( CCIL ) acts as the \u201ct riparty agent \u201d for the G -Secs, while the Bombay Stock Exchange ( BSE) and the National Stock Exchange ( NSE) operate as t riparty agents for c orporate bonds . 16 25 0.00 0.07 0.000.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.08051015202530FY 09-10FY 10-11FY 11-12FY 12-13FY 13-14FY 14-15FY 15-16FY 16-17FY 17-18FY 18-19USD billion  USD billion  Repo/TREPS* in G-Sec Corporate Bond repo (RHS)  12  to flexible inflation targeting with a headline target of 4%  (+/- 2%) for the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) . High levels of inflation make holdings of financial assets economically unattractive relative to non- financial assets such as housing and gold. The important reform of flexible inflation targeting, helped by low  oil price s and food supply management,  has kept the headline inflation under control  during the last 5 years , relative to the MPC\u2019s mandated target (Chart 9). This way, two precondition s of macroeconomic stability  \u2013\u2013 stable growth and low inflation \u2013\u2013 necessary  for financialisation of savings and capital market development are now in place in India.

Rationalising regulatory guidelines and procedures In active coordination with the government and other financial market regulators , the Reserve Bank  has undertaken a series of reforms and rationalisation of existing policies. These measures also seek to ensure financial stability and instil confidence among stakeholders.  Some i mportant examples include:   (i) Liberalising the process for innovation of new products ; (ii) Moving away from a prescriptive approach to a principle- based regulatory approach;  (iii) Minimising interference in the market process by eschewing ad- hoc \u2018approval s\u2019; and, (iv) Attempting to achieve comprehensive market regulations by addressing gaps , in particular,  by issuing market abuse regulations  and benchmark regulations , as well as  regulating trading platforms.    6.6%  [VALUE] % [VALUE] %  - 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 12.0 14.0 16.0 18.0Apr/07Oct/07Apr/08Oct/08Apr/09Oct/09Apr/10Oct/10Apr/11Oct/11Apr/12Oct/12Apr/13Oct/13Apr/14Oct/14Apr/15Oct/15Apr/16Oct/16Apr/17Oct/17Apr/18Oct/18Apr/19Percent    14  b. Development of financial market institutions and infrastructure A well- developed and reliable infrastructure is a prerequisite for safe and efficient functioning of financial market s. Acknowledging this principle, the Reserve Bank has taken several steps  to put in place an effective infrastructure in the markets it regulates , the salient steps being:  (i) Introduction of an anonymous trading platform for G -Sec called the Negotiated Dealing System -Order Matching (NDS- OM);  (ii) Introduction of  Legal Entity Identifier code (LEI) for OTC derivatives market s as well as non- derivatives market s; (iii) Development of a foreign exchange trading platform  (Fx-Retail) aimed at bringing down transactions costs for retail users  (August 2019) ; and,  (iv) Constituting an independent financial benchmark administrator,  viz., the Financial Benchmarks of India Ltd. (FBIL) .   c. Macro- prudential management  of investment restrictions for domestic and foreign investors It has been a constant endeavour of the Reserve Bank to rationalise, and wherever consistent w ith macro -prudential objectives , to relax  restrictions in the form of investment limits imposed on the market participants :  (i) The Reserve Bank has reduced the Statutory Liquidity Requirement (SLR) stipulation  on the minimum percentage of Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL)  to be held in G -Secs and SDLs by banks in a calibrated way (Chart 10) from close to 40% in 1990 to below 20% at present. This important relaxation has resulted in a  greater flexibility for banks in their investment decisions and added to the diversity of investor base in G-Secs and SDLs (Chart 6) \u2013\u2013  which , in turn , have aided efficient pricing of these  bonds.         15  Chart 10: Reduction in the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) investment for banks    Source: Database of Indian Economy (DBIE) , Reserve Bank of India   (ii) The Reserve Bank has been calibrating access for Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI s) in debt market s to provide them greater latitude in managing their portfolios in terms of increased FPI investment limits  (Charts 11 and 12) as well as  expanded eligibility of  instruments  and tenor  for FPI investments .  (iii) Recently, t he Reserve Bank has introduced the Voluntary Retention Route (VRR) scheme  to relax the macro -prudential restrictions for FPIs t hat are willing to retain a significant portion of their investments in the country for a minimum retention period (presently three years) .

In India, the Public Debt Act  (1944) , the Securities Contract Regulation Act  (1956) and the Government Securities Act  (2006)  govern the 10 27 13 49 0510152025303540455001/03/201201/07/201201/11/201201/03/201301/07/201301/11/201301/03/201401/07/201401/11/201401/03/201501/07/201501/11/201501/03/201601/07/201601/11/201601/03/201701/07/201701/11/201701/03/201801/07/201801/11/201801/03/2019USD billion  FPI investment Upper limit19 31 41 44 051015202530354045502012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019USD billion  FPI investment Upper limit  17  formalisation of issuance and transfer of securities. In parallel, t he Reserve Bank of India Act (1934)  confers power s on the Reserve Bank to regulate money , derivatives, repo and government secur ities market s. With the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) (December 2016) , the legal framework for financial regulation  is also moving closer to being comprehensive and effective in the context of non- financial corporate borrowers . However, the lack of resolution framework for non-bank financial entities remains a crucial gap that deserves prompt attention of the authorities.   3.2 Capital m arket  specific drivers Let me now turn to some of the other important drivers of market development in India and also highlight some critical areas for improvement.  3.2.1 Disclosure regime As per the cross -country survey findings of the CGFS Report, proper and timely disclosure by the issuers in corporate bond market is a prerequisite for gaining investors\u2019 confidence in this  market. Conversely, lack of adequate disclosures raises the financing costs of corporates , especially sub- investment grade ones, and keeps the capital markets small. Recognising this, regulators in India have emphasised and mandated high quality and timely disclosures by issuers.  However, a few instances of recent default s in commercial paper and corporate bond market s have raised concerns about the quality of disclosures, even for  investment -grade firms . These concerns are worthy of careful scrutiny and assessment relative to the best international practices to help fine-tune standards for the timely disclosure of default -relevant information by corporates.   3.2.2 Deepening the domestic institutional base Expanding the investor base leads to increasing diversity in the market  (see section 2.7). Efforts in this direction need to be sustained, with  a particular focus on the domestic institutional investor base. Improving pension and insurance coverage for households can be a priority as it not only leads to social welfare outcomes , but also leads to a stronger and more stable investor base for capital markets . Better financialisation of household savings could be a catalyst for retail participation in   18  markets , in turn providing a boost to collective investment vehicles such as mutual funds  and alternative investment funds (AIFs) . 3.2.3 Bi-directional opening of markets to international participation One of the key drivers of market development  recognised in the CGFS Report  is opening up of the market to foreign participants although it entails managing global spillover risk s. The Reserve Bank has taken calibrated steps in opening up its regulated market s to foreign participants as discussed ear lier and also allow ed domestic players to participate in overseas market s:  (i) In consultation with the government, the Reserve Bank has decided to permit offshore trading and settlement of G -Secs through International Central Securities Depositories (ICSD) for non- residents who do not want to undergo the domestic FPI registration procedure.    (ii) The recently issued draft of regulations for hedging currency risk embodies many of the drivers identified by the CGFS report \u2013\u2013  product innovation, opening up markets to non- residents and simplified  hedging guidelines  which offer greater flexibility to users .   (iii) Similarly , in March 2018, the Reserve Bank freed up overseas hedging by residents of commodity price risk and freight risk overseas . Residents were permitted to hedge both direct and indirect commodity risk  through specified instruments . For direct exposure,  all price risk on all commodities is now permitted to be hedged  overseas,  while for indirect  exposure,  residents can hedge overseas the price risk on industrial metals only. Further, revised directions treat risks acquired from domestic and cross -border transactions at par.  To manage the global spillover risk s arising from such reforms , prudenti al limits have been in place alongside most of these reforms to ensure consistency with the overall state of capital account liberalisation for India  and anchor macro- prudential risks at manageable levels.       19   3.2.4 Developing complementary markets  Deep and liquid complementary market s like repo and derivatives play a crucial role in the growth of the cash market s as they help investors in funding and hedging.  Over the past few years, the Reserve Bank  has taken measures to help develop repo markets for both Government securities and corporate bonds. Introduction of tr i-party repo (August 2017) has been a success for the G-Sec market ; however, tri -party repo is yet to pick up in the corporate bond market. Similarly, securities lending  (\u201cmarket repo\u201d) work s well for G -Secs although wider participation (especially by large holders of G -Secs like mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds ) is required to avoid occasional episodes of excessive volatility in borrowing costs. All these regulatory measur es have resulted in a consistent growth in liquidity in the repo markets . To boost derivatives  markets, efforts are required in encouraging better risk management by domestic institutions, especially banks. With the untapped interest rate derivatives market set for a pickup in the risk management activity of banks and non-banks , the role of complementary markets will strengthen in the years to follow.   3.3 Other recent initiatives Let me conclude by enumerating four of the important initiatives underway to develop Indian capital markets further:  a. Task Force on Offshore Rupee Markets The Reserve Bank constituted a Task Force in February 2019  to examine in depth  issues relating to the offshore Rupee m arkets and recommend appropriate policy measures  to align incentives for non- residents to gradually move to the domestic market for their hedging requirements and also to ensure the stability of the external value of the Rupee. The Report of the Task Force is due by mid -July 2019.  b. Internal Working Group on Market Timings  The Reserve Bank has set up an I nternal Working Group on Market Timings which will comprehensively review the timings of various markets that are under the purview of the Reserve Bank , and will assess the necessary payment and settlement   20  infrastructure that can support co- ordinated timings across these markets.  The Working Group\u2019s Report , after submission, will be released for public feedback.   c. Task Force on the Development of Secondary Market for Corporate Loans  The Reserve Bank  has constituted a T ask Force on the D evelopment of  Secondary Market  for Corporate Loans. It will suggest required policies for facilitating the development of a secondary market in corporate loans, including loan transaction platform for stressed assets, creation of a loan contract registry, its ownership structure and related protocols such as the standardization of loan information, independent validation and data access.  The Report of the Task Force is due by  the end of  August  2019.  d. Committee on the Development of Housing Finance Securitisation Market  The Reserve Bank constituted this committee to assess the state of housing finance securitisation markets in India; study the best international practices as well as lessons learnt from the global financial crisis; and propose measures to further develop these markets in India by identifying critical s teps required such as, inter alia, definition of conforming mortgages, mortgage documentation standards, digital registry for ease of due diligence and verification by investors, avenues for trading in securitised assets, etc.  The Report of the Committee i s due by the end of August 2019.  In summary, it should be clear that  while Indian capital markets have evolved steadily to a stage of long- run viability , the potential for  developing and strengthening them  further  is limitless \u2026  \u201cLet us, then, be up and doing,  With a heart for any fate;  Still achieving, still pursuing,  Learn to labou r and to wait. \u201d \u2013\u2013 A Psalm of Life by  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow   (1807\u2013 1882)  ", "24 Feb 10 MP.pdf": "Welcome Remarks by Governor  L. K. Jha Memorial Lectur e by Prof. John B. Taylor Lessons from the Financial Crisis for  Monetary Policy in Emerging Markets  February 24, 2010 ______________________________ __________________________   On behalf of the Reserve Bank of India,  I have great pleasure in welcoming Prof. John Brian Taylor who will shortly be delivering the L. K. Jha Memorial Lecture. We are very ha ppy to welcome also Ms. Ra ye Allyn Taylor who has accompanied Prof. Taylor. I also want to acknowledge the family members of late Dr. L.K. Jha - Smt. Dipika Maharaj Singh, Smt. and Shri. Aditya Maharaj Singh, Trisha Maharaj Singh. Many thanks to all of you for rejoining the RBI family. And of course, a hearty welcome to all our invi tees who have made the time to come for this lecture. This year\u2019s L.K. Jha Memo rial Lecture has special significance as it forms part of the Platinum Jubilee celebrations of the Reserve Bank.    2. Dr. Lakshmi Kant Jha was an outst anding economist and a distinguished civil servant. A member of the ICS, he  was Governor of the Reserve Bank from July 1967 to May 1970. Prior to his appointment as Governor, Dr. Jha served as secretary to the Prime Minister. He headed the Reserve Bank during one of the most challenging phases of the Indian economy. The country was shaken by food \u00a0\u00a02security concerns, and initiatives to redre ss this eventually resulted in the much celebrated \u2018Green Revolution\u2019. The Reserve Bank, under Dr. Jha, was an influential force in shaping these initiatives. The overall scarcity situation renewed the urgency for focusing public policy towards poverty reduction. This led to several path breaking policies, including the nati onalization of fourteen major commercial banks in 1969 on Dr. Jha\u2019s watch. Subsequent ly, he served as India\u2019s Ambassador to the United States and as Governor of  Jammu and Kashmir. Dr. Jha was also member of the Brandt Commission. In r ecognition of Dr. Jha\u2019s extraordinary services to the Reserve Bank and to the na tion, the Reserve Bank of India instituted this lecture series in 1990. So far, there have been 10 lectures, and the lecture by Professor Taylor this evening will be the 11th in the series.   3. It is perhaps presumptuous to intro duce Prof. Taylor, especially since his views and writings have been so central to shaping the debate on the resolution of the crisis that we have just gone through. Regardless, I will indulge in the pleasure of introducing Prof. Taylor, if also  because the occasion demands it.   4. Prof. John Taylor is presently the Mary and Robert Raymond Professor of Economics at Stanford University. Prof. Taylor has straddled a wide academic canvas and is famous for his work on th e development of rational expectation models with staggered wage  setting, the design of monetary policy rules for the conduct of economic policy and inte rnational policy co-ordination.   5. Prof. Taylor\u2019s writings have had a profound impact on policy making particularly in the area of monetary polic y. He has contributed to the development \u00a0\u00a03of mathematical methods for solving m acroeconomic models under the assumption of rational expectations. In 1977, Prof. Taylor and Edmund Phelps, simultaneously with Stanley Fischer, show ed that monetary policy is  useful for stabilizing an economy if wages are sticky, even when all workers and firms have rational expectations. This was insightful and path breaking research as it demonstrated that the theory of rational expect ations was not inconsistent with Keynesian economics.   6. In the academia, reputations are built  on pushing the frontiers of knowledge. A common metric for this is the quant um and quality of publications. But the ultimate recognition for an academic is to enter text books, and quite understandably very few make it. Prof. Ta ylor is among those select few, and the celebrated Taylor rule, that he propounde d in 1992, is now part of standard macroeconomic text books.   7. The Taylor rule is a simple equation to describe the response of the Fed\u2019s interest rate target to inflation and business cycles. The equation succeeded in serving both as a descrip tion and as a prescription: it described how the Fed had been setting its inte rest rate target and prescrib ed what the Fe d ought to - and indeed might - do next. The equation quickly gained wi de acceptance among central banks as a useful guide for polic y.  Viewed as a prescription, the equation says that a central bank ought to raise the ta rget interest rate a bove its neutral level when inflation is above the central bank\u2019 s (explicit or implicit) target, or when output is above potential. In short, the e quation requires of central banks to \u201clean against the wind.\u201d The equation also embodi es what has come to be known as the \u00a0\u00a04Taylor principle: that a central bank shoul d respond to an increas e in inflation with a more-than-proportional increase in  the policy interest rate.   8. Monetary policy has embraced the Taylor Rule so firmly that there has been an intense debate in the wake of the crisis on the policy stance of the US Fed vis-\u00e0-vis the Taylor rule. Some analysts used th e Taylor Rule to argue that the Fed funds rate, even at this historically low leve l, was not low enough and made out a case for doing a lot more to stimulate the economy. Prof. Taylor himself weighed in on the issue suggesting that those analysts we re not applying his rule correctly. He contended that, quite to the contrary, hi s measure shows just the opposite: that the Fed policy is appropriate, the policy rate  cannot remain low for too long, that central bankers are right to be consid ering withdrawal of their unprecedented monetary stimulus, and that critics who sa y otherwise are misint erpreting his rule. According to him, the formula is designed to  show the best rate  for spurring growth without stoking inflation.   9. If the Taylor rule is so time tested in  prescribing the policy interest rate, it is legitimate to ask what role there is left for central bankers. I do not have a simple answer for this; perhaps Prof. Taylor doe s. I do have a complex and somewhat longish answer and here it is.  10. For my long and complex answer, it is necessary to refer to the interesting debate on whether economics can be a deterministic and exact science like physics. Indeed, some people argue that one of the great follies of economics - the reason it often lost direction, if also  credibility is because it ha d pretense to being like \u00a0\u00a05physics. I have no intention of getting into  that debate, but in the context of the Taylor rule, I can\u2019t resist the temp tation of drawing upon a comparison of economics with physics, if at an altogether different level.   11. Sir Issac Newton gave us the three la ws of motion and the law of gravity. The mathematical formulation of these laws  embodies a complete  description of the universe. All you need to specify are th e initial conditions and using Newton\u2019s laws, you can calculate the state of the universe for eternity with absolute determinism. This is classical Cartesian reductionist framework in its quintessence.  People, therefore, asked, if God has deci ded on the laws and decided on the initial conditions, he has determined the course of  the universe for eternity. Besides, he gave us Newton to let us know of the laws so that we can estimate the course of the universe with immutable precision. After he  has performed his initial and only task, what need then for God, a question that Stephen Hawking poses powerfully in his \u2018Brief History of Time\u2019?   12. In a similar vein, it is possible to ask, if the Taylor  rule is so deterministic, and monetary policy is just a question of  plugging in numbers into an equation, and using the results for the policy, what need then for central banks?  13. Here again, I suppose, the analogy with physics will help. Even though Newtonian mechanics held intellectual sw ay for nearly 250 years, we now know that the physical universe is not as deterministic as implied by Newton\u2019s laws. Newtonian physics does not work at the extremely small scale where we need quantum mechanics and at the extremely la rge scale where we need the relativity \u00a0\u00a06theory. So, Newtonian physics works a nd works effectively as a very good approximation for understanding the known unive rse. At the extrem es, we need the sophistication of quantum m echanics or relativistic mechanics. Similarly, the Taylor rule, I believe, gives us a basis for determining the monetary policy stance, but central banks need to superimpose th eir judgement in applying it to practical policy.   14. Prof. Taylor will be speaking to us today on \u2018Lessons from the Financial Crisis for Monetary Policy in Emerging Markets\u2019. Frankly, he could not have chosen a more relevant topic. The m onetary policy challenges of emerging economies are clearly quite distinct from  those of advanced economics. But we tend to forget this. During the crisis, for example, there was quite a bit of pressure on us to do everything that advanced  economy central banks were doing notwithstanding the fact that  our situation was different in many respects. Of course, the decoupling theory did not work and all emerging economies were impacted by the crisis, although to different  extents. But our banks and financial institutions did not have significant exposure to sub-prime assets and therefore were not threatened by illiquidi ty or insolvency. Even at th e height of the crisis, our financial markets continued to function normally. Our concern was not so much rescuing a collapsing financial sector but  rather arresting the moderation in economic growth. Second, we never had a f ear of deflation although WPI inflation was negative for a short period; in fact, in flation has been and continues to be our dominant concern. Third, in advanced ec onomies, the crisis spread from the financial sector to the real sector whereas in emerging economies, the direction was \u00a0\u00a07the reverse - the fault lines spread from the real sector to the financial sector. Finally, much of our pressures came from the supply side, not the demand side. For all these reasons and more, the challenges we faced were different and the responses called for from us had to be differe nt. It is important for us as well as the rest of the world to appreciate these di fferences between a dvanced and emerging economies. What better person than Prof. Taylor to look at monetary policy responses from the special pers pective of emerging economies?  15. Prof. Taylor\u2019s career has been marked by a seamless back-and-forth between the academia and policymaking, most  recently as the U.S. Treasury\u2019s top official for international affairs. When in academia, he jumps into teaching and research with an abandon that seems uncha racteristic of a Washington policymaker. To grab students\u2019 attenti on in a class on agricultural  supply and demand, he once pranced around the classroom in  a California raisin costum e to the tune of Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cI heard it through the Grapevine.\u201d  16. Having a concept named after onesel f is as much a mark of honor in economics as it is in other sciences. By this standard, Prof. Taylor is among the most honoured macroeconomists of his ge neration. Indeed, concepts bearing his name have become so pervasive that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke once remarked that \u201cwith our  appetites whetted by the Taylor rule, the [Taylor] principle, and the [Taylor] curve, we now look forward to the Taylor dictum, the Taylor hyperbola, and ma ybe even the Taylor conundrum.\u201d   \u00a0\u00a0817. Here in Mumbai, and in a more imme diate sense, we look forward to the Taylor lecture.   18. Ladies and gentlemen, I have great pl easure in inviting Prof. Taylor to deliver the 11th L.K. Jha Memorial Lecture. ", "4 Jan 10 MP.pdf": "Page  | 1                                                  Financial Markets \u2013 Some Regulato ry Issues and Recent Developments Shyamala Gopinath (Inaugural address at the FIMMDA-PDAI A nnual Conference, January 4, 2010, Mumbai) 1. It is my pleasure to be here today again, at  the FIMMDA-PDAI annual c onference as we enter into a new decade. The last decade in the Indian  financial sector has been a forward continuum marked by significant developments. It was in 1999 that guidelines for interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements were first introduced. 1999 was also the year when FEMA was enacted and since then it has been a process of measured  opening up of the capital account. That was also the time when the LAF framework for modulating short term liquidity wa s introduced and a plan was put in place for making uncollateralized ca ll money market as a pure inter-bank market. Looking back, we have come along a long way. One thing that perhaps connects through the regulatory approach during this period has been the pursuit of financial stability. Some may be surprised to note that as far back  as the start of this decade, th e conceptualization of financial stability had been ingrained into the macro- economic and policy framework of the RBI. There was a stated focus on the need to treat financial stabi lity as a dominant objective of macroeconomic management and as a necessary, if not the sufficient, condition for accelerating economic growth1. Financial stability, of course, has acq uired its rightful pl ace as a key policy objective globally since the onset of crisis. 2. In my address last year, I had touched upon some of the burni ng issues that the global policy makers were grappling with. The financial markets have since stabilised a nd there is recovery in risk appetite but this primarily reflects the unprecedented and extraordinary policy measures taken by central ba nks and governments. Public sector assu med the role of not only the lender but also the risk taker of last resort. Much water has flown in the interregnum and in terms of outcomes, at the very least, we have a comm on minimum globally agreed program for repairing the financial system. The key elements of this pr ogram are: a strengthened capital adequacy  and liquidity regime for banks, developing a framework for system ically important entities and resolution arrangements, extending the regulator y perimeter to unregulated pools of money, de-risking the OTC derivatives trad ing and new frameworks for regul ating compensation within the financial sector. The main action on the above progr am is primarily concentrated on both sides of the Atlantic for obvious reasons. However, most of the other countries, including India, have agreed to the broad commitments bei ng driven by the G20 and the FSB.  3. My address today will be in two parts. In the first part I propose to discuss broad issues relating to financial market regulation and in the second part will briefly review the key developments in major markets in I ndia and certain unsettled issues.  I. Regulatory approach for markets 4. In the post crisis scenario, the new important variable that is being sought to be addressed globally is the oversight of systemic risk. It is  being acknowledged that institutional regulation alone is not sufficient in capturing and addressing systemic risks and it is imperative to have a  1 RBI Annual Report 1999-2000 Page  | 2                                                  mechanism to monitor and act upon the risks inherent in the interc onnectedness across the financial system \u2013 a macro-prudential approach to re gulation and supervisi on. It is recognized that systemic risk is created endogeneously rather than having exogeneous origins beyond the remit of financial markets.   Macro-prudential regulation \u2013 The Concept 5. Macroprudential approach, generically, can be de fined as policy that focuses on the financial system as a whole, and also treats aggregate risk as endogenous with regard to collective behaviour of institutions. It aims to limit syst em wide distress so as to avoid output costs associated with financial instability2. The underlying philosophy of m acro-prudential regulation is that behind the individual prudence of fina ncial firms may underlie systemic problems caused by their collective behavior. A recen t Bank of England discussion paper3 interprets macroprudential policy as lying on a spectru m with monetary policy at one end and microprudential policy at the other,  concerned with the stability of the aggregate provision of financial intermediation services to the real economy.     6. The two key elements of macro-prudential regulation4 that have acquired maximum attention are one, existence of common (correlated) exposures which arise either because institutions are directly exposed to the same or similar asset cla sses or because of indirect exposures associated with linkages among them (e.g. counterparty re lationships) and two, co llective homogeneous actions on the part of institutions resultin g in amplification of risks because of interconnectedness, the pro-cyclicality element.   7. Integral to the above approach  is also the role of financial markets \u2013 by and in themselves, different market segments, assessed in terms of th e usual metrics such as liquidity, turnover, etc. may be functioning absolutely well, but there may still be underlying systemic vulnerabilities arising out of the interactions of different ma rket participants, both regulated as well as unregulated, across different markets.   8. However, there is still no c oherent framework emerging for re gulation of financial markets from a stability perspective. Indeed, the join t IMF-BIS-FSB paper on assessing the Systemic Importance of Financial Institutions, Markets and Instruments also acknowledges that the assessment of systemic importance of markets pr esents more conceptual challenges than for institutions. In the area of reforming markets, the singular area of action has been to address counterparty risks and non-transparency in the OTC market by taking all such markets onto central clearing platforms. Other elements impi nging on market functioning flow from the focus on entity regulation such as addressing excessive leverage, higher capital charge for trading and securitization transactions.   2 Borio, Claudio: Implementing the macroprudential approach to financial regulation and supervision , September 2009, Financial Stability Review, Banque de France   3 Bank of England, \u201cThe role of macroprudential policy \u201d, November 2009, Discussion Paper,   4 Borio, Claudio: Implementing the macroprudential approach to financial regulation and supervision , September 2009, Financial Stability Review, Banque de France Page  | 3                                                  9. Holistically speaking, regula tion of financial markets  per se would involve two separate strands, apart from entity regulation : (i) policy framework that includes the product sp ecifications, macro level regulations that apply to all entities operating in this market, systemic  safeguards, nature of participants, reporting requirements etc.  (ii) operational aspects of trading an d post-trade clearing and settlement; 10. The concept of market regulation in most of the developed financial centres has largely been concentrated around the operational aspects of trading \u2013 the conduct of business part and has left prudential focus to entity regulation. More im portantly, there was no e xplicit policy framework for markets from a stability perspective. Mr. Ho ward Davies, the previous chairman of the FSA recently admitted that \u201cThe political mood, and certainly the mood in the markets, was that regulators should observe how mar kets evolved and try to  craft their regulatory environment to cope with the risks that emerged. We ha ve now seen that an approach of that sort  can step too far back...We now can see that if you step to o far back, trends can develop in a way which creates trouble, and that there needs to be, I th ink, more self-confidence in the regulatory world to be prepared to step in at an earlier stage  and to challenge the judgm ents of the markets.\u201d511. It is surprising that this paradoxical approach Mr. Howard Davies talks about is not being altered even now though there is recognition of th e need to monitor system ic interconnectedness. The macro-prudential approach to regulation, now being consid ered imperative for financial entities, is still some way from being applied to financial markets.  12. Just to illustrate, one of the arguments ag ainst the way financial products have evolved relates to the problem of information asymmetr ies: the gulf between the market makers and market takers. Large financial firms run huge positions across multiple assets and have the ability as well as incentive to move markets in a way advantageous for them. This is not merely an exaggerated concern: there are increasing numb er of articles trying to interpret the link between the creation and selling of CDOs by larg e investment firms on underlying securities of doubtful nature prior to the cris is and simultaneously going short. In plain words, on the one hand you sell the derivatives  to less informed investors betti ng on the upside, while at the same time place huge bets to gain yourself from the downs ide. Here comes the systemic perspective in regulation: what may be good for a particular entity may be sowing seeds of instability for the system.  13. As part of general public discourse many inte resting issues are bei ng raised and debated fiercely, particularly relating to the social good being contributed by the markets and the systemic implications of some of the innovation s. I came across an interesting classification of opinionists in the context of the raging debate on  climate change \u2013 calamitists and denialists at the two extremes and warners and skeptics somewhere in the middle6. Through the crisis, there have been similar voices in the co ntext of the role of markets. On  one end of the spectrum are the  5 Interview to the Wall Street Journal, D ecember 13, 2009, Future of Finance Initiative 6 Stewart Brand, \u201cFour Sides to Every Story \u201d, www.edge.org Page  | 4  denialist notions that there is inherently nothing wrong with the markets and the primary drivers for the crisis lay in the macro-economic realm. At  the other end, there are the calamitists arguing for a radical shift in the way markets are regulated since they have failed spectacularly. The truth, as usual may lie somewhere in the middle. Some key issues have indeed been acknowledged and are being addressed. There have been broad agreements on the principles, the problem is that these are th e common minimum principles a nd the implementation is being driven by contextual is sues in each country. Interconnectedness 14. The crisis has highlighted the importan ce of improving our unde rstanding of inter-connectedness in the financial system through dire ct links between financial institutions and the indirect links created through financial markets. The key channels  of propagation of risks are maturity mismatches and leverage.   15. In regard to direct links, there is need fo r bringing all inter-bank/intra-financial system exposures both on and off-balance sheet within the macro pruden tial framework. While there are prudential requirements for individual bank\u2019s exposur es to other banks, there is appreciation of the need to prescribe safeguards on the liabilities  side of the balance sh eet too and to ensure availability of adequate good quality liquid assets.   16. The growth in financial sector over the pa st few years has been exponential. While many have argued that this has also contributed to real economy growth, behind the numbers lays the critical role of leverage and off-balance sheet financing. As me ntioned in the Turner Review, from about 2003 onwards there were significant increases in the measured on-balance sheet leverage of many commercial and investment banks, driven in some cases by dramatic increases in gross assets and derivative positions. This coupled with the growth  of \u2018shadow banking\u2019 meant that the so-called benefits from financia l sector growth have been mostly illusory.  17. Firms whose business models were based on high leverage and excessive dependence on uninterrupted access to secured f unding markets were highly vulnera ble in the crisis. Many firms relied on excessive short-term wholesale financi ng of long term illiquid assets including on cross border basis. During the crisis they were faced with lenders demanding s ubstantial cushions or haircuts on the assets they were willing to finance.  Moreover, these assets taken as collateral were illiquid and lenders failed to factor in this  risk.  This combined with excessive leverage accentuated the vulnerability.  18. The excessive dependence of entities on whol esale funding markets such as repo or other collateralised markets is an issue of systemic  concern since one, it accentuates systemic procyclicality through haircuts/margins and tw o, the leverage loop that builds through these markets in high liquidity periods induces rigidity and gets entren ched into funding models of entities. It is therefore imperative to bring the secured funding markets such as repo markets within the regulatory perimete r/macro prudential framework, pa rticularly since many entities participating in these markets are unregulated/lightly regulated. There is need for a cautious approach when the securities that are repo'ed/col lateralised carry credit risk and are illiquid.   Page  | 5  19. This also raises the issue of interconnectedness of banks to private pools of capital that are largely unregulated. While the reform of the fi nancial system does cover regulation of hedge funds, the general issue of banks exposures to these funds directly as well as through markets needs greater attention. The same applies to private equity which are unregulated entities. These entities rely on funding markets fo r leverage. From a macro prudent ial perspective it is not just necessary to regulate  banks exposures to these entities but also to limit the overall leverage of these entities  if they are permitted to access  funds directly from banks and other financial intermediaries and indirectly via funding markets.  OTC market infrastructure 20. A large number of initiatives are underway at the international le vel to strengthen the infrastructure for OTC derivatives, a clear amplifie r of stress particularly in credit derivatives market in the crisis as evidenced by AIG, B ear Stearns, Lehman episodes. The deficiencies within the OTC derivatives market viz. the ma nagement of counterparty credit risk and the absence of sufficient transparency have pushed the policy preference to exchange traded/centrally cleared models. However the specific proposals being discussed in various countries do envisage continuance of non-standardised OTC cont racts albeit with a stricter bilateral collaterali zation requirement and higher capital charge.  21. Increasingly more nuanced pers pectives on this issue are being articulated, the most recent one being the discussion paper of December 2009 from the HMT and the FSA in UK which argues against the need for mandating the trad ing of standardized derivatives on organized trading platforms provided steps are taken to impr ove transparency and mitigate the risks of OTC derivatives. According to this paper regulatory objectives of reducing counterparty risk and improving transparency can be achieved by ot her means and they would review progress of initiatives in this area. Moreover, mandating the use of organised platforms would imply a regulatory imposition of trading structure, whic h they do not believe is necessary. The paper argues that mere standardisabil ity cannot be a sufficient conditio n for central clearing and other factors such as availability of prices, depth of market liquidity and whether the product contains inherent risk attributes that cannot be mitigated by the CCP need to be considered by regulators.   22. The essence of a CCP arrangement is netting and margining, which are contingent on homogeneity of the underlying asset, availability  of reliable prices and sound risk models to capture future potential exposures. The abilit y of models to capture  tail risks has been comprehensively put to question post crisis. How would the exchanges be better able to measure and manage risk where some of the biggest financial firms with  the soundest risk management systems failed?  This would be part icularly true of cred it products such as CDS. In this context, the nature of collateral regime becomes extremely important. Any in strument with a  credit risk element would inherently not be suitable for a co llateral. If these aspect s are not addressed by the regulators, mandatory clearing would only resu lt in a potentially riskier system.     23. The real sector i.e. end users are opposing mandatory move to exchanges and clearing platforms on the ground that the crisis was inherently due to complex transactions between financial intermediaries and there should be no incr ease in cost to the real  sector, i.e. genuine end-users, for undertaki ng derivative trades.  Page  | 6                                                  24. Currently, a CPSS-IOSCO Committee is looking in to the existing standards for the systemic entities like the CCP. Given the natu re of their functions which require incentives for strong risk management and building adequate financial reso urces in the form of settlement guarantee funds and their systemic importance, it  is worthwhile to consider cen tral counterparties as \u201cpublic utility\u201d and not-for profit ent ities to reduce moral hazard.   25. A key criticism of the proposed reforms has been that it doesn\u2019t a ddress the fundamental issue of speculative use of derivatives and excessi ve financialisation of a ll products. In fact, by transferring most of OTC market onto exchanges, it might be further accentuating it. It is not surprising to hear major global exchanges as well as brokers bett ing on a manifold increase in the CDS market as a result of electronic trading and centr al clearing. A recent study7 has found that of the gross CDS position of 23 large US Banks  only around 2 per cent was for hedging the rest was for their dealer activities. T hough the figures pertain to 2005, they  give a fair idea of really how much of the CDS market was actually for pure speculation. Speculation does play an economic role in increasing market liquidity and price discovery but beyond a point, trading without an underlying interest co uld only increase systemic risk particularly when the same market prices and volatilities get entrenched into the balan ce sheets of the real sector.  Rating Agencies 26. Another area where progress has been slow rela tes to the rating agencies. There have been some proposals to mitigate conflicts between raters and issuers who pay them but these have largely been in the nature of more disclo sures by rating agencies and separation of the consultancy/advisory roles. Some of the funda mental issues have been left unaddressed, particularly the methodological issues, accountabili ty arrangements and over-stretching of rating agencies. A key issue that has not been addressed is the ratings given by rating agencies based on implicit support without the need  to disclose the rating status  without such implicit support. From the point of view of transparency to inve stors and accountability there is need for further disclosures in this regard.   Capital account management  27. For emerging countries the macro prudential fram ework has also to deal  with vulnerability arising from cross-border capital flows, currenc y mismatches and foreign currency liquidity in the financial system. Rapid and vo latile capital inflows or outflows can present significant policy challenges\u2014potentially leading to  exchange rate overshooting, asse t price volatilit y and financial instability. In this context, appr opriate and pragmatic use of cap ital account regulations may have to be considered by emerging markets in order to  maintain financial stability if considered necessary.     7 Minton, Bernadette, Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, and Rohan Williamson, January 2008, \u201c How much do banks use credit derivatives to hedge loans?, Fisher College of Business Working Paper Series  Page  | 7                                                  Market Discipline 28. In the past, it has been argue d that market discipline can pl ay a key role in incentivising market participants to limit their excessive risk taking activities. However, the events of the last few years have proved the inadequacy of market discipline and bankers have been engaged in risk-taking activities disguised as value-creation. Time and again market participants have engaged in herd behaviour and put the financia l system at risk. It is poignant to note how relevant Charles Mackay\u2019s observation in his popular book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and Madness of Crowds, written  in 1841, even today . Mackay wrote , \u2018\u2018Men, it has been well said think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one\u201d. The events of the past few years tell us that  market discipline expressed via market prices canno t be expected to play a major role in constraining risk taking, and that the primary constraint needs to  come from regulation and supervision.  29. So how do we manage the trad e-off between financial stability, effective regulations on the one hand and free markets on the other? One, the responsibility for financial stability cannot be fragmented across several regulato rs; it has to rest unambiguously with a single entity, and that single entity optimally is the cen tral bank. And second, that there is need for coordination across regulators on a regular basis and for developing a protocol for re sponding to a crisis situation8.   30. In my opinion, any regulation that is envisa ged should be based on the touchstone of the following: Regulations that does not lead to exce ssive leverage of not only financial institutions, but also of households and corporates. Regula tions that augment the market process and strengthen the invisible hand. Regulations that address the info rmation problems associated with complex financial instruments and improve the transparency of instruments and institutions.  Regulations that acknowledge and address the system ically important nature of key markets that have wider implications for the real economy. Regulations that recognize and address the country specific circumstances.   Part II \u2013 Indian context 31. Having touched upon some of the broad issues for financial regulation in the context of emerging global consensus, let me turn to the Indi an context. I would like to briefly review the key developments in major markets and try to flag some of the unsettled issues.   Money Markets 32. The overnight rates have an important contributory role in terms of managing day to day liquidity  and as a point of origin for building expectations on the term structure of interest rates. Domestically, while the overnight rates have mo re or less remained around the corridor in the recent past, the daily cash maintained by the banking system with RBI\u2013 one of the most important determinants of the overnight rates -  have remained highly volatile as compared to the required CRR balances.   8 Subbarao, Duvvuri , Financial Stability: Issues and Challenges , September 2009  Page  | 8  0246810121416%The Interest rate corridor and the daily weighted average overnight rate R everse repo Rat e R epo-60000-40000-20000020000400006000080000100000Difference b/ w actual & required cash balance 33. Therefore, despite the daily overnight rates remaining around th e interest rate  corridor, the daily absolute change in the weighted average rates have not been smooth.     -6.00-4.00-2.000.002.004.006.008.00%Changes i n Pol i cy Rat esChange in Repo Rate Ch an ge  i n  Re v e r se  Re p o  Rat e-6.00-4.00-2.000.002.004.006.008.00%Changes in Weighted Average Overnight Rates 34. While we are all aware of the skewed distribution of liquidity  in the banking system due to different balance sheet sizes of  the banks, the rapid roll-out of RTGS system and the core banking solutions perhaps offers us an opportunity  to go back to the drawing board and optimize the day to day liquidity management to redu ce the opportunity costs and more importantly improve the ability to lend on term basis.  The term money market continues to remain dormant with low turnover despite severa l initiatives taken by the Reserv e Bank, mainly reflecting the inability of the market participants to take a medium-term view on interest rates and liquidity, corporates\u2019 continued preference for cash cred it and other modes of loan disbursements. However, the CD market is active and  refl ects the unsecured term money market rates.   35. RBI has addressed the issue of vulnerabilities  arising from excessive intra financial sector activity by limiting the unsecured overnight market  to banks and primary dealers and imposing limits on unsecured borrowing and lending in overnight markets as also by limiting the gross  interbank liabilities.   36. On the market infrastructure side, over the y ears, the collateralised se gment of money market has assumed increasing importance for the entire  gamut of market players including non-banks without engendering financial instability. All co llateralized trad es including market repos are settled through a CCP. These developments have contributed to the increased transparency and liquidity in these markets and imparted stability to the financial markets.  Page  | 9  37. On the regulatory front, the gap that existed in  the case of NCDs with maturities less than one year has received the regulatory attention. Non Convertib le Debentures of maturity of less than one year are being issued with i nnovative features such as, interest  rates linked to overnight rate, American style put/call optionality, which impa rts demand liability character to these instruments. Further, the innovative features and the high amount of  issuance of such instruments pose systemic risks. The suggestion of the market participants in expandi ng the eligible entities that can act as Debenture Trustees for the issuance of NCDs with less than one year maturities is being examined  by the Reserve Bank. However, the suggestion for relaxing the minimum tenor of these NCDs from the proposed tenor of 90 days to 7 days cannot be acceded to as under the law, corporates are prohibited from issuing unsecured debentures  with maturity of less than 90 days. Allowing markets to issue very short-term instruments can have systemic implications.  In any case, there are other instruments in the shor t-end like repo, CBLO and CPs that can meet the requirement of investors. Fixed income markets 38. The fixed income markets in India, as is th e case with the develope d world is dominated by the Government securities markets. A lot has been  done to develop the market infrastructure for the Government securities markets in the past tw o decades and most of the issues that remains now have to do with the development of the non-bank non- instituti onal interests in the government securities. In India, th e reasons for lack of retail intere st lies in the availability of alternative instruments with higher yields and better tax treatm ent and the small savings window for those in need of risk free instruments.  Nevertheless, the experience gained in the development of the Government securities market  microstructure will stand us in good stead in further development of the Corporate Bond mark ets and certain other segments of the money markets mentioned earlier.  Government securities market 39. Of the various reforms towards development of  the Government securities market, the most significant one, I must say was the issuance of G-secs through auction, followed and backed by development of market infrastructure such as trade reporting platforms for real time dissemination, DvP and CCP clearing and settlement .   Introduction and gradual relaxation of repo has also significantly contri buted to the liquidity.The Reserve Bank has also taken up the revision of repo accounting to reflect the true economic essence of the transaction on the books of both the repo seller as well as th e repo buyer.  The final guidelines are set to be issued shortly.    Initiatives to widen investor base 40. In last few years, many initiatives have been  taken to widen the i nvestor base in G-Sec Market. The Reserve Bank, in consultation with th e Central Government and State Governments, has introduced the Non-Competitive Bidding in the Auction of Central Government securities and State Development Loans. NDS-OM has been  extended to insurance companies, qualified Mutual Funds, Provident Funds and Pension Funds  in a phased manner. Further, changes have been made in the manner in which bids are submitt ed in the auctions of the Government of India securities so as to improve the efficiency of th e auction procedure as also the timeliness of data dissemination.   Page  | 10  41. With the average daily trading volumes of  about Rs. 13,000 crore a nd Rs. 22,000 crore in outright and repo market respectively , the G-sec markets are on the growth path.    Primary Dealers  42. With an objective to render the Government Securities market vibrant, liquid and broad based, the Reserve Bank introduced the system of Primary Dealer s (PDs) in 1995. In order to broad base the Primary Dealership system, banks were permitted to undertake Primary Dealership business departmentally in 2006-07. Fu rther, the standalone PDs were permitted to diversify into other business activities. With the induction of two new PDs in 2009, there are currently 19 PDs comprising 11 banks undertak ing PD business departmentally and eight standalone PDs.  As you are aware, in vi ew of the underwriting and market making responsibility of PDs, they have been given ac cess to Current Account facility and Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) Account facility (for Gove rnment securities) with  the Bank, permission to borrow and lend in the money market including call money market and to trade in all money market instruments, membership of electronic dealing, trading and se ttlement systems (NDS platforms/INFINET/RTGS/CCIL), access to the Liquidity Adjustme nt Facility (LAF) of RBI, access to liquidity support from RBI under a scheme  separately notified for standalone PDs and favoured access to open market operations by the Reserve Bank.   Performance of PDs in Primary Auctions of Government Securities 43. The share of PDs (ratio of bids accepted from  PDs to the total notified amount) in primary auctions of Central Government dated securities  (Table 1) has been significant since 2006 when the Bank stopped participating in primary auctions , ensuring full subscription to the Government securities.  Table 1: Performance of PDs in primar y auctions of Government securities                                                                                                                      (In Rs. cr ore) Details 2006-07 2007-08 2008-09 2009-10 *   Notified Amount          146,000           156,000           261,000                           295,000  Bids Submitted by PDs          202,462           254,253           349,393                           361,325  Bids accepted of PDs            64,727             72,122           111,094                           117,023  Bid-to-cover ratio 1.39 1.63 1.34 1.22 Success Ratio 31.97% 28.37% 31.80% 32.39% Share of PDs 44.33% 46.23% 42.56% 39.67% * - till end-September 2009 Source: Trend & Progress 2009      Page  | 11  Recent initiatives 44. In view of the enhanced borrowings by th e Government of India in 2008-09 and 2009-10 as part of the counter-cyclical po licy in response to slowdown, stru ctured meetings with PDs and other major investors were taken up on a regular basis to obtain market feedback and exchange views on relevant issues.  The major initia tives taken during the current fiscal are:  (i) Consequent to the global financial crisis, the spread  between corporate bond and Government securities turned out more than 500  bps due to credit crunch in the financial markets.  To enable the PDs to raise Tier II  and Tier III capital, ceiling on interest rate spread at the time of issue of the subordinated instrument s was removed effective from April 1, 2009.  (ii) Stand-alone PDs were allowed to categorize a portion of their Government Security portfolio in the HTM cat egory till March 31, 2010.  (iii)In order to aid stand-alone PDs in managi ng their funding requirement, PDs are allowed to borrow from call money market, on an average in a fortnight, up to 225 per cent up from 200 per cent.  (iv) In the backdrop of global financia l crisis and the need to have  strongly capitalized entities to ensure financial stability, the minimum NOF for stand-alone PDs undertaking only G-sec business, was increased from Rs. 50 cror e to Rs. 150 crore and for the stand-alone PDs, which intend to undertak e other permissible activities, NOF is enhanced to Rs.250 crore from the existing level of Rs. 100 cror e. The enhanced level of NOF requirement shall be effective from April 1, 2010.  (v) PDs are allowed to deal in Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) for both hedging and trading on own account .  45. The RBI is impressing upon the PDs to expand their outreach to widen the investor base for government securities and act as  market makers for the smalle r entities in non-institutional segment.  Corporate Bond Market :   46. Corporate Bond market segment has received inte nse attention in recent times as it has been identified as one of the growth engines for furt her development of the Indian economy with vast infrastructure needs.  A well developed corporat e bond market not only enables the corporates to tap the markets for their financing needs and resu lt in efficient allocation of resources but also acts as a much desired supplement for the bank fi nancing thereby reducing the systemic stress.  There has been a spurt in the secondary market  activity in the corporate bond markets.  The secondary market volumes have gone up from  Rs. 5000 crore in 2007 to about Rs.30,000 crore in 2009. The bond issuance through private placement in the first half of 2009-10 has shown an increase of 25 per cent over the corresponding period previous year, with financial service sector accounting for 71 per cent of the mobilization. The F IIs have been allowed to invest up to $15 bn in corporate bonds. The actual utili zation is however very low. Th e streamlining of clearing and settlement processes by mandating the DvP settlemen t of corporate bonds is expected to increase the market activity including public issues by mitigating the settlement risks.    47. Introduction of OTC repo in corporate bonds, as already a nnounced, would further enhance the secondary market activity by encouraging more  participants to hold bonds.  However, we Page  | 12                                                  need to tread with prudence since the repo fac ilitates leverage. As indicated earlier secured funding markets globally were the key leverage-e nabling channels that played an exacerbating role during the crisis. While such collaterali zed funding markets generally help market integration by enabling participan ts to fund their long positions a nd deliver into short positions and by helping them to manage th eir short term liquidity needs, during times of crisis, the same mechanism may accentuate the crisis by forcing the borrowers into insolvency due to steep fall in the value of collaterals, lead ing to margin calls and fire sales (Gorton and Metrick, 2009).     48. The feedback received on the draft guidelines ha s largely been positive but the key issue that has been raised relates to  inclusion of short te rm money market instrume nts such as CDs/CPs as eligible securities for repo. To begin with, it is proposed to start only with highly rated bonds. The final guidelines in this re gard would be issued shortly.  Foreign Exchange Market 49. There has been a sharp increase in the liquid ity in the Indian forex market between 1997-98 and 2007-08, resulting from the nine fold increase in turnover over this period and low and stable bid-ask spreads9.  The 25% compounded annual growth in turnover and the doubling of the merchant to inter-bank turnover ratio during this period was reflective of   accelerated pace of economic growth and increased openness of the domestic financial markets. The turnover is almost equally accounted for by the spot and derivatives market s. The derivatives market is dominated by swaps followed by forwards. Curre ncy futures have also  been introduced in recognised stock exchanges since August 2008 to facilitate hedging by residents.   50. The sudden change in the external environm ent that started around mid-September 2008 led to heightened volatility in the currency market . The Rupee exhibited a sharp downward trend, like other emerging market currencies, in the backdrop of de-leveraging in global financial markets, sharp declines in equities markets an d deterioration in the inter-bank money markets prompting investors to shun emerging market a ssets. While FDI flows exhibited resilience, access to ECBs and trade credits was rendered somewhat difficult.  The net outflows under portfolio investment, banki ng capital and short-term trade cred it led to capital account balance having turned negative during the third quart er (October-December) of 2008-09, the first time since the first quarter of 1998-99.   51. In this context, the Reserve Bank took all pr eemptory actions as necessary to preserve orderly conditions in the markets. Apart from  undertaking market opera tions to bridge the demand supply gap, other measures were also taken such as upward adjustment of the interest rate ceiling on the foreign currency deposits by non-resident Indians, su bstantially relaxing the external commercial borrowings (ECB) regime for corporates, and allowing non-banking financial companies and housing finance compan ies to access foreign borrowing. The RBI had also introduced special forex sw aps of tenors up to three mont hs on November 7, 2008 in order to provide flexibility to Indian banks in mana ging their short-term funding requirements at their overseas offices.   9 BIS triennial survey 2007. In the aftermath of the failure of the Lehman brothers, bid-ask spreads increased sharply. Page  | 13                                                  52. The average daily turnover of FCY-INR in the foreign exchange  market (including forwards and FX swaps) decreased from USD 33.44 billio n in July 2008 to USD 29.45 billion in October 2009. While the turnover in the inter-bank segment fell from USD 25.48 billion to USD 20.23 billion, that in the merchant segment incr eased from USD 7.96 bill ion to USD 9.22 billion .    Derivatives Market  Interest Rate Derivatives 53. The interest rate deregulation not only made financial market operations efficient and cost-effective but also exposed participants to increased risks. The OIS market is the most widely used OTC derivative instrument in India for hedging interest rate risk, re flective of the absence of the term money market in India. The CCI L launched the reporting platform for OTC Rupee Interest Rate Swaps (IRS/FRA) in August 2007 and commenced non-guaranteed settlement in November 2008.  54. With most of the market microstructure of the G-sec market well estab lished, it set the stage for the re-launch of the Interest Rate Futures market in August 2009. RBI has on its part put in place the physical delivery infrastructure that crea tes an interface of the Public Debt Office with the clearing houses of the exchange s with near straight  through processing ability. RBI has also given its approval to the exchanges to reduce th e delivery period in the IRF to one single day. The market participants should ultimately harness the hedging poten tial that this product has to offer. One of the primary reasons for  going in for physi cal settlement in the IRF as against cash settlement was precisely to link the cash segmen t with the futures segment, which would be critical for hedging purposes.   55. Unlike in other markets, there is a regulat ory framework for OTC markets in cash and derivatives   markets in instruments coming under RBI regulatory purview. There is a role for  OTC markets since they can meet specific requir ements of end users. For the purpose of OTC interest rate derivatives we have classified the participants into market makers and users. These products have achieved considerable amount of st andardization that has in turn facilitated technological intervention. We have already achieved significant success in the trade reporting and settlement of these OTC interest rate products . We are therefore, significantly ahead on these parameters compared to most of the developed markets.   56. While there has been a significant bu ildup of outstanding notional principal10  the market participation is much skewed. As per the late st CCIL data, the foreign banks dominated the MIBOR swap market with an average share of 81.96% as against the shar e of the private banks at 11.76%, Primary Dealers at 5.7 9% and public sector banks at 0.49% during October\u201909.  Further, foreign banks dominate d the MIFOR swap market with an average share of 87.38% as against that of th e private banks at 11.79% an d public sector banks at  0.83% during October\u201909. There is, therefore, a clear need for some of  the participants to scale up their level of participation in these markets.    10 - As per CCIL data, as on November 27, 2009, the tota l outstanding notional principal (inter-bank and PDs only) under MIBOR OIS stands at Rs.25,72,339 crore and that under MIFOR-OIS stands at Rs.7,62,356 crore as at November 27, 2009. Page  | 14   Currency Derivatives 57. The traded volume in USD-INR currency futu res contracts traded on all the exchanges gradually increased over the period and touche d the high of USD 5.46 billion on December 8, 2009.  The average traded volume remained at USD 3384 million during November 2009. On the other hand, the open interest position in th e currency futures remained at around USD 1 billion during the month with the average of USD 1105 million.   58. The substantial rise in the cu rrency futures volume, in a sense,  is quite natural keeping in view cash settlement, the lack of requireme nt of underlying exposure and absence of any restriction on cancellati on and re-booking, as curr ently applicable in the case of forward transactions. In case of forward foreign ex change contracts, AD Category-I banks, through verification of documentary ev idence, have to be satisfied about the genuineness of the underlying exposure, irrespective of the transaction being a cu rrent or a capital account transaction.   59. There has been growing demands from the mark et participants to allow trading of currency future contracts in other major currency pairs to f acilitate direct hedging of  their exchange risk in such currencies. Accordingly, in  the second quarter review of monetary policy, it has been proposed to permit the recognized stock excha nges to offer currency futures contracts in currency pairs of Euro-INR, Japanese Yen-INR and Pound Sterling-INR.   60. RBI had placed on its website the draft guidelin es on OTC forex derivatives, in light of the developments in the domestic and internationa l financial markets and based on the feedback received from banks, market partic ipants, industry associations and others. It is proposed in the draft guidelines to permit the importers and export ers having foreign currency exposures in trade transactions, to write covered call and put op tions both in foreign currency-rupee and cross currency and also receive premia. Accordingly, th e facility of zero cost structures is to be withdrawn.   61. There have been concerns on the downside ri sk involved in allowing the exporters/importers to write covered call and put options. This is the precise reason why th e draft guidelines had stipulated stringent preconditions for use of such products. The AD category I banks have to ensure that the customers have sound risk ma nagement system, the corporates should have adopted AS 30 and AS 32, the corporates can not combine these options with any other derivative products and moreover, the pricing of the premium has to be done in a transparent manner. We have also received feedback to conti nue the facility of zero cost structures since some of the companies find the instrument usef ul in managing currency risks. However, the bundling of asymmetric risks makes it complex in pricing as well as in valuation and can be opaque to the risk managers and top management.       62. It is also proposed to continue to allow pe rsons resident in India,  other than banks and financial institutions to use FCY-INR swaps to transform long-term INR borrowing into foreign exchange liability.  There have been concerns that the use of FCY-INR swap to convert long term Rupee borrowing into foreign exchange liab ility may lead to speculative trades in the Page  | 15  absence of underlying risk exposures. However, this  facility has been in existence for a decade and has supported distribution of foreign currency risks within  the Indian market without increasing the overall external debt. Such a faci lity may come handy for a corporate, especially the exporters, having future foreign exchange receivables. The foreign exchange liability position assumed through FX swap may match w ith the foreign exchange receivables and provide the benefit of hedging. The issue is sh ould such swaps be limited to only companies which have potential forex exposures. The road ahead 63. On the anvil is the introduction  of credit default swaps. We are at an advanced stage of introducing other currency pairs for currency futures and are examining the issue of allowing plain vanilla currency options in consultation with SEBI.   64. Broadly speaking, the mandate for financial s ector development should ideally derive from the regulatory assessments for each market. It has been clearly evidenced during the crisis that financial sector development per se cannot be an objective in itself. It needs to be pursued in the broader context of financial stabil ity and has to n ecessarily correspond to th e level of maturity of the financial system and the needs of the real  economy. Reforming financial markets involves improving access to simple, transparent, and easy- to-understand products. Increasing complexity does not facilitate the market mechanism.  The purpos e of financial instruments is to transfer risk to those that understand these risks, not to hide or camouflage them. Regulatory comfort and assessment should therefore be a critical de terminant in pursuing financial reforms.  65. In regard to derivatives, we have both OTC and exchange traded instruments for currency and interest rates. OTC markets in India are we ll regulated, unlike many other jurisdictions, to address issues of leverage and customer appr opriateness and suitability. Only OTC contracts where one party to the transaction is a RBI regul ated entity is considered legally valid. Suitable reporting and post trade clearing  and settlement mechanisms are being further strengthened. Given the incentive structures of  these market, convergence of regulatory frameworks for OTC and exchange traded markets cannot be an end in itself under present ci rcumstances, though it is a long term goal.   66. The development of markets is also influenced  by tax policies. Debt instruments for instance do not enjoy tax exemptions of th e nature enjoyed by equity inst ruments whether on income or capital gains. Mutual funds fixed income products  enjoy certain tax examptions not available to banks. But this is outside the regulatory pur view. However, if these policies introduce any vulnerability in the financial system there is  need to address this through appropriate macroprudential and micropr udential regulations.  67. Based on the assessment and experience, further liberalization measures for expanding the product menu could be undertaken. However, particip ation of foreigners in new products and the financial markets in general would continue to  be dictated by the cap ital account management and financial stability imperatives.  68. Thank you. I wish the conference all success.  ", "12 Feb 10 MP.pdf": "Challenges for Central Banks in the Context of the Crisis*By Duvvuri Subbarao  ___________________________________________________________________  Central banks and central bankers have b een at the heart of the global financial crisis. We have been blamed for policies and actions that got the world into the crisis; we are also being praised for leading from the fr ont in getting the world out of the crisis. I believe this is fair critique - central banks have  been a part of the pr oblem and a part of the solution.   2. As we emerge out of the crisis, central banks have their task cut out for them: to distil the lessons of the crisis, translate th em into concrete reform measures and get cracking on implementing them.  I believe this involves central banks changing in important ways both in terms of what they do an d how they do it. It is against this backdrop that the Reserve Bank of India thought it fit to organize th is conference on the challenges for central banks in the context of the crisis as a flagship event of our Platinum Jubilee celebrations. I have great pleasure in welcomin g all our invitees - colleague governors of central banks, leading international and dom estic policy makers and experts - to this conference, the first international conf erence being organized by the Reserve Bank. I want to specially acknowledge noted economist and Nobel Laureate  Prof. Michael Spence who will be delivering the keynote address in a short while.                                                    * Inaugural Address by Dr. Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India, at the International Research Conference on \u2018Challenges for Central Banks in the Context of the Crisis\u2019, Mumbai, February 12, 2010. 3. I struggled quite a lot in defining what I should say in this opening address. Given the breadth and depth of exper tise that you all collec tively bring to this forum, it would be presumptuous on my part to lay out the agenda  of deliberations over the next two days. I will attempt something much less ambitious - ju st by way of a curtain raiser, I will set out the major challenges to central banks in the wake of the crisis. In particular, I will put forward five challenges. My effort, as you will notice, will be to flag the issues rather than argue them out extensively.  First Challenge:  Managing Monetary Policy in a Globalizing Environment 4. The crisis has clearly demonstrated the challenges of macroeconomic management in a globalizing world. Even as governments and central banks acted with unusual show of policy force, they found that they were not able  to get the situation under control because of the interconnectedness of the financial syst em and the positive and negative cross-border externalities to domestic policy actions. Most  importantly, they found that sentiment and confidence were remarkably correlated across co untries around the world. When the history of this crisis is written, the London G-20 summit in April 2009 will be marked as a clear turning point, showing that in the age of globalizati on, a financial crisis  cannot be managed without global cooperation and global response.   5. The question is, with the benefit of that  hindsight, how are cen tral banks going to manage the challenges from globalization to their macroeconomic policies. Experience shows that external developments interact with domestic macro variables in complex, uncertain and even capricious ways, and central  banks need to deep en their understanding of these interactions. Some of  the channels through which cr oss border transmission occurs  2are quite familiar - global prices including co mmodity price movements, synchronization of business cycles, capital flows, strong co-m ovement of asset pric es, not necessarily correlated with the degree of a country\u2019s fi nancial integration, exchange rates of key international currencies and interest rate pol icies of major central banks. Some of the transmission channels are not so familiar. For example, we now know that even differences in regulatory regimes can tr igger arbitrage base d action and dilute the efficiency of domestic policies.   6. Is the challenge posed by globalization similar for all central banks? Obviously, the more open the economy, the greater the impact  of globalization on domestic policies. Beyond that, it seems logical to conjecture that the broader th e mandate of a central bank, the larger the influence of globalization on the effectiveness of its policies. There is a view that open economies can retain strong contro l over the medium and long term inflation trends even in the face of globalization. This is a debatable proposition, and at best true only in the case of pure inflation targeting central banks.  Cent ral banks with wider mandates need necessarily to factor in external developments into their domestic policy calculus.   7. Let me illustrate the challenge of globaliz ation with the issue of managing capital flows. Emerging market economies (EMEs) saw \u2018sudden stop\u2019 capital outflows during the crisis as a result of global deleveraging. Now the trend has reversed once again and many EMEs are seeing net inflows - a consequence of  a global system awash with liquidity, the assurance of a low interest rate regime in a dvanced countries over an  \u2018extended period\u2019 and the promise of growth in EMEs.   3 8. One little known aspect of capital flows, what could perhaps be called the law of capital flows, is that they never come in at the precise time or in the exact quantity you want them.  Managing these flows, especially  if they are volatile, is going to test the effectiveness of central bank po licies of semi-open EMEs. If central banks do not intervene in the foreign exchange market, they incur th e cost of currency appreciation unrelated to fundamentals. If they intervene in the forex ma rket to prevent appreciation, they will have additional systemic liquidity and potential infl ationary pressures to contend with. If they sterilize the resultant liquidity, they will run the risk of pushing up interest rates which will hurt the growth prospects. Capital flows can al so potentially impair financial stability. How EMEs manage the impossible trinity - the impo ssibility of having an open capital account, a fixed exchange rate and independent monetary policy - is going to have an impact on their prospects for growth, price stab ility and financial stability.  9. Globalization is not new; its  risks and rewards are also not new. What is new, and what the crisis has revealed, is the ferocity with which the forces of globalization can strike and the diversity of channels through whic h they can transmit across borders. The challenge for central banks is to better unde rstand the interplay of  global factors and domestic variables, and factor th at into their policy calculus.     Second Challenge:  Redefining the Mandate of Central Banks 10. Let me now move on to the second issue which is the challenge of redefining the mandate of central banks. The crisis has triggered a vigorous  and wide ranging debate on  4the role and responsibilities of central bank s. Let me focus on three main, and largely interrelated issues:  (i) Should central banks persist wi th pure inflation targetting?  (ii) What is the role of central banks  in preventing asset price bubbles?  (iii) Should central banks also be doing regulation and supervision of banks?  11. Let me take them up one by one.  (i) Should central banks persist wi th pure inflation targetting? 12. The first question is, should central banks pe rsist with inflation targetting. The years before the crisis saw a powerful intellectual consensus building around inflation targeting. A growing number of central banks, starting with New Z ealand in the late 1980s and currently numbering over  20, geared monetary policy almo st exclusively to stabilizing inflation. Even where central banks did not target a precise inflation rate, their policy objectives were informed, if not dominated,  by price stability. This approach seemed successful. There was an extended period of pr ice stability accompanied by stable growth and low unemployment. In the world that existe d before the crisis, cen tral bankers were a triumphant lot. They had discovered the holy grail.  13. The unravelling of the Great Moderation during the crisis has diluted, if not dissolved, the consensus around the minimalis t formula of inflation targetting. The mainstream view before the crisis was that pr ice stability and financ ial stability reinforce each other. The crisis has proved that wrong. We  have seen that price stability does not necessarily ensure financial stab ility. Indeed there is an even stronger asserti on - that there  5is a trade-off between price stability and financ ial stability and that the more successful a central bank is with price stability, the more  likely it is to imperi l financial stability.  14. All in all, the crisis ha s given fresh impetus to the \u2018new environment hypothesis\u2019 that pure inflation targetting is inadvisable and that the mandate of central banks should extend beyond just price stability. Let me theref ore turn to what the mandate should extend to.  (ii) What is the role of central banks in preventing asset price bubbles? 15. A dominant issue in the wake of the cris is has been the role of central banks in preventing asset price bubbles. The monetary st ance of studied indifference to asset price inflation stemmed from the famous Greensp an orthodoxy which can be summarized as follows. First, asset price bubbles are hard to identify on a real time basis, and the fundamental factors that drive asset prices are not directly  observable. A central bank should not therefore second guess the market.  Second, monetary policy is too blunt an instrument to counteract asset price booms. And third, central banks can \u2018clean up the mess\u2019 after the bubble bursts. The surmise theref ore was that the cost-benefit calculus of a more activist monetary stance of \u201cleaning agai nst the wind\u201d was clearl y negative. In other words, it is not the job of cen tral bankers to remove the punc h bowl no matter that the party is getting wild.   16. The crisis has dented the credibilit y of the Greenspan orthodoxy. The emerging view post-crisis is that preventing an asset price build up should be within the remit of a central bank. Opinion is divi ded, however, on whether central  banks should prevent asset bubbles through monetary policy action or throug h regulatory action. On one side, there is  6a purist view that the case for monetary tightening to check speculative bubbles is questionable. Opposed to this is the argument that a necessary condition for speculative excesses is abundant liquidity, and that contro lling liquidity should be the first line of defence against \u2018irrational exuberance\u2019.   17. Some economists take a more granular position on this, and the argument goes as follows. It is important to differentiate between speculative excesses fuelled by bank lending and those that are not such as, for ex ample, the IT bubble. Central banks have a role in preventing \u201cbank centr ed\u201d bubbles, but the instrument for this is not monetary policy but regulatory intervention.   18. No matter how this debate settles, if it will at all, what is beyond debate is that central banks\u2019 efforts to check  asset price bubbles demand not ju st analytical capability but mature judgement of the nature of the risk.      (iii) Should central banks also be doing bank regulation and supervision? 19. The third issue that I want to address in re gard to the mandate of central banks is the question of whether central banks should al so be doing bank regulation and supervision.  20. This is yet another issue on which the crisis has triggered a vigorous debate. There is a variety of regulatory models around incl uding those where the central bank is a pure monetary authority with bank re gulation and supervision vested  with another agency. Post-crisis, the emerging view is that the crisis was caused, at least in part, by the lack of  7coordination and communication between the sepa rate bodies and that it is optimal, in the interest of financial stability, to entrust the function of regulation a nd supervision of banks also to central banks.   21. The case for this is made mainly on two arguments. The first argument is that regardless of the regulatory architecture, ther e is no dispute that the central bank has to remain the lender of last resort (LOLR) for the financial system. A central bank can discharge its LOLR function more efficien tly if its mandate extends beyond merely monitoring financial institutions to taking preventive action. This becomes possible if the central bank also has respons ibility for bank supervision.  22. The second and broader argument is th at there is a natu ral synergy between monetary policy which is macro-prudentia l and bank supervision which is micro-prudential. The micro-level information coming from supervision of individual institutions can be a valuable input for shaping the macro perspective. Vice versa, a broad macro level understanding of trends can be effective in instituting prudential safeguards at the micro institutional level.  23. Admittedly, there are strong arguments to  the contrary, in support of keeping bank regulation and supervision away from central banks. By far the most persuasive argument stems from the moral hazard perspective. Ther e is a risk that a central bank may extend regulatory forbearance to a weak bank instead of  allowing it to fail since a failed bank could aggravate instability. Such action become s more likely if the overall macroeconomic situation is weak. In an extrem e case, it is possible that the monetary stance of the central  8bank may be dominated by concerns about protecting weak banks since central banks may view a \u2018failed bank\u2019 as a blot on their reputation.  24. Whether central banks should also be regul ating and supervising banks is an issue that has frowned on moderation. Evidently, there is no one size fits all answer as indeed evidenced by the variety of regulatory models around. Going forward, every country and every central bank has to conf ront and resolve this issue in light of their specific circumstances.  Third Challenge:  Responsibility of Ce ntral Banks Towards Financial Stability  25. Let me move on to the third challenge on my  list concerning what responsibility, if any, should central banks have towards financ ial stability. Although this question belongs to the mandate of central banks that I have just spoken about, I have decided to address financial stability as a separate and distinct challenge because post-cris is, financial stability has become the elephant in the room.  26. While there is broad agreement that fina ncial stability  is neither automatic nor inevitable, there is less agreement on whether it should be explicitly included in the mandate of central banks. There is an argumen t that explicit inclus ion would be redundant since financial stability is a necessary, although not sufficient, condition for achieving the conventional central bank objectives relating to inflation, output and employment. On the other hand, post-crisis, there is a growing view that unless financial stability is explicitly included in the mandate of central banks, it is likely to fall through the cracks.   927. But how does one define financial stab ility in a precise, comprehensive and measurable manner? This is something that is proving to be quite intractable. Be that as it may, we now know that two attrib utes of financial instability ar e: (i) excessive volatility of macro variables such as interest rates and exch ange rates which have a direct impact on the real economy; and (ii) financial institutions and markets threatened by illi quidity to the extent of jeopardizing systemic stability.  28. One clear instrument available to central banks for preserving financial stability is the lender of last resort or LOLR function. Over the years we  have come to believe that LOLR is a fairly robust instrument for combati ng threats of illiquidity. Note that one of the important ways in which this crisis has been diffe rent from past financial crises is that this one arose from the asset side of banks\u2019 balanc e sheets whereas past crises had all arisen from the liability side. This crisis hence has shown that the LOLR inst rument loses much of its potency in a \u2018bank run\u2019 from the asset side.   29. Let me explain. During the crisis, cent ral banks pumped in enormous amounts of liquidity to defreeze the system through the LOLR window. While this made individual institutions liquid, the market still remain ed illiquid, thereby showing up the limitation of the LOLR instrument in combating illiquidity. Much like taking a horse to water, a central bank can infuse liquidity, but how can it ensure that the cheap and abundant money thus available is used to purchase assets whose value is rapidly eroding? The only option then is for the central bank itself to buy the assets. This means that in addition to being the Lender of Last Resort, a central bank also has to be  the Market Maker of Last Resort (MMLR).     1030. To sum up, the main issues surrounding th e role of central banks in financial stability are the following.  \u2022 How does one define fi nancial stability?  \u2022 Should central bank mandates include financial stability as an explicit objective?  \u2022 Should this be an exclusive or shared responsibility?  \u2022 Do central banks have the instruments to address the mandate of financial stability?  \u2022 In what ways does responsibility for financial stability encroach on the independence of central banks?  31. All of these issues are yet to be clearly defined, let alone resolved. Given that the lessons of the crisis relating to financial stabil ity have been forceful, it is important that governments and central banks resolve these questions soon.  Fourth Challenge:  Managing the Costs and Benefits of Regulation 32. Nearly everyone now has her or his own list of causes for the crisis; and almost every list includes the failure of regulation as a leading ca use. Quite unsurprisingly, the post-crisis reform agenda is dominated by re gulatory reforms at macro and micro levels. Admittedly, these reforms are being thought through carefully through international consultative processes. Even so, there is a risk of going overboard on the rebound and getting the balance between costs and benefits wrong.   33. In order to safeguard financial stability, in the Reserve Bank, we have traditionally used a variety of prudential measures such as specifying exposure norms and pre-emptive tightening of risk weights and provisioning requirements. But these measures are not  11always costless. For instance, tightening of risk  weights arguably tempers the flow of credit to certain sectors, but excessive, premature or unnecessary tighteni ng could blunt growth. Similarly, exposure norms offer protection ag ainst concentration ri sks; however, such limits could restrict the availability of credit for important growth sectors. Thus, as in the case of price stability, central banks face the challenge of managing the trade off between financial stability and growth.   34. It needs to be recognized that after a crisis, with the benefit of hindsight, all conservative policies appear safe. But is ther e a risk of throwing away the baby with the bathwater? Excessive conservati sm in order to be prepared to ride out a potential crisis could thwart growth and stifle  innovation. The question is what price are we willing to pay, or put another way, what potential benefits are we willing to give up, in order to cope with a black swan event? Experience shows that managing this challenge, that is balancing the costs and benefits of regulation, is more a que stion of good judgement rather than analytical skill. This judgement skill is th e one that central banks, especially those of developing countries such as India, need to hone as  they simultaneously pur sue the objectives of growth and financial stability.   Fifth Challenge:  Managing the Balance Between the Autonomy and         Accountability of Central Banks  35. Finally, let me turn to the fifth challenge, as I see, which is to do with managing the balance between the autonomy and accountability of central banks. This is a broad spectrum topic that draws from several issues that I have touched upon earlier.   1236. The seventy odd years since the Great De pression saw a famous rivalry between fiscal and monetary policies for influence. Hi storically central banks  suffered from fiscal dominance since they had to acquiesce in gover nments \u2018borrowing as much as required at as low a cost as possible\u2019. This state of affairs starte d changing in the 1980s with a wave of support for central bank independence. The sup port was largely in re sponse to the damage inflicted by the stagflation of the 1970s and the clear lesson that high inflation is detrimental to sustainable growth. So, fiscal  dominance gradually yielded to independent central banks targetting largely, and in some cas es exclusively, price st ability, free of short term political imperatives. Empirical work shows that in the two decades during which central bank independence gained ascendanc y, there was a negative correlation between inflation and the degree of independence of  the central bank across both developed and developing economies. In some cases though, reve rse causality - low inflation performance leading to central bank indepe ndence - cannot be ruled out.  37. Notwithstanding their record on price stabil ity, the crisis has de nted the credibility of central banks. The blame on central banks is wide ranging - loose monetary policies coupled with neglect of asset price developm ents, exclusive focus on inflation to the detriment of financial stability and lax and inep t regulation that failed to keep pace with innovation. There is resentment, if not outrage, against the fa med independence of central banks; and there is an outcry for clipping th eir mandates and tightening the accountability mechanisms.   38. Beyond the short-term, the threat to the independence of central banks emanates from factors apart from public anger. Nota bly, the crisis saw unprecedented expansionary  13fiscal and monetary policies launched by gove rnments and central banks in coordination. As countries contemplate exit from these e xpansionary policies, the familiar tensions between monetary and fiscal policies are showing up again. Many believe that these tensions are temporary, and will melt away once recovery takes root.   39. That may not well be the case. There is  wide spread apprehension that many advanced country governments will not be able to wind down borrowing because of demographic factors and consequent growin g social security payments. IMF studies estimate that even if the governments in the ad vanced economies reverse the crisis induced fiscal stimulus, these economies will still end up with a structural primary deficit of 2 per cent of GDP. Government debt in the advanced  economies is projected to jump from the pre-crisis level of 78 per cent of GDP in 2007 to 118 per cent by 2014 assuming some discretionary tightening beginni ng this year. In such a scenario, what are now seen as cyclical fiscal deficits may, in fact, morph into  structural fiscal defi cits. We may then see the return of fiscal dominance and undermin ing of the independence of central banks.  40. I spoke earlier about the role of central ba nks in preserving financial stability, and in particular, about how the respons ibility for financial stability may be delineated. By its very nature, the responsibility for fi nancial stability ha s to be shared by  the government, the central bank and other regulators. In and of its elf, that sharing is no problem. But there are two related concerns. The first is that rescuing financial institutions is an inherently political act and getting invol ved in such decisions may co mpromise the technocratic credentials of central banks. The second concern is the ri sk that coordination with  14governments in the area of financial stability may spill over into othe r areas within central bank purview thereby undermining their independence.  41. All in all, the case for central bank independence is coming under increasing assault as a result of crisis led developments. The ch allenge for central banks is to make the case for independence not through weighty arguments  but through more vigorous and voluntary efforts to be transparent, responsive and accountable.   Conclusion 42. Let me now conclude. I have raised, what  are in my view, five challenges that central banks will have to address. They are the following: (i) Managing monetary policy in a globalizing environment  (ii) Redefining the mandate of central banks  (iii) Responsibility of central banks  towards financial stability  (iv) Managing the costs and be nefits of regulation  (v) Managing the balance between the au tonomy and accountability of central banks  43. This listing of challenges  is by no means exhaustive.  And many different nuances are possible. I hope that our deli berations over the next two days will give us greater clarity on the challenges that we face collectively an d individually, and a better understanding of how to begin addressing them.   44. A final thought. In his recent best seller,  \u2018The Ascent of Money\u2019, Niall Ferguson says that sometimes the most important historic al events are the non-events: the things that  15did not occur. The spectacular non-event of this  crisis is that the Great Recession did not turn into the second Great Depression as we had feared. For this central banks should get a part of the credit. But they cannot rest on thei r laurels - they have bi g challenges ahead as the crisis winds down. Their biggest challenge  by far is to regain their credibility.  16", "11 July 20 FSU.pdf": "1  Indian Economy  at a Crossroad : A view from  Financial Stability Angle    Address by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor, Reserve Bank of India  at the 7th SBI Banking  & Economics Conclave organised by the State Bank of India on July 11, 2020     A very warm good morning to you  all. I wish to thank the State Bank of India  for inviting me to deliver the keynote address today . I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the organising  team in putting together this virtual conference which has now become a new normal . Banks and other financial entities are today at the forefront of the country\u2019s counter measures against the economic impact of C OVID -19. They are the transmission channels  for RBI\u2019s monetary, regulatory and other policy measures. They are the implementation vehicles for the financial backstop  measures announced by the government.   2. The outbreak of COVID -19 pandemic is unambiguously the worst health  and economic crisis in the last 100 years during peace time with unprecedented negative consequences for output, jobs and well -being. It has dented the existing world order , global value chains, labour and capital movements across globe and needless to say , the socio -economic conditions of large section of world population.   3. The COVID -19 pandemic, perhaps, represents so-far the biggest test of the robustness and resilience of our economic and financial system. In the extraordinary circumstances that we fac e today, history could provide us with some useful guidance with respect to the role of central banks. Guided by the age -old wisdom summari sed in Bagehot\u2019s 2  dictum1 that ascribes the role of Lender of Last Resort (LOLR) to the central bank, the Reserve Bank  of India has taken a number of important historic measures to protect our financial system and support the real economy in the current crisis. While the eventual success of our policy responses will be known only after some time, they appear to have worke d so far. While reiterating our intent and dedication to steer the economy through the crisis , I would like to highlight certain key aspects of our policy measures .   I. Monetary Policy  Measures  4. Monetary policy was already in an accommodative mode before the outbreak of COVID -19, with a cumulative repo rate cut of 135 basis points between February 2019 and the onset of the pandemic . Reversing the slowdown in growth momentum was the key rationale f or this distinct shift in the stance of monetary policy, even as unseasonal rains caused temporary spikes in food inflation in the second half of 2019 -20. Consistent with this policy stance, liquidity conditions were also kept in ample surplus all through since June 2019.  The lagged impact of these measures was about to propel a cyclical turnaround in economic activity when COVID -19 brought with it calamitous misery, endangering both life and livelihood of people.   5. Given the uncertainty regarding the evolu tion of the COVID curve, it was absolutely critical to anticipate the emerging economic risks and take pro-active monetary policy actions of sizable magnitude, using a comprehensive range of policy instruments to optimise policy traction. The fast-changing  macroeconomic environment and the deteriorating outlook                                                            1 Walter Bagehot (1873),  Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market  (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons)  3  for growth necessitated off -cycle meetings of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) \u2013 first in March and then again in May 2020. The MPC decided to cumulatively cut the policy repo rate by 115 basis po ints over these two meetings, resulting in a total policy rate reduction of 250 basis points  since February 2019.  Liquidity Measures  6. The conventional and unconventional monetary policy and liquidity measures by the Reserve Bank have been aimed at restoring market confidence, alleviating liquidity stress, easing financial conditions, unfreezing credit markets and augmenting the flow of financial resources to those in need for productive purposes . The  broader objective was to mitigate  risks to the gr owth outlook while preserving financial stability. T he liquidity measures announced by the RBI since February 2020 aggregate to about \u20b99.57 lakh crore (equivalent to about 4.7 per cent of 2019 -20 nominal GDP) .  II. Financial Stability and Developmental Measures  7. Heading into the pandemic, the financial system of the country was in a much improved  position , owing mainly to various regulatory and supervisory initiatives of the Reserve Bank. We had put in place a framework for resolution of stressed assets in addition to implementing multiple m easures to strengthen credit discipline and to reduce credit concentration. For the five years between 2015 -16 and 2019 -20, the Government  had infused a total of \u20b9 3.08 lakh crore in public sector banks (PSBs ). As a result of the efforts by both the Reserve Bank and the Government, the overhang of stressed assets in the banking system had  declined and capital position had  improved. As per available numbers (some of which are provisional) at this point of time, the overall capital 4  adequacy ratio for scheduled commercial banks ( SCBs ) stood at 14.8 per cent as in March 2020, compared to 14.3 per cent  in March  2019 . The CRAR of PSBs had improved from 12.2 per cent in March 2019 to 13.0 per cent in  March 2020. The g ross NPA ratio and net NPA r atio of SCBs stood at 8. 3 per cent  and 2.9 per cent i n March 2020, compared to 9. 1 per cent and 3. 7 per cent as on March 2019, respectively. The Provision Covera ge Ratio (PCR) improved from 60.5 per cent in March 2019 to 65.4 per cent in March 2020, indicating higher resiliency in terms of risk absorption capacity. The profitability of SCBs ha d also improved during the year.  The gross and net NPAs of NBFCs stood at 6.4 per cent  and 3.2 per cent  as on March 31, 2020 as against 6.1 per cent  and 3.3 per cent  as on March 31, 2019. The ir CRAR declined marginally from 20. 1 per cent to 19.6 per cent  during 2019 -20.  Supervisory and Regulatory Initiatives  8. An important objective of the Reserve Bank\u2019s supervisory initiative has been to put in place systems and structures to identify, assess and proactively mitigate or manage the vulnerabilities amongst financial institutions. During the last one year, based o n the assessment of events which had the potential to pose a threat to the financial stability, the Reserve Bank has reorganised its regulatory and supervisory functions with an objective of establishing a holistic approach to regulation and supervision. T he unified approach is aimed at addressing the growing size, complexities, and inter -connectedness amongst banks and NBFCs. It is also aimed at effectively addressing potential systemic risks that could arise due to possible supervisory or regulatory arbit rage and information asymmetry. Further, a calibrated approach has been designed to provide the required modularity and scalability to the supervision function to ensure a better focus on the risky institutions and practices; to deploy 5  appropriate range of  tools and technology to achieve the supervisory objectives; and to enhance c apability to conduct horizontal or thematic studies across supervised entities on identified areas of concern. As a fulcrum of the calibrated supervisory approach, the Reserve Bank has strengthened its off -site surveillance mechanism to identity emerging risks and assess the vulnerabilities across the supervised entities for timely action. We are also working towards strengthening the supervisory market intelligence capabilities, w ith the help of both personal and technological intelligence.   9. Specialised handling of weak institutions at the Reserve Bank now helps in closer monitoring and successful resolution of such entities  in a non-disruptive manner. The timely and successful resolution of Yes Bank is an example. After exhausting all possible options  and with a view to safeguard  the interest of the depositors and ensure stability of financial system, we decided to intervene at an appropriate time when the net worth of the bank was still positive.  The Yes Bank reconstruction scheme forged a unique public -private partnership between leading financial entities of India, and it was implemented in a very quick time, which helped the bank\u2019s revival, successfully safeguarded the inter est of the bank\u2019s depositors and ensured financial stability. I wish to compliment the State Bank of India for providing leadership to this initiative. With regard to the Punjab & Maharashtra  Co-operative Bank , the Reserve Bank is engaged with all stakehol ders to find out a workable solution,  as losses are very high, eroding deposits by more than 50 per cent .  10. For NBFCs, active engagement with stakeholders was useful to identify emerging risks and t ake prompt  action.  Considering their increasing size and interconnectedness, the Reserve Bank has taken 6  steps to strengthen the risk management and liquidity management framework of  NBFCs. As you may be aware, NBFCs with a size of more than \u20b95,000 crore have been advised to appoint a functionally independent Chief Risk Officer (CRO) with clearly specified role and responsibilities. Also , government -owned NBFCs have been brought under the Reserve Bank\u2019s on -site inspection framework and off -site surveillance. The amendment to the Reserve Bank of India Act , 1934 effective from August 1, 2019 has  strengthened the ability of Reserve Bank to better regulate and supervise the NBFCs. Besides , some large NBFCs and NBFCs with certain weaknesses are monitored closely on an ongoing basis.   11. In case of the Urban Co -operative Banks (UCBs ), special efforts are being made to move towards a risk -based and pro-active supervisory approac h to identify weaknesses in their operations  early.  An early warning system with a stress -testing framework has been formed  for timely recognition  of weak banks for appropriate action. Formation of an \u2018umbrella organization \u2019, has been approved to provide liquidity, capital, IT and capacity building support t o UCBs. The exposure limits of the UCBs have been brought down to reduce credit concentration and the priority sector targets have been revised substantially upwards so that UCBs remain focused on their core segment - i.e., micro and small borrowers. The r ecent amendments in the Reserve Bank of India Act,  1934 and the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 will facilitate our supervision processes with respect to NBFCs and UCBs, respectively.   Response to the Pandemic  12. As a part of response to the pandemic, the RBI has undertaken a series of measures which are already in the public domain. Besides, the 7  Reserve Bank\u2019s  focus was also to ensure that the contingency response to COVID -19 was implemented by all regulated entities swiftly to minimise  disruptions. Accordingly, right from the onset of the crisis, the policy measures were aimed at operational issues, and in particular , ensuring business continuity and unhindered operations of the financial market infrastructure. The Reserve Bank activated an elaborate business continuity plan for its own operations as well as ensured that banks also activate their own business continuity plans. We advised all banks on 16th March, 2020 to take stock of critical processes  and revisit their Business Continuity Plan (BCP) . All entities were also advised to assess the impact of COVID -19 on their balance sheet, asset quality and liquidity , and take immediate contingency measures to manage the ir risks.   13. As the lock -down has obstructed our on- site supervisory examination to an extent, we are further enhancing our off -site surveillance mechanism. The objective of the off -site surveillance system would be to \u2018smell the distress\u2019 , if any , and be able to initi ate pre -emptive actions. This requires use of market i ntelligence inputs and  on-going engagements with financial institutions  on potential vulnerabilities. The off-site assessment framework, which takes into account macro and micro variables, is more analy tical and forward looking and aimed at identifying vulnerable sectors, borrowers as well as supervised entities.   14. While the multipronged approach adopted by the Reserve Bank has provided a cushion from the immediate impact of the pandemic on banks, the medium -term outlook is uncertain and depends on the COVID -19 curve. Policy action for the medium -term would require a careful assessment of how the crisis unfolds. Building buffers and raising capital will be crucial not only to ensure credit flow but also to build resilience in 8  the financial system.   We have recently (19th June and 1st July, 2020) advised all banks , non-deposit taking NBFCs (with an asset size of \u20b95,000 crore ) and all deposit -taking NBFCs to assess the impact of COVID-19 on their balance sheet, asset quality, liquidity, profitability and capital adequacy for the financial year 2020 -21.  Based on t he outcome of such stress testing , banks and non -banking financial companies have been advised to work out possible mitigating measures including capital planning,  capital raising, and contingency liquidity planning,  among others . The idea is to ensure continued credit supply to  different sectors of the economy  and maintain financial stability .   III. Major Challenges   15. Going forward,  there are certain stress points in the financial system, which w ould require constant  regulatory and policy attention to mitigate the risks. The economic impact of the pandemic - due to lock -down and anticipated post  lock-down compression in economic growth - may result in higher non -performing assets and capital erosion of banks.  A recapitalisation plan for PSBs and private banks ( PVBs ) has, therefore,  become necessary . While  the NBFC sector as a whole may still look resilient, the redemption pressure on NBFCs and mutual funds need close monitoring.  Mutual funds have emerged as major investors in market instruments issued by NBFCs, which is why the development of an adverse feedback loop and the associated systemic risk warrants timely and targeted policy interventions. Increasing share of bank lendi ng to NBFCs and the continuing crunch in market -based financing faced by the NBFCs and  Housing Finance Companies ( HFCs ) also need to be watched carefully.   9  16. The global financial crisis of 2008-09 and the COVID -19 pandemic have dispelled the notion that tail  risks to the financial system will materialise only rarely. The probability distribution of risk events has much fatter tails than we think. Shocks to the financial system dubbed as \u2018once in a lifetime events\u2019 seem to be more frequent than  even  \u2018once in a  decade\u2019. Accordingly, the minimum capital requirements of banks, which are calibrated based on historical loss events, may no longer be considered  sufficient enough to absorb the losses. Meeting the minimum capital requirement is necessary, but not a suff icient condition for financial stability. Hence, it is imperative that the approach to risk management in banks should be in tune with the realisation of more frequent, varied  and bigger risk events than in the past. Banks have to remember the old saying that care and diligence bring luck. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, being caught unprepared in the face of a shock may be regarded as a misfortune, but to be caught unawares more th an once may be a sign of carelessness2.  17. Notwithstanding the numerous steps already taken, there is always room for improvement to address several issues that may emerge in the medium to long-term. These issues are as common to NBFCs and other financial in termediaries as they are to banks. The supervisory approach of the Reserve Bank is to further strengthen its focus on developing financial institutions\u2019 ability to identify, measure, and mitigate the risks . The new supervisory approach will be two -pronged  - first, strengthening  the internal defenses of the supervised entities ; and second, greater  focus on identifying the early warning signals and initiate corrective action.                                                             2  The original quote comes from a play titled the Importance of Being Earnest  written by Oscar Wilde  10  18. To strengthen the internal defenses, higher emphasis is now being  given on  causes of weaknesses than on symptoms. The symptoms of weak banks are usually poor asset quality, lack of profitability, loss of capital, excessive leverage, excessive risk exposure, poor conduct, and liquidity concerns. These different symptoms often eme rge together. The causes of weak financial institutions can usually be traced to one or more of the following conditions: inappropriate business model , given the business environment ; poor or inappropriate governance and assurance functions ; poor decision making by senior management ; and misalignment of internal incentive structures with external stakeholder interests3.  19. We are placing special emphasis on the assessment of business model, governance and assurance functions (compliance, risk management and i nternal audit functions), as these have been the areas of heightened supervisory concern . Supervised entities generally tend to focus more on business aspects even to the detriment of governance aspects and assurance functions. There was also an apparent disconnect between their articulated business strategy and actual business operations. The  thrust of the approach, therefore is, to improve the risk, compliance, and governance culture amongst the financial institutions. In this regard, the Reserve Bank has released a discussion paper on \u201cGovernance in Commercial Banks in India\u201d with the object ive to align the current regulatory framework with global best practices while being mindful of the context of the domestic financial system. The main emphasis of the discussion paper is to encourage separation of ownership                                                            3 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (July 2015): Guidelines for identifying and dealing with weak banks .   11  from management - while owners f ocus on the return on their investment, the management should focus on protecting the interest of all stakeholders . The Board , on its part , should set the culture and values of the organization; recognis e and manage conflicts of interest; set the appetite for risk and manag e risks within that appetite;  exercise oversight of senior management; and empower the oversight and assurance functions through various interventions. The Reserve Bank will extend these principles of good governance to large- sized NBFCs in due course .   IV. The Way Forward  20. Despite the substantial impact of pandemic in our daily lives, the financial system of the country, including all the payment systems  and financial markets , are functioning without any hindrance. T he Indian economy has started showing signs of getting back to normalcy in response to the staggered easing of restrictions. It is , however,  still uncertain when supply chains will be restored fully ; how long will it take  for demand conditions to normalise ; and what kind of durable e ffects the pandemic will leave behind on our  potential growth. Targeted and comprehensive reform measures already announced by the Government should help in supporting the country\u2019s potential growth. Possibly in a vastly differen t post -COVID global environment, reallocation of factors of productions within the economy and innovative ways of expanding economic activity could lead to some rebalancing and emergence of new growth drivers. The policy measures, i.e., monetary, fiscal, r egulatory and structural reforms , provide the enabling conditions for a speedier recovery in economy activity while minimis ing near -term disruptions.    12  21. The need of the hour is to restore confidence, preserve financial stability, revive growth and recover stronger. A t the central bank , we strive to maintain the balance between preserving financial stability, maintaining banking system soundness and sustaining economic activity. Post containment of COVID -19, a very careful trajectory has to be followed in orderly unwinding of counter -cyclical regulatory measures and the financial sector should return to normal func tioning without relying on the regulatory relaxations as the new norm . The Reserve Bank is making continuous assessment of the changing trajectory of financial stability risks and upgrading its own supervisory framework to ensure that financial stability is preserved . Banks and f inancial intermediaries have to be ever vigilant and substantially upgrade their capabilities with respect to governance, a ssurance functions and risk culture .   22. It is true that the pandemic poses a challenge of epic proportio ns; however, human grit - manifesting through collective efforts, intelligent choices, and innovation - will tremendously help us to come out of the present crisis. Mahatma Gandhi  had said, \u201c \u2026the future depends on what you do today \u201d. I have presented a bird\u2019s eye view of the resolutions that the Reserve Bank has taken currently to combat this unprecedented situation. I am confident that these will comp lement the measures undertaken  by the Government in achieving our policy objectives .   Along with the tireless efforts of thousands of people and the undying spirit of our populace, I am optimistic that  these policy actions will yield desired results. Thes e trying times will only strengthen world\u2019s faith in the resilience of our economy. We shall prove this together.   Thank you.  **********  ", "5 June 08 MP.pdf": "Agriculture: Emerging Issues and Possible Approaches\u2217  His Excellency, the Governor of Andhra Pradesh and the Chancellor of Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University (ANGRAU), Shri Narayan Datt Ti wari garu; Vice Chancellor, ANGRAU, Dr. P. Raghava Reddy garu; Members of the Board of Management of ANGRAU; Registrar of ANGRAU; Horticultural University Vice Chancellor, Dr. S.D. Sikhamani garu; Members of the Academic Council of Agriculture and Home Science Faculties; dear students and staff of this university, respected parents, distinguished guests, media personnel, ladies and gentlemen.   It is an honour and privilege for me to be with you on this memorable occasion. This is a convocation address, no doubt, but it is also an occasion to dedicate my address to the memory of Acharya N.G. Ranga garu. His views on political economy and agriculture have acquired great relevance and special significance in today\u2019s turbulent world of high food prices and focus on farmers\u2019 well-being. You, my young friends, will have a critical role in resolving the emerging issues relating to agriculture, both in India and globally.  Acharya N.G. Ranga, who was educated in prestigious institutions in the United Kingdom and was a Professor of Economics at Pachaiyappa\u2019s College in Ma dras University, entered the Guinness Book of World Records as a Parliamentarian with fifty years of service in legislative bodies. He was a leading freedom fighter of national stature and a great propounder, of intern ational stature, of the im portance of peasantry and agricultural labour. His beliefs led him to found the Bh arat Krishikar Lok Party and the Swatantra Party along with Rajaji, which frowned upon the permit-licence Raj. The economic reforms in India since 1991 have served us well and these have, in many ways, followed one of Professor Ranga\u2019s suggestions namely \u2018liberalisation\u2019. However, only recently we have commenced realising the significance of peasantry and rural labour that he had recognised decades ago. We now realise how critical the situation in regard to agriculture, in particular food prices, is to all sections of the people, all over the world. In fact, it is uppermost in the current agenda of central banks around the world in the context of price stability and inflation expectations. I believe that the distinguished faculty and the knowledgeable students of this university would appreciate the contemporary relevance of Professor Ranga\u2019s ideas and they will commit to play a historic role in resolving the issues that confront us today.                                              \u2217 40th Convocation Address of the Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University, Hyderabad by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India, on June 5, 2008  2 At the outset, my hearty congratulations are due to the Graduating Class of 2008, who would be receiving their hard earned degrees and awards. I also compliment the staff members who have received awards and the entire faculty for their efforts in imparting high quality education and inculcating good values to shape the personalities of our young generation. It is th e endeavour of the students and the staff, I understand, that helped this agricultural university in winning the ICAR \u2019s Best Agricultural Institute Award two times in quick succession and also the ICAR Best Performance Award of Students in the ICAR All India Competitive Examinations twice in the last few years. Dear new graduates, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has an important stake in the subjects that you have been trained in. Our main objectives relate to maintaining price stability and aid the process of generating output and employment. Agricultural prices are really cr itical for the household budgets of about a billion people in our country. About sixty per cent of our work force in India is dependent upon agriculture and related activities. Though most policy issues in this regard fall within the domain of governments and universities like yours, the RBI has to monitor the developments and aid public policy through the financial system \u2013 especially in terms of price stability, financial stability, financia l inclusion and credit delivery. In this background, while there are many issues in agriculture, I will confine to a fe w. I will briefly explore the serious problem of food that is confronting the world today. This is followed by a narration of the Indian situation. In particular RBI\u2019s approach to agriculture is described.  Food Prices as a global issue In recent months, there has been a phenomenal increase in food prices globally. To illustrate, while the global food price index rose on average by 10.5 per cent in calendar year 2006 and by 15.2 per cent in 2007, it has increased by a substantial 40.8 per cent in the first four months of 2008 compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), 37 countries in the world are presently facing food crisis, 31 of which are in Africa and Asia. Last week (end of May) the World Bank unveiled a US$ 1.2 billion fast track funding facility to help combat the impact of rising food prices on the poor. World leaders are currently (June 3-5 in Rome) meeting for a High-Level Conference on World Food Security hosted by FAO. The summit comes at a time when food prices have registered an increase of 55 per cent, in the last twelve months. The agenda for the summit includes measures relating to augmenting crop production, trade, aid, diversion to bio fuels and increasing investment in agriculture science and technology. The overall purpose of the High-Level Conference is to address food security issues in the face of soaring food prices and the new challenges of climate change and energy security. The objective of the Conference is to  3assist countries and the international community in devising sustainable solutions to the food crisis by identifying the policies, strategies and programmes required  to safeguard world food security in the immediate, short and longer term.  Undoubtedly, the current global food situation is very serious and hence, we need to understand the reasons for such dramatic increase in food prices in a short period.   First, it is said that rapid growth of China and India is lifting standards of living of millions of people every year thus putting enormous pressure on global demand. It is also argued that the food basket has changed and is contributing to higher demand. However, a closer scrutiny would reveal that enhanced demand cannot explain a sudden spurt in prices in one year since these two economies have been growing at elevated and accelerating levels for over a decade, if not over two decades. Further, China has been a net wheat exporter and its per capita meat consumption had reached western standards by 2005. India is an exporter or an importer at the margin, except in regard to vegetable edible oils where it has been a consistent net importer in recent years, and also to a small extent in regard to pulses. Second, the drought conditions, possibly induced by climate change, in some countries like Australia and Ukraine, may provide some explanation for price incr eases. It is also likely that dwindling stock levels observed in several countries could have exacerbated the scarcity conditions. Further, administrative measures in some countries to restrict or discourage exports of  food products might have stabilised prices in those countries but could have enhanced the prices in some other countries. However, these reasons do not fully explain the widespread global increases in prices of all the commodities at the same time. Third, it is argued that increases in energy costs are resulting in cost push inflation but contribution of energy costs to overall costs in agriculture may not explain the huge increase in food-prices.  Fourth, related to the current elevated energy prices, there has been diversion of corn and edible oils to bio-fuels, which are significantly influenced by policy mandates. Very clearly this diversion to bio-fuel is a policy induced new reality which coincided with price escalation in precisely those products and hence, is noteworthy.   4  Fifth, the financialisation of commodity trade and current extraordinary conditions in global financial markets could have influenced the spurt in prices. The recent reductions in interest rates in the U.S. and the injection of liquidity have resulted in investors seeking new avenues such as commodity markets, in view of the turbulence in financial markets and the low returns in treasuries. The relatively easy liquidity and low interest rates, by themselves, make holding of  inventories attractive and thus i nduce greater volatility to commodity markets. The weakening of the U.S. dollar is also advanced as a reason for the recent volatility in commodity markets, including food items. It is evident that this phenomenon is also now coinciding with the across-the-board rise in food prices.  In brief, while there are demand and supply side pressures on food items, there is considerable merit in the arguments that recent extraordinary increases in food prices are closely linked to the public policy responses to high energy costs in advanced economies, and the turbulence in financial markets and financial institutions. It is said that the impact of such policy indu ced diversion of food to bio-fuels is significant at this juncture and reflects a preference to fill the fuel tan ks of automobiles rather than fill the empty stomachs of people. Similarly, it is sometimes held that the weight accorded to financial stability in public policy may now be at the expense of stability in real sector \u2013 especially of  sensitive commodities like fo od. At the same time, there is a general consensus that public policies in regard to food in many economies around the world have not provided adequate incentives to farmers to increase the supply of food and other agricultural products to comfortably match the growing demand over the medium term.   As regards prospects for the near future, there are severe imponderables, especially relating to the path of future prices of oil; progress in restoration of normalcy in financial markets, especially currency markets; and the extent of slow down in the U.S. economy an d its consequential impact on the world economy as a whole. Further, public policies in regard to food, especially diversion to bio-fuel; cross border trading; subsidies; and replenishment or use of buffer stocks; would impact the evolution of prices globally. However, the redeeming feature is that supply response in regard to food grains is possible in a year or two. As per FAO estimates, wheat output is set to achieve a new record in 2008, though against the backdrop of deeply depleted stocks. Global production of rice in 2008 is expected to be marginally better than the previous year and hence, some depletion of stocks held may be expected. Global output of edible oil is anticipated to fall by about three per cent in the current year, and according to FAO, oil seeds and edible oil prices are expected to remain firm.   5 What is the medium term to long term outlook for food prices at the global level? According to the Agricultural Outlook from OECD and FAO, while agricultural commodity prices should ease from their recent record peaks, they are expected to average well above their mean level of the past decade. Two days ago (June 3rd) U.N. Secretary-General said, in a speech at the High-Level Conference on World Food Security hosted by FAO that world food output needs to rise by 50 per cent by 2030 to meet rising demand.  The implications of such a scenario in global farm outputs and prices for us should be very clear. With rapid economic growth in our country, the food-consumpti on will rise in an unprecedented fashion since we are over a billion people. The food basket will also change. We have to augment food supplies within the country since marginal requirements or even a perception of shortfalls in domestic supply in our economy can have significant influence on world prices. As we have over half of the work force depending on agriculture, and as we have scope for increasing productivity in agriculture, there is no reason why we cannot ensure food security for our country, at a minimum. Indeed, India can become the \u2018Annapoorna\u2019 for the world and I feel that Andhra Pradesh can become the \u2018Annapoorna\u2019 for India.   In this regard, I can do no better than quote Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, one of our esteemed agricultural scientists, \u201cIndia has the technological an d economic capability to demonstrate how farming system can be adjusted to different weather patterns. It is hoped that at the Rome Conference, Indian representatives will serve as a bright affirming flame in the midst of the sea of despair we see around us\u201d. Indian situation  Let us now focus on the Indian situation. At the outset, it must be recognised that increase in food prices in India in recent months has been only a fraction of that observed in many other countries. In particular, the global prices of wheat and rice had almost doubled between January and April 2008, while in India the increase has been far less than one tenth of that. In a sense, this vindicates the long-standing public policy of emphasis on a degree of food security in our country, especially due to the vulnerability of large segments of the population. Yet, the prices of food articles spurted in India also in 2006 and 2007. The average annual increase in the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) of food articles was around 7.0 per cent during that period. While increase in the food prices was led by wheat (13.0 per cent) during 2006, rice (6.0 per cent) and edible oil (13.1 per cent) also joined in the price rise in 2007. However, food prices have exhibited some moderation during 2008. The Wholesale Price Index of food articles during 2008-09 (up to May 17, 2008) has increased by around 2.5 per cent as compared with the corresponding period (3.1 per cent) in the previous year.   6 Of greater interest may be the current outlook for individual commodities, which appears positive for wheat, with significant improvement in procurement. In regard to rice production which stagnated since mid-90s, some turnaround is observed since 2005-06. The prices of edible oil increased sharply in 2006-07 and spiked during 2007-08. However, some moderation has been observed during the current financial year so far. Due to stagnant levels of production in pulses the demand-supply gap is met through imports, but domestic prices saw a spurt before seeing a decline during the last one year. Prospects for sugar, of which India is amongst the largest producers, appear bright for the current year, since production has risen substantially since 2005-06.  Overall, some abatement of global prices, indication of better domestic supplies and addition to our buffer stocks, along with the series of measures already taken by the government, on the supply side, are expected to yield results in the months to come. Over the medium term, however, the National Food Security Mission launched about two years ago should yield positive results.  RBI\u2019s approach to Agriculture  RBI\u2019s major objectives are to maintain price stability and maintain growth momentum, especially employment generation. In this endeavour, agriculture pl ays a critical role since agricultural commodities have a relatively significant weight in price indices in our country and also in anchoring inflation expectations. In terms of employment also agriculture dominates, accounting  for about sixty per cent of the total, while in terms of GDP its share is less than a third of that. However, the policy space available to RBI is basically confined to managing aggregate demand through appropriate stance in regard to growth in money supply, interest and exchange rates and, to some extent, flow of credit thro ugh banks. Yet, in view of the criticality of agriculture, RBI articulates its approaches to agriculture through the Annual Reports. Let me summarise briefly, the analysis and the views as expressed by the Directors of the RBI in their Annual Reports during the recent past \u2013 say last five years. (a) Since the mid-1990s, the growth of the agricultural sector has not only been low, but also volatile. The crop yields have shown an unstable trend in recent years. An area of growing concern has been the continued incidence of localised droughts even in good monsoon years. In recent years, the food consumption basket is getting diversified towards value added food products such as meat, poultry, fish, vegetables and fruits. It is important for production to respond to these shifts in consumption.  7(b) The share of agriculture in the total gross capital formation (GCF) in real terms has been declining in recent years mainly on account of steady erosion in the share of public investment. The inadequacy of private investment in fulfilling the capita l requirements of agriculture has raised concerns about the state of the rural infrastructure, which coul d turn into a binding constraint on growth.  (c) Several initiatives have been taken in recent years to improve the agricultural credit delivery mechanism. However, some bottlenecks continue to affect the flow of credit to agriculture. To attain a higher growth in agriculture, the major areas requiring attention in the financial sector are, inter alia , spread of insurance against crop losses and facilities for meeting the needs of the rural economy. Newer forms of credit assessment and risk management systems may also have to be put in place, besides upgrading skills, and ushering in changes in attitudes and mind-sets. In formation technology has to be used to facilitate transformation in various processes of rural credit. (d) Efficient and well developed agricultural markets are necessary to enable farmers to deal with inherent risks associated with the perishability of their produce, to get remunerative prices, and to secure smooth access to input supplies. Towards these objectives, the agricultural marketing system in the country needs to be integrated and strengthened. Given the several risks that farmers face, such as future price and monsoon conditions, there is a need to put in place appropiate risk mitigation policies. Accordingly, a comprehensive public policy on risk management in agriculture could promote a more efficient and commercialised agriculture that could also provide relief to the distressed farmers. Rural infrastructure, which includes agriculture research and extension, transport, electricity, and storage structures, not only enhances the productivity of physical resources, but also helps in supply chain management and value addition in agriculture.  (e) Greater focus needs to be placed on agricultural research in the coming years as the success so far has been restricted to select crops. Efforts to modernise and strengthen the agricultural research system, including the agricultural universities, need to be intensified. The Green Revolution has been the cornerstone of India\u2019s agricultural development, transforming the c ountry from one of food deficiency to self-sufficiency. The time is now ripe for a second Green Revolution wh ich will lay emphasis on dive rsifying the agricultural sector further in order to capture new market opportunities.  8  As regards flow of credit, in which RBI has a role primarily as the regulator of banking system, it has been the RBI\u2019s endeavour to enhance credit flow to agriculture by removing the bottlenecks in credit delivery. The RBI, on its part, is intensifying  efforts in revitalising the rural cooperative credit system, strengthening regional rural banks, providing incentives to commercial banks for investments in rural economy and ensuring an adequate and timely delivery of credit at a reasonable  price. The programme for financial inclusion initiated by the RBI in collaboration with banks and several State Governments, by adopting modern technology, is being intensified and expanded.  Andhra Pradesh   Before concluding this section on India and RBI, let me hasten to add that Andhra Pradesh has shown a visionary leadership by putting irrigation and agricult ure at the top of agenda for public policy. Andhra Pradesh has anticipated the emerging criticality of agriculture and designed a policy that is now being followed by many other states in India. RBI has been having the privilege of very close cooperation and coordination with the Government of Andhra Pradesh. Conclusion  Let me conclude by reiterating that globally demand for agricultural products will be very high for the next two to three decades. India will play a dominant role in contributing to both global demand and global supply. Agriculture will be increasingly more diversified an d not confined to food crops. Scientific agriculture is and will be the key for the future. The path ahead is far fr om smooth, and traversing this path requires constant efforts, vigilance and dedication. I am sure that the knowledge gained from your education will help you in moving forward in your endeavours in life, with determination and confidence. My dear young graduates in agriculture and horticulture, you have a bright \u2013 a very bright \u2013 future since India, indeed, the world beckons you. Make the best  of it by working hard and purposefully and at the same time being happy. Remember, the ultimate goal is  your happiness and the final judge of how you achieve it is your own conscience.  I pray that your continuing commitment to the cause of agriculture will be an inspiration and a matter of pride to the future generations.  Thank you.

The subj ect of the present seminar is  extremely important at the present stage of Indian economic development. This three-day seminar I am sure, will provide useful insights into various issues relevant for policy-making to guide India successfully through paradigm search and paradigm shift. There are divergent views on theme of the present seminar and I believe the illustrious scholars participating in this seminar will touch upon them. The seminar would provide an important outlet for sharing and discussing rich experiences on such a relevant topic.  I congratulate the Humanities and Social Sciences Department of IIT Bombay for organizing this seminar on an important topic.   The reform process of the mid-1980s and 1990s has been successful in gradually establishing the pre-conditions for smooth functioning of the market. However, c oncurrently, the Eight, Ninth and Tenth five year plans provided the overall direction to the economy. The outcome of such an experience has been encouraging on several fronts though there exist a large unfinished agenda. On the positive side, the Indian economy has entered a high growth phase since 2003-04 breaking the lacklustre performance what late Prof. Raj Krishna described by the catchy phrase \"the Hindu rate of growth\". While the real GDP growth for the Tenth Plan period (2002-03 to 2006-07) averaged 7.6 per cent per annum, during 2005-06 and 2006-07, the growth rate has been above 9.0 per cent level. The major issue facing the Indian economy at this point is whether this high growth phase can be sustained. It is in this context that the debate on planning versus  decentralization versus  market becomes crucial.  One thing is very clear that right combination of strategy would be requir ed to steer India through from a developing economy to a developed economy.   Rethinking on economic policy in India has not been an exclusive and distinct process, but has been derived from the international thinking. The broad outline of the reforms that were initiated in the mid-1980s was not very different from the reforms undertaken by many deve loping countries around that time. The limitations of a development strategy based on import substitution, public sector dominance and extensive Government control over the private sector had become evident by then, and there was no choice other than changing the system itself in a fundamental way. The broad characteristics of the system change involved liberalisation of Government controls, a larger role for the private sector and greater integration with the world economy. India\u2019s reforms differed from rest of the world in that it was implemented at a much more gradual pace keeping in view the Indian context and Indian specific circumstances, and the gradualism strategy paid off in warding off any financial crisis of sorts witnessed in East Asian economies or Latin American economies.                                                1 Inaugural Address by Smt. Shyamala Gopinath, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at a seminar at the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai on January 21, 2008. Assistance of Dr. G.S. Bhati, Anupam Prakash and Snehal Herwadkar in preparing the speech is gratefully acknowledged.               2          After giving a historical background of planning in India, I would touch upon the policy changes as a part of the structural reforms in different sectors of the Indian economy. I would also review the achievements in terms of the performance of the economy in the post-reform period. The concluding observations would delineate some of the challenges that lie ahead.    I. Historical Background   The Planning Commission was set up in March 1950 with the objectives of promoting a rapid increase in the standard of living of the people by efficient exploitation of the resources of the country, increasing production and offering opportunities to all for employment in the service of the community. The Planning Commission was entrusted with the responsibility of making assessment of all resources of the country, augmenting deficient resources, formulating plans for the most effective and ba lanced utilisation of resources and determining priorities. The evolution of India's development policy over the past fi fty years is a unique illustration of change with continuity \u2013 though the underlying objective has been the same, the emphasis of each plan varied in accordance with the evolving situation. During the first three Five Year Plans India's process of development consists  of the following three elements: (a) modernization of the economy; (b) self-reliance; and (c) socialism or, more correctly a socialist pattern of society with equity and social justice. For the following two decades, policies were adjusted to the changes in the objective conditions of the economy. For the first eight plans, the emphasis was on a growing public sector with massive investments in basic and heavy industries. Among the prominent features of public policy, licensing regulated the scale of operations of ev ery firm; reservations and other incentives favoured small-scale industries; strict labour laws constrained large enterprises; and the MRTP Act was the final safeguard against concentration. In short, private initiative and growth, were to that extent st ymied although it has to be accepted that the impressive growth performance since 1990s was possible due to the strong foundation of an industrial base and the knowledge enhancing institutions. Since the launch of the Ninth Plan in 1997, the emphasis on the public sector has become less pronounced and the current thinking on planning in the country, in general, is that it should increasingly be of an indicative nature.  II. Economic Reforms of the 1990s  The economic reforms of the 1990s included: significant industrial and trade liberalization; financial deregulation; improvements in supervisory and regulatory systems; and policies more conducive to privatization and foreign direct investment. One of the major initiatives in the reforms spectrum was in the area of industrial and trade policy. Industrial Reforms The pre-liberalisation industrial policy was characterise d by several restrictions on private investment on subjects like, areas allowed for investment, scale of operations, location of new investment and even the technology to be used. As a result, the Indian industrial structure was highly inefficient as documented by a number of empirical studies. In order to protect this inefficient industrial structure, the trade policy necessarily had to be restrictive and protective. Considering all the costs these restrictive po licies inflicted on the economy, there was a near consensus amongst economists and policy makers about the need for reforms in the industrial sector.    3Before the reforms, around 18 industries were reserved for sole operation by the public sector.  This list has been reduced over the period and at present only three industries - defence aircrafts and warships, atomic energy generation and railway transport, are reserved for the public sector. Another major area of reforms was the industrial licensing. Currently industrial licensing by the Central Government is restricted only for a few hazardous and environmentally sensitive areas. The MRTP Act has been diluted. The list of items reserved for production by the small scale sector has been pruned substantially. Some of the most crucial items which were removed from the reservation list included highly export-oriented items like garments, shoes, toys and auto components.  Trade and Investment Reforms  Prior the reforms, the trade policy was characterised by high tariff and pervasive import restrictions.  Import of manufacturing commodities was completely banned. In order to import capital goods, raw materials and intermediaries, where indigenous substitutes were available, licenses were required. This made imports not only cumbersome and time consuming, but also resulted in inefficient industrial production as mentioned earlier. The aim of reforms in the trade policy was to phase out import lice nsing and rationalisation of import duties. The requirements of import license for capital goods and intermediaries were relaxed as early as 1993. Removal of restrictions on import of manufactured consumer goods and agricultural products was a more lengthy process as the number of domestic producers affected by this change was large. The quantitative restrictions on imports of manufactured consumer goods were finally removed in 2001.   Prior to 1991, there were several restrictions on fore ign direct investment in India, making it almost impossible for foreign entities to operate in India or collaborate with Indian companies. There was a growing understanding that liberalisation was needed on this front in order to increase the total volume of investment in the economy, improve production technology, increase access to world market and also improve efficiency in the domestic production processes by introducing an element of competition. Owing to the reforms in this direction, 100 per cent/majority foreign ownership is now allowed in a number of industries with a few exceptions.    Procedures for obtaining permission were greatly simplified by listing in dustries that are eligible for automatic approval up to specified level of foreign equity (100 per cent, 74 per cent and 51 per cent). In order to get the required permission, the foreign investors only need to register with the Reserve Bank. In case of foreign direct investment in areas other than that covered by the automatic route list and also in case higher than automatically permitted investment proposals, the interested parties are required to go through the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. Since 1993, investments in Indian equities by Foreign Institutional Inve stors (FIIs) are permitted and presently the FIIs as a class has become a dominant player in the Indian stock markets. The reforms in trade and industrial policy had a deep rooted impact on the industrial sector in India. The Indian companies became more efficient thanks to the competitive pressures. The domestic players reaped the benefits of upgraded technology and expanded to more efficient scales of production to withstand the competitive pressure. Many domestic players also had to restructure their business activities through mergers and acquisitions. Others refocused their business strategies to concentrate on their areas of core competency.   4Infrastructure Reforms  Rapid growth of the economy can be sustained only if there are no infrastructural bottlenecks. In fact, infrastructural facilities like electricity and telecommunications, connectivity through water, roads, railways and air transportation, are the backbone of an emerging economy.   The State Governments have taken some initiatives by instituting independent statutory regulators, which are expected to set tariffs at a level which is fair to both consumers and producers. Privatization of power distribution has also been affected by some states, though implementation of these reforms has been met with some resistance. Comparatively, India\u2019s performance in the telecommunication sector is much better. There are several private sector service providers operating in fixed line and cellular services. As a result, while the tele-density has improved substantially over the period, waiting period to get new connections has come down drastically. The most striking impact was on the long distance charges, which have been reduced substantially. In the case of civil aviation, the entry of private players has introduced competition and this has resulted in lowering tariff rates across the spectrum. While there have been some remarkable initiatives in the case of road transport, the railways have also witnessed winds of change in recent years. Tariffs have been rationalised and newer avenues of earning revenue are being explored extensively.  Agricultural Reforms  As compared with the industrial policy and trade policy, the reforms in agricultural sector were slow. Some economists have suggested that the reform process indirect ly benefitted the agricultural sector as the reduction in protection to industry and the accompanying depreciation in exchange rate titled the relative prices in favour of agriculture and agricultural exports. The Government stepped up efforts to improve agricultural productivity through regionally differentiated strategies under the macro mana gement mode of planning and implementation, introduced in October 2000, subsuming all earlier Centrally Sponsored Schemes. Agriculture has, however, suffered due to decline in public investment in areas which are crucial for agricultural growth, viz., irrigation, soil conservation, water management and rural roads. Some studies have suggested that this decline in public investment was more than offset by the increase in private investment in agriculture. However, the fact remains that initiatives which can kick-start the growth process are likely to be undertaken only by the public sector. Thus a lot remains to be done in the area of agricultural reforms.   5Financial Sector Reforms  Financial sector reforms, which are an important institutional underpinning for real sector reforms, have also made considerable progress. A modern and efficient financial system is necessary not only to provide a conducive environment for private saving, but also to ensure that these are channelled into the most productive investment opportunities. The principal objective of financial sector reforms was to improve the allocative efficiency of resources, ensure financial stability and maintain confidence in the financial system by enhancing its soundness and efficiency . At the same time, reforms were also undertaken in various segments of financial markets, to enable the banking sector to perform its intermediation role in an efficient manner. With a view to making the reform measures mutually reinforcing, the reform process was carried forward through analysis and recommendations by various Committees/Working Groups and extensive consultations with experts and market participants. One of the special features of the reforms was that these were carefully sequenced in terms of instruments and objectives. Thus, prudential norms were introduced early in the reform cycle, followed by interest rate deregulation and gradually lowering of statutory preemptions. The more complex aspects of legal and accounting measures were ushered in subsequently when the basic tenets of the reforms were already in place. While the focus of the first generation of reforms was to create an efficient, productive and profitable financial services industry, the second phase of financial sector reforms, beginning from the second-half of the 1990 s, was aimed at strengthening of the financial system and bringing of structural improvements.    The need to prepare the financial system in a more gl obalised environment and to promote financial stability in the face of domestic and external shocks was on the top of agenda of reforms. With increasing globalisation of the Indian economy, the reform process witnessed a significant move towards adoption of international best practices in several crucial areas of importance such as prudential norms, banking supervision, data dissemination and corporate governance. The desired reforms to align with what are considered appropriate global practices, in financial sector, in terms of timing and redesigning to suit our conditions must recognise the status and developments in the real sector, especially flexibilities, fiscal health and overall governance standards.   With a view to increasing competition in the banking sector, new private sector banks were licensed. A prerequisite for grant of the licence was that these banks had to be fully automated from day one. The results are self-evident as these banks have become high-tech banks. This has had a 'demonstration' effect on the entire system. The Government ownership in nationalised and Stat e Bank of India was brought down by allowing them to raise capital from the equity market up to 49/45 per cent of  paid-up capital. A unique feature of the reform of public sector banks, which dominated the Indian banking sector, was the process of financial restructuring. Banks were recapitalised by the Government to meet prudential norms through recapitalisation bonds. The mechanism of hiving-off bad loans to a separate government asset management company was not considered appropriate in view of the moral hazard. The overhang of non-performing loans had to be managed.  The divestment of equity and offer to private shareholders was undertaken through a public offer and not by sale to strategic investors. Consequently, all the public sector banks, which issued shares to private shareholders, have been listed on the exchanges and are subject to the same disclosure and market discipline standards as other listed entities. Banks were also allowed to diversify into various financial services and are now offering  a whole range of financial products like universal banks.   6 Active steps were also taken to improve the institutional arrangements, including the legal framework and technological system what is referred to as financial ecology. To tackle the issue of high level of non-performing assets (NPAs), Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) were established consequent to the passing of Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993. To prov ide a significant impetus to banks to ensure sustained recovery, the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act was passed in 2002. While transfer of NPAs of public sector banks to separate asset management companies was not considered, an institutional mechanism to deal with distressed assets of banks and financial institutions has been created. Asset Reconstruction Companies have been allowed to be set up which are in the private sector and operate as independent commercial entities to acquire non-performing assets from any financial entity and restructure and rehabilitate or liquidate them with in a definite time frame. This has created a market for distressed assets in India.   The Government securities, money and forex markets have significant public policy implications for an emerging market economy. These have developed during t he reform period with impressive diversification of participants and instruments.   The smooth functioning of the payment and settlement system is a pre-requisite for financial stability. The introduction of Real-time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system   and setting up of the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) which acts as a central counterparty for securities and forex transactions and guarantees both the securities and funds legs of the transaction have enhanced  the efficiency and stability of  the payments mechanism.   There has been a constant rebalancing of reform priorities predicated upon the domestic and global business environment, institution of prudential practices, upgradation of the regulatory and supervisory framework, institution of appropriate institutional and legal reforms an d the state of openness of the economy. In retrospect, the key success of financial sector reforms in India since they were instituted in the early 1990s has been the maintenance of financial stability through a period marked by  repeated financial crises across the world. The process of reforms is noteworthy not only for the absence of turbulence in its path but also for the sheer dimensions of the change achieved from the position where we started.  III. Impact of Economic Reforms of the 1990s       These changes introduced across several sectors of the economy gave a sharp boost to growth. The impressive growth performance since 1990s was possible due to as stated earlier strong foundation of an indigenous industrial base, domestic entrepreneurial class, knowledge enhancing institutions and improvements in vertical social and economic mobility during the decades 1960s to 1990s. Th e recent growth dividend is not just a miracle of marketisation but is built on decades of conscious nation building since independence and extension of the Reserve Bank\u2019s mandate during the period interalia  to building institutions and improving their delivery capabilities. Some of the major achievements have been:  7i. Annual real GDP growth averaged 5.7 per cent for the 1990s and 6.9 per cent for the period 2000-01 to 2006-07. The high real GDP growth during recent years was led by both industrial and services sector.  ii. Poverty has fallen significantly. Poverty rate is estimated to have fallen from 37 per cent in 1993-94 to 28 per cent in 2004-05, clearly establishing the link between faster growth and poverty reduction. Measures of income inequality also declined during this period.  iii. Other social indicators have shown similar improvements over the last two decades or so: life expectancy has increased from 53 in 1980 to 63 years during 1999-2003; the infant mortality rate has dropped from 110 in 1981 to 58 per thousand live births in 2005; and literacy has risen from 44 in 1981 to 65 per cent in 2001.  iv. The external position has also strengthened: since the 1991 balance of payments crisis, official reserves have risen steadily and now stand at around US $282 billion (as on January 11, 2008). Although the current account deficit has remained modest, averaging one per cent of GDP since the early 1990s, the integration of the Indian economy with the global economy has increased significantly over the same period. This can be seen in the steady rise in the current receipts-GDP ratio from around 8 per cent in 1990-91 to 27 per cent in 2006-07. Over the same period, current receipts and current payments combined together increased from 19 per cent to 54 per cent. Gross capital inflows and outflows constituted 46 per cent of GDP in 2006-07 as compared with only 12 per cent in 1990-91. v. External debt has declined to around 18 per cent of GDP.  vi. It is important to note that not only has there been a steady upward shift in India\u2019s growth path, but this has also been accompanied by enduring stability. A remarkable feature of India's growth experience has been its resilience to both global and domestic shocks. vii. The fiscal reforms through the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) is a significant measure.  Overall, the fiscal reform process spanning both the Centre and States has been wide ranging of which the important ones are: (i) unique features in the management of pub lic debt which impact stability - States have no direct exposure to external debt and almost the whole of public debt is in domestic currency and held mostly by residents; (ii) The Reserve Bank cannot subscribe to primary issues since April 1997, thereby providing safeguards to monetary policy from the consequences of expansionary fiscal policy.  8However, there are several challenges of reforming the public sector enterprise, improving agricultural productivity and efficiency, financing public infrastructure, reducing poverty, expanding access to education and environmental, etc. From a central banking perspective, in the Indian context, the principal challenge for public policy is to ensure a smooth transition to higher growth path, accompanied by low and stable inflation and well anchored inflation expectations. For the Indian financial system, the biggest challenge is how to extend itself and innovate to meet the new demands for financial inclusion and respond adequately to new opportunities and risks. Innovative channels for credit delivery for serving the new credit needs have to be developed, perhaps with greater use of information technology and intensified skills development in human capital. Notwithstanding the substantial improvement in the domestic banking system, it will need to be further strengthened to face greater external competition and introduction of financial innovations and fuller capital account co nvertibility. It will require action on several fronts like introduction of greater competition; convergence of activities and supervision of financial conglomerates; induction of new technology; improvement in credit risk appraisal; encouragement of financial innovations and improvement in internal controls. The role of the Reserve Bank in this context amounts to promoting safety and soundness while allowing the banking system to compete and innovate. There exists a well functioning fairly deep and liquid markets for bonds currency and derivatives market. However it needs further development to enhance the efficiency of the transmission mechanism, along with the development of the corporate debt market and exchange traded interest rate futures. RBI has already placed in public domain draft guidelines on currency futures and credit derivatives.  Over and above, price stabili ty and financial stability would continue to be the main challenges with expected increase in credit expansion and global integration. India\u2019s social indicators at the start of the reforms in 1991 lagged behind the levels achieved in south-east Asia around twenty years ago when these countries started growing rapidly (Dreze and Sen, 1995). While privatisation in all other sectors of the economy were initiated with the reform process, there was a growing understanding that in order to bring about improvement in social sector, a stronger Government  initiative is required. While the Central Government expenditure on social sector as percentage of GDP has shown an increasing trend in the post-reform period, albeit  with some exceptional years, the State Government expenditure on social sector has declined. On the whole, taking Central and State expenditure together, social sector expenditure has more or less remained constant.  Thus while the social indicators have shown some improvements in post-reform period, these can be associated with the indirect effect of economic growth and not to any directed effort. It is almost a consensus that the challenges in this direction are enormous. The UNDP's global Human Development Report (HDR) for 2006 ranks India at 126 out of 177 countries, being lower by two compared with 2000. Reprioritisation of expenditures towards social sectors and improvement in public service delivery are essential. Higher public spending on social services, coupled with a focus on quality, would improve the social infrastructure and provide productivity gains. For the current growth momentum to be entrenched on a durable basis, there is a need for a significant enhancement in capacity building and in the availability of public services that cannot be adeq uately provided by the private sector. Fiscal empowerment would allow higher outlays for boosting infrastructure and social sector spending, which will have a beneficial impact on domestic productivity, growth and employment.   9State Governments   There is evidence to suggest that availability of fu nds is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for tackling the problems of poverty, backwardness and low human development in India. Successful implementation of development programmes also requires appropriate policy framework, formulation of suitable plan schemes, and effective delivery machinery on the part of funding Ministries/State Governments. The State Governments in India are responsible for most public expenditures relating to the provision of social services including health and education, as also most infrastructure services except telecommunications, civil aviation, railways and major ports. They are also responsible for law and order. The ability of the States to spend on social services and infrastructure, thus, has important implications for the overall economic development.  As widely documented, the deterioration in the fiscal position of States was reflected in the decline in developmental expenditure of the States in the second half of the 1990s compared with that during 1990-95, which had a significant deleterious impact on the States\u2019 social expenditures including education and health. With active initiatives of the States towards fiscal correction and consolidation in the recent period, there has been a reversal of the trend of developmental expenditure and social expenditures as well. The State Governments in their budgets for 2007-08 proposed higher allocations to social sector expenditure in order to ensure improved quality of human resource development. In view of the priority given to infras tructure development in the Eleventh Five Year Plan, the State Governments have envisaged implementation of vari ous projects, especially power and roads. Many State Governments have proposed to implement the infrastructure projects through the framework of public-private partnership (PPP) and development of urban infrastructure under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM).    Furthermore, it is found that the economically less developed States are also the ones with low human development index (HDI) and economically better-off States are found to have relatively better performance on HDI. However, the relation between the HDI and the level of development does not show any correspondence among the middle-income Indian States. For example, among medi um-income States, Kerala had high HDI, while Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal did not show high HDI values. IV. Conclusion   The old paradigm of Indian development based on the active involvement of the State for economic development and poverty removal, was used to justify intervention in and entry of the State into every sphere of economic activity, gradually substituting the position occu pied by the private sector, co-operatives, individuals and social groups. This was accompanied by a gradual but pervasive deterioration of governance, as also distortions in the attitudes and operations of business, workers and farmers. Though this deterioration started with specific areas of government operations and specific regions of the country, it spread over almost every field of activity in which Government was involved. This led to the end of the old paradigm and the emergence of a new approach.     10        The new paradigm is based on a clear and non-ideological recognition of the strengths and the weakness of the State and the people. A democratic society has enormous potential for entrepreneurship, innovation and creative development. The people, their diverse forms of activity and association such as companies, co-operatives, societies, trusts and other NGOs must be allowed and encouraged to play their due role. The State must focus on what only it can do best and shed all activities that the people can do as well or better. Economic theory also tells us that under certain conditions market compet ition produces results that are the most ef ficient. The State will have to manage the economy so as to accelerate employment and income growth in a self sustaining manner, ensure that all citizens receive their entitlements of basic public goods and services and empower the poor so that they have equal rights (and responsibilities) with the better of citizens. Similarly given the large infrastructure requirements of the country the public sector will have to play a large role in provid ing infrastructure funding. T he Government is actively pursuing PPPs to bridge the infrastructure deficit and several initiatives have been taken to promote PPPs in infrastructure development. The appraisal mechanism of the PPP projects has been streamlined to ensure speedy clearance of the projects removal of red tape adoption of international best practices and bringing uniformity in guidelines. The awareness of concerns and issues relating to PPP however is still lacking and not evenly spread across different states.     Decentralisation of governance was ushered in the early 1990s through the 73rd and the 74th constitutional amendments raising hopes for better delivery of public services, sensitive to local needs. The argument in favour of decentralisation of planning is based on the fact that as the distance between the action point at which information is generated and the point at which decision is made increases, the information cost increases. In the Indian case, the wide regional variations in natural endowments, and levels of development, a single strategy may prove to be inappropriate justifying decentralisation of the planning pr ocess. The advantage of decentralised planning lies with the possibility of tapping local resources by ensuring grea ter participation of the people in the development process given the possibility of centralized  planning and implementation machinery being delineated from the public.    11          Any new approach must correct the incentives for productivity and efficiency. Laws, rules and procedures are such that they minimise the time   and money cost of compliance to relatively honest economic agents. Any process of sustained economic reform and investment requires a framework of long-term policy to which the Government can credibly commit itself. Reforms anywhere can be popular if they are oriented to aspects of human development (education, health, child nutrition, drinking water, women\u2019s welfare and autonomy, etc.). Reformers usually are preoccupied with problems of the foreign trade regime, fiscal deficits, and the constraints on industrial investments, and they believe that once these are handled right, trickle-down will take care of the issues that concern the masses. In the age of financial globalisation, the Indian economy cannot remain insulated from international developments. This makes it all the more important that India adopts the right strategy and takes the right steps now to boost long-term growth, and to fulfill its economi c potential. To quote Governor Reddy2: 'One of the determining factors in India, for moving forward, would be the reforms in governance, th at are critical to strengthen State capacity to perform its core functions more effectively and equitably. The business community has a vital stake in the improvement of the quality of governance by empowering the public institutions, since good governance can prevail only when public institutions function fairly and efficiently'.                   I wish the Seminar all success in its deliberations.                                                                   2 Some Perspectives on the Indian Economy , Address by Dr. Y.V.Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington D.C., USA on October 17, 2007.
