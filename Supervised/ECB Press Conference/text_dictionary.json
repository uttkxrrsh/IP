We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interestrates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended periodof time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases.Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that our net asset purchases, atthe current monthly pace of \u20ac30 billion, are intended to run until the end of September 2018, orbeyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in thepath of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The Eurosystem will continue to reinvest the principalpayments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extendedperiod of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary. Thiswill contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance.Following several quarters of higher than expected growth, incoming information since our meeting inearly March points towards some moderation, while remaining consistent with a solid and broad-basedexpansion of the euro area economy. The underlying strength of the euro area economy continues tosupport our confidence that inflation will converge towards our inflation aim of below, but close to, 2%over the medium term. At the same time, measures of underlying inflation remain subdued and haveyet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. In this context, the Governing Council willcontinue to monitor developments in the exchange rate and other financial conditions with regard totheir possible implications for the inflation outlook. Overall, an ample degree of monetary stimulusremains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up and support headlineinflation developments over the medium term. This continued monetary support is provided by the netasset purchases, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the ongoing and forthcomingreinvestments, and by our forward guidance on interest rates.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDPincreased by 0.7%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2017, following similar growth in theprevious quarter. This resulted in an average annual growth rate of 2.4% in 2017 \u2013 the highest since2007. The latest economic indicators suggest some moderation in the pace of growth since the start ofthe year. This moderation may in part reflect a pull-back from the high pace of growth observed at theend of last year, while temporary factors may also be at work. Overall, however, growth is expected toremain solid and broad-based. Our monetary policy measures, which have facilitated the deleveragingprocess, should continue to underpin domestic demand. Private consumption is supported by ongoingemployment gains, which, in turn, partly reflect past labour market reforms, and by growing householdwealth. Business investment continues to strengthen on the back of very favourable financingJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:09 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180426.en.html 2/11conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. Housing investment continues to improve. Inaddition, the broad-based global expansion is providing impetus to euro area exports.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced. However, risks related toglobal factors, including the threat of increased protectionism, have become more prominent.Euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 1.3% in March 2018, from 1.1% in February. Thisreflected mainly higher food price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates ofheadline inflation are likely to hover around 1.5% for the remainder of the year. Measures of underlyinginflation remain subdued overall. Looking ahead, they are expected to rise gradually over the mediumterm, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, thecorresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with anannual growth rate of 4.2% in February 2018, slightly below the narrow range observed since mid-2015. M3 growth continues to reflect the impact of the ECB\u2019s monetary policy measures and the lowopportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits. Accordingly, the narrow monetary aggregate M1remained the main contributor to broad money growth, continuing to expand at a solid annual rate.The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 isproceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 3.1% in February2018, after 3.4% in January and 3.1% in December 2017, while the annual growth rate of loans tohouseholds remained unchanged at 2.9%. The euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of2018 indicates that loan growth continues to be supported by increasing demand across all loancategories and a further easing in overall bank lending conditions for loans to enterprises and loans forhouse purchase.The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues tosignificantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing \u2012 notably forsmall and medium-sized enterprises \u2012 and credit flows across the euro area.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed the need for an ample degree of monetary accommodation to secure asustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the mediumterm.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contributedecisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementationof structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increaseresilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential.Against the background of overall limited implementation of the 2017 country-specificrecommendations, greater reform effort is necessary in euro area countries. Regarding fiscal policies,the ongoing broad-based expansion calls for rebuilding fiscal buffers. This is particularly important incountries where government debt remains high. All countries would benefit from intensifying effortstowards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. A full, transparent andconsistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the macroeconomic imbalanceprocedure over time and across countries remains essential to increase the resilience of the euro area11/23/23, 4:09 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180426.en.html 3/11economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. TheGoverning Council urges specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capitalmarkets union.We are now at your disposal for questions.* * *At your last press conference you said that strong incoming data on growth was helping toreduce the variance and the path of inflation. I'm wondering, now that we've seen some weaker-than-expected data, is there a risk that the variance in inflation could increase and potentiallyslow down the process of convergence?My second question is: over the last four weeks there has been quite a noticeable drop in thenet corporate bond purchases. I'm wondering whether you could explain the reasons for that.Draghi: Let me answer first the second question. I think it's always wrong to fix attention to one specificweek or one specific month. You know this - there is a certain amount of flexibility around purchases.So, what's happened here is that we had a higher seasonal amount of purchases at some point andtherefore we kind of averaged down with lower purchases. This coincided also with a downsize of theprogramme that took place after December. There is no specific strategy behind the lower amount ofpurchases of the private corporate bonds.Now, the first question perhaps suggests that I report on the exchanges we had today because thiswould explain the answer to your question. First of all, the interesting thing is that we didn't discussmonetary policy per se. All Governing Council members reported on the situation of their owncountries. It's quite clear that since our last meeting, broadly all countries experienced, to differentextents of course, some moderation in growth or some loss of momentum. When we look at theindicators that showed significant, sharp declines, we see that, first of all, the fact that all countriesreported means that this loss of momentum is pretty broad across countries. It's also broad acrosssectors because when we look at the indicators, it's both hard and soft survey-based indicators. Sharpdeclines were experienced by PMI, almost all sectors, in retail, sales, manufacturing, services, inconstruction. Then we had declines in industrial production, in capital goods production. The PMI inexports orders also declined. Also we had declines in national business and confidence indicators.And these declines were sharp and in some cases, the extent of these declines was unexpected. Theissue is how the Governing Council has read these new developments and I think this was yourquestion, really. First of all, we have to look at - the present figures now \u2013 first of all, the declinestabilised and the levels at which they are today are still above historical averages. Second, thesedeclines happened, as I've just said in the Introductory Statement, after a period of very strong growthfor the euro area. We had four quarters, if I'm not mistaken, at 0.7%[]. Some sort of normalisation wasexpected.Then we discussed the possible causes of this or how to read through \u2013 to read this normalisation.Clearly there is some unexpected component, as I was saying, which is mostly due to temporaryfactors like the \u2013 especially in one country it's cold weather, it's the strikes, it's the timing of Easter.There are several temporary factors which may have produced this unexpected size. Then thediscussion was how much of this is supply, is the effect of supply constraints that are limited to labour111/23/23, 4:09 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180426.en.html 4/11shortages in some sectors like construction? But there are also other phenomena like for example thedrop in backlogs, in manufacturing and capital goods sectors that would \u2013 could suggest a softening indemand and therefore warrant monitoring by the Governing Council.So if I had to just give you an idea what the bottom line of this discussion is in my view, it's basicallycaution in reading these developments, caution tempered by an unchanged confidence in theconvergence of inflation to our inflation aim. The overall growth remains, as I've just said, solid andbroad based. The risks are broadly balanced but, as I said, with more prominence to global risks and Imentioned protectionism. Now, having said that, measures of underlying inflation since our lastmeeting moved sideways. There hasn't been any convincing upward trend or signs that this upwardtrend is about to come. There are certain encouraging signs on nominal wage growth where we startseeing some movements which may support price pressures in the coming months. This is about it - Ithink I've answered your question.The euro is considerably stronger than it was a year ago. In previous speeches you'vementioned that the volatility of the exchange rate is something that you're watching quiteclosely. It now seems to have stabilised around 1.22. Is this still something that concerns you?My second question is, I know you said that you didn't discuss the policy outlook. But a lot ofanalysts are looking at the incoming data \u2013 and pushing back their forecast for when the ECBmight start to raise interest rates. Do you think that is sensible? What conditions would you belooking for, do you think, before you started raising interest rates?Draghi: I'll answer your second question first. I said caution tempered by an unchanged confidencethat inflation will converge towards our aim over the medium term. But such convergence remainsconditional on an ample degree of monetary accommodation. In the end, steady hand were wordsused in the discussion in the Governing Council. Our policy has, as you've just reminded us, served uswell and will continue to do so. Therefore the other words we used were patience, prudence first of allin assessing, patience and persistence. Finally, it goes without saying that the Governing Councilshares its steadfast commitment to price stability, defined as a rate of inflation which is close but below2% in the medium term.Now, on your first question you're right; the exchange rate stabilised and recent volatility is less. So itwas not discussed.My first question is, you mentioned protectionism as a risk factor. It seems quite possible thatthe US extends its tariffs on aluminium and so on, also on the EU. How could an escalation ofthe trade dispute affect the ECB's monetary policy?My second question is on the G30. The ECB has recently decided that you as the ECBPresident can remain a member of the G30 group. One question behind that is not only if thismembership poses an actual conflict of interest, but also a perceived conflict of interest. Whydo you think the ECB itself is better suited to assess if there is a perceived conflict of interestthan an independent watchdog like the Ombudsman?The answer to your second question is in the very carefully prepared opinion of the ECB that wassubmitted about two weeks ago.", "1": "11/23/23, 3:51 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190410~c27197866f.en.html 1/12INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEMario Draghi, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-Presidentof the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 10 April 2019Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interestrates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through theend of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergenceof inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.We intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchasedunder the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when we startraising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourableliquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure thatinflation continues to move towards the Governing Council\u2019s inflation aim in a sustained manner.Details on the precise terms of the new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs)will be communicated at one of our forthcoming meetings. In particular, the pricing of the new TLTRO-III operations will take into account a thorough assessment of the bank-based transmission channel ofmonetary policy, as well as further developments in the economic outlook. In the context of our regularassessment, we will also consider whether the preservation of the favourable implications of negativeinterest rates for the economy requires the mitigation of their possible side effects, if any, on bankintermediation.The information that has become available since the last Governing Council meeting in early Marchconfirms slower growth momentum extending into the current year. While there are signs that some ofthe idiosyncratic domestic factors dampening growth are fading, global headwinds continue to weighon euro area growth developments. The persistence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, thethreat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, is leaving marks on economicsentiment. At the same time, further employment gains and rising wages continue to underpin theresilience of the domestic economy and gradually rising inflation pressures. However, an ampledegree of monetary accommodation remains necessary to safeguard favourable financing conditionsand support the economic expansion, and thus to ensure that inflation remains on a sustained pathtowards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Significant monetary policystimulus is being provided by our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by thereinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series of TLTROs.Jump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 3:51 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190410~c27197866f.en.html 2/12Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro areareal GDP rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2018, following an increase of 0.1%in the third quarter. Incoming data continue to be weak, especially for the manufacturing sector, mainlyon account of the slowdown in external demand, which has been compounded by some country andsector-specific factors. As the impact of these factors is turning out to be somewhat longer-lasting, theslower growth momentum is expected to extend into the current year. Looking ahead, the effect ofthese adverse factors is expected to unwind. The euro area expansion will continue to be supported byfavourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, and the ongoing \u2013 albeitsomewhat slower \u2013 expansion in global activity.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, on account of thepersistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism andvulnerabilities in emerging markets.According to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.4% in March 2019, after1.5% in February, reflecting mainly a decline in food, services and non-energy industrial goods priceinflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline over thecoming months. Measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, but labour cost pressureshave strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labourmarkets. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term, supportedby our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth increased to 4.3% in February 2019,from 3.8% in January. Looking through some volatility in monthly flows, M3 growth continues to bebacked by bank credit creation, notwithstanding a recent moderation in credit dynamics. The narrowmonetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth.The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rebounded to 3.7% in February 2019,from 3.4% in January, reflecting mainly a base effect. Looking through short-term volatility, the annualgrowth rate of loans to non-financial corporations has moderated in recent months, reflecting thetypical lagged reaction to the slowdown in economic growth. At the same time, the annual growth rateof loans to households remained broadly unchanged at 3.3% in February. The euro area bank lendingsurvey for the first quarter of 2019 suggests that overall bank lending conditions remained favourable.Our monetary policy measures, including the new series of TLTROs that we announced in March, willhelp to safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing,in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary forthe continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over themedium term.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contributemore decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. Theimplementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up toincrease resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth11/23/23, 3:51 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190410~c27197866f.en.html 3/12potential. Regarding fiscal policies, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the operationof automatic stabilisers are providing support to economic activity. At the same time, countries wheregovernment debt is high need to continue rebuilding fiscal buffers. All countries should reinforce theirefforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. Likewise, the transparent andconsistent implementation of the European Union\u2019s fiscal and economic governance framework overtime and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy.Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Councilwelcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the bankingunion and the capital markets union.We are now at your disposal for questions.* * *One question first of all, you mentioned that in the context of your regular assessment you willconsider whether the preservation of favourable implications requires mitigation of possibleside-effects on bank intermediation from, I understand, negative rates. You made comments toa similar effect at the Watchers' conference recently, and it sparked a lot of speculation thatyou might be on the cusp of introducing a tiering system, so I would like to know from youwhether that's something that's on the menu; whether that's something that you areconsidering. That's my first question.The second is: You also mentioned that we'll get the pricing of TLTROs in the forthcomingmeetings. We saw the bank lending survey yesterday. In your assessment in terms of loangrowth and loan demand, does it give any indication of the conditions that could underpin theincentive scheme for the next TLTROs?Draghi: Well, I would say to the second question, I would answer it's too early. It's just too early. If youread the statement I just gave, there is the - we, in a sense, - the Governing Council gives the criteriaupon which this assessment for both the TLTRO III and the mitigation of possible side-effects wouldtake place, the conditions under which the analysis would be carried out. It's two conditions. We'll takeinto account a thorough assessment of the bank-based transmission channel for our monetary policy,as well as further developments in the economic outlook. So we are looking at that, both things, andright now it's too early to decide about both. I would say the Governing Council was, I would say - wedidn't vote, so it's not unanimous or anything - but it just had a consensus on the need for furtheranalysis on both issues.That, in a sense, includes the first question, because this language echoes what I did say in the ECBWatchers' speech, and that's it; we've got to look at that. The way we look is well specified here. Welook at the functioning of the financial intermediation channel. As I said, the assessment of the bank-based transmission channel of monetary policy, as well as further developments in the economicoutlook. So we have to see how the economic outlook will turn out between now and the nextmonetary policy meeting. Where, by the way, we also will be having the new projections.There seems to have been over recent months quite a marked deterioration in the five-year-on-five-year inflation swap rate that suggests markets are becoming more concerned about yourability to hit the inflation target. In the past the fall in this measure was a trigger for the11/23/23, 3:51 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190410~c27197866f.en.html 4/12introduction of QE at the beginning, and the expansion of the QE programmes, so howconcerned are you about this, this time around, and how would you intend to react if this fallcontinues?The second topic, we've had some remarks from the US president yesterday saying that he'sgoing to impose tariffs on some European goods. To what extent are you concerned by theseremarks, and does it represent a serious risk to the euro zone economy if this comes about andif there's an intensification of the trade frictions between Europe and the US?Draghi: Now, your first question points out the continued deterioration of inflation expectations over thelast several months, and we had quite a substantial analysis of why this is so. It's quite clear that thesliding of the five-year-to-five-year inflation expectations corresponds to a deterioration of theeconomic outlook. It's also quite clear that as the economic outlook, especially the economic activityslows down, also markets expect less pressure in the labour market, but we haven't seen that yet. Sowe have underlying strength in the economy, and so we analyse why this is so. The answer is thatinflation expectations have deteriorated predominantly because of the risk premium, or the negativerisk premium, which is a big difference to 2016. You may remember that in the early part of 2016 wehad a similar deterioration of inflation expectations. That was different. At that time it was not so muchbecause of the risk premium, but it was a real danger of de-anchoring.So this is good news in the sense that it says that expectations are responding to the economicoutlook, but not de-anchoring. However, this increase in the negative risk premium might reflect eitherthe market perception, that we don't have instruments, and I think we've shown that we have plenty ofinstruments. If anything, the market reaction to my ECB Watchers' speech last time shows that wehave plenty of instruments. Of course, that market reaction demonstrated that markets have fullyunderstood our reaction function. Now, the second possibility is that we may well - I mean, the marketsmay think - the Governing Council would tolerate low inflation, too low inflation, without being de-anchored, but low. Now, let me just dispel any such impression. Of course, we remain fully committedto return inflation to 2% without undue delay. Also, let me also point out another aspect of this. Ourinflation aim doesn't imply a ceiling at 2%; inflation can deviate from our objective in both directions, solong as the path of inflation converges to our medium-term objective.Now, the second question is about this threat of tariffs from President Trump toward the Europeans. Ofcourse, we listed the threat of protection as one of the potential factors dampening growth in the euroarea - and elsewhere in the world, as a matter of fact - so this is not different from this viewpoint. Well,we have to see, first of all, what happens, because as you've seen in the past between words anddeeds there is often a big gulf. But certainly, even the fact that these threats are being vented withsome frequency, they certainly undermine general confidence, and there is no question about the factthat that's one of the reasons for the general weakness in the euro zone, I believe. Elsewhere in theworld the confidence weakening has come from various threats, various vulnerabilities - it's acombination of effects - but certainly also from these threats of further protectionist measures.So am I correct to assume and understand that you did discuss the precise terms of theTLTROs at today's meeting? The reason I ask is because the June meeting would come justdays after you have a new chief economist on board, meaning much of the preparatory workwould have to have been done by a predecessor. So do you see the Governing Council putting", "2": "11/23/23, 4:13 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200430~ab3058e07f.en.html 1/12INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 30 April 2020Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council, whichwas also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.The euro area is facing an economic contraction of a magnitude and speed that are unprecedented inpeacetime. Measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) have largely haltedeconomic activity in all the countries of the euro area and across the globe. Survey indicators forconsumer and business sentiment have plunged, suggesting a sharp contraction in economic growthand a profound deterioration in labour market conditions. Given the high uncertainty surrounding theultimate extent of the economic fallout, growth scenarios produced by ECB staff suggest that euro areaGDP could fall by between 5% and 12% this year, depending crucially on the duration of thecontainment measures and the success of policies to mitigate the economic consequences forbusinesses and workers. As the containment measures are gradually lifted, these scenarios foresee arecovery in economic activity, although its speed and scale remain highly uncertain. Inflation hasdeclined as a result of the sharp fall in oil prices and slightly lower HICP inflation excluding energy andfood.The decisive and targeted policy measures that we have taken since early March have providedcrucial support to the euro area economy and especially to the sectors most exposed to the crisis. Inparticular, our measures are supporting liquidity conditions and helping to sustain the flow of credit tohouseholds and firms, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and to maintainfavourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions.We welcome the measures taken by euro area governments and the European institutions to ensuresufficient healthcare resources and to provide support to affected companies, workers andhouseholds. At the same time, continued and ambitious efforts are needed, notably through joint andcoordinated policy action, to guard against downside risks and to underpin the recovery.In line with our mandate, the Governing Council is determined to continue to support households andfirms in the face of the current economic disruption and heightened uncertainty, in order to safeguardmedium-term price stability.Accordingly, the Governing Council decided today to further ease the conditions on our targetedlonger-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). Specifically, we decided to reduce the interest rate onTLTRO III operations during the period from June 2020 to June 2021 to 50 basis points below theaverage interest rate on the Eurosystem\u2019s main refinancing operations prevailing over the sameperiod. Moreover, for counterparties whose eligible net lending reaches the lending performanceJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:13 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200430~ab3058e07f.en.html 2/12threshold, the interest rate over the period from June 2020 to June 2021 will now be 50 basis pointsbelow the average deposit facility rate prevailing over the same period.We also decided on a new series of non-targeted pandemic emergency longer-term refinancingoperations (PELTROs) to support liquidity conditions in the euro area financial system and contributeto preserving the smooth functioning of money markets by providing an effective liquidity backstop.The PELTROs consist of seven additional refinancing operations commencing in May 2020 andmaturing in a staggered sequence between July and September 2021 in line with the duration of ourcollateral easing measures. They will be carried out as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment,with an interest rate that is 25 basis points below the average rate on the main refinancing operationsprevailing over the life of each PELTRO.Further details on the amendments made to the terms of TLTRO III and on our new PELTROs will bepublished in dedicated press releases this afternoon at 15:30 CET.Since the end of March we have been conducting purchases under our new pandemic emergencypurchase programme (PEPP), which has an overall envelope of \u20ac750 billion, to ease the overallmonetary policy stance and to counter the severe risks to the monetary policy transmissionmechanism and the outlook for the euro area posed by the coronavirus pandemic. These purchaseswill continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and amongjurisdictions. We will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until the Governing Council judgesthat the coronavirus crisis phase is over, but in any case until the end of this year.Moreover, net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly paceof \u20ac20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional \u20ac120 billion temporary envelope untilthe end of the year. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for aslong as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly beforewe start raising the key ECB interest rates.We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the keyECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditionsand an ample degree of monetary accommodation.In addition, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain attheir present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a levelsufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has beenconsistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.Together with the substantial monetary policy stimulus already in place, these measures will supportliquidity and funding conditions and help to preserve the smooth provision of credit to the realeconomy. At the same time, in the current rapidly evolving economic environment, the GoverningCouncil remains fully committed to doing everything necessary within its mandate to support allcitizens of the euro area through this extremely challenging time. This applies first and foremost to ourrole in ensuring that our monetary policy is transmitted to all parts of the economy and to alljurisdictions in the pursuit of our price stability mandate. We are, therefore, fully prepared to increasethe size of the PEPP and adjust its composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed.11/23/23, 4:13 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200430~ab3058e07f.en.html 3/12In any case, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, toensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment tosymmetry.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latesteconomic indicators and survey results covering the period since the coronavirus spread to the euroarea have shown an unprecedented decline, pointing to a significant contraction in euro areaeconomic activity and to rapidly deteriorating labour markets. The coronavirus pandemic and theassociated containment measures have severely affected the manufacturing and services sectors,taking a toll on the productive capacity of the euro area economy and on domestic demand. In the firstquarter of 2020, which was only partially affected by the spread of the coronavirus, euro area real GDPdecreased by 3.8%, quarter on quarter, reflecting the impact of the lockdown measures in the finalweeks of the quarter. The sharp downturn in economic activity in April suggests that the impact is likelyto be even more severe in the second quarter. Looking beyond the immediate disruption stemmingfrom the coronavirus pandemic, euro area growth is expected to resume as the containment measuresare gradually lifted, supported by favourable financing conditions, the euro area fiscal stance and aresumption in global activity.Given the highly uncertain duration of the pandemic, the likely extent and duration of the imminentrecession and the subsequent recovery are difficult to predict. However, without pre-empting theforthcoming Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, which will be published in June, growthscenarios produced by ECB staff suggest that euro area GDP could fall by between 5% and 12% thisyear, followed by a recovery and normalisation of growth in subsequent years. The extent of thecontraction and the recovery will depend crucially on the duration and the success of the containmentmeasures, how far supply capacity and domestic demand are permanently affected, and the successof policies in mitigating the adverse impact on incomes and employment.According to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation decreased from 0.7% in Marchto 0.4% in April, largely driven by lower energy price inflation, but also slightly lower HICP inflationexcluding energy and food. On the basis of the sharp decline in current and futures prices for oil,headline inflation is likely to decline considerably further over the coming months. The sharp downturnin economic activity is expected to lead to negative effects on underlying inflation over the comingmonths. However, the medium-term implications of the coronavirus pandemic for inflation aresurrounded by high uncertainty, given that downward pressures linked to weaker demand may bepartially offset by upward pressures related to supply disruptions. Market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have remained at depressed levels. Even though survey-based indicatorsof inflation expectations have declined over the short and medium term, longer-term expectations havebeen less affected.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth increased to 7.5% in March 2020, from5.5% in February. Money growth reflects bank credit creation for the private sector, which is driven to alarge extent by drawing on credit lines, and low opportunity costs of holding M3 relative to otherfinancial instruments, while heightened economic uncertainty appears to have triggered a shift towardsmonetary holdings, likely for precautionary reasons. In this environment, the narrow monetary11/23/23, 4:13 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200430~ab3058e07f.en.html 4/12aggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the main contributor tobroad money growth.Developments in loans to the private sector have also been shaped by the impact of the coronavirus.The annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.4% in March 2020, after 3.7% in February,while the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 5.4% in March, after 3.0%in February. These developments are also clearly visible in the results of the euro area bank lendingsurvey for the first quarter of 2020, which indicate a surge in firms\u2019 demand for loans and for drawingon credit lines to meet liquidity needs for working capital, while financing needs for fixed investmentdeclined. Demand for loans to households for house purchase increased less than in the previousquarter. Credit standards for loans to firms tightened slightly, while credit standards for loans tohouseholds tightened more strongly. In both cases, this was related to the deterioration in theeconomic outlook and a decline in the creditworthiness of firms and households. At the same time,banks expect an easing of credit standards for loans to firms in the second quarter of 2020.Our policy measures, in particular the more favourable terms for TLTRO III operations and thecollateral easing measures, should encourage banks to extend loans to all private sector entities.Together with the credit support measures adopted by national governments and Europeaninstitutions, they support ongoing access to financing, including for those most affected by theramifications of the coronavirus pandemic.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary for therobust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance is critical, in view of the sharpcontraction in the euro area economy. Measures taken should as much as possible be targeted andtemporary in nature in response to the pandemic emergency. We welcome the endorsement by theEuropean Council of the Eurogroup agreement on the three safety nets for workers, businesses andsovereigns, amounting to a package worth \u20ac540 billion. At the same time, the Governing Council urgesfurther strong and timely efforts to prepare and support the recovery. In this regard, we welcome theEuropean Council agreement to work towards establishing a recovery fund dedicated to dealing withthis unprecedented crisis.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *We will very shortly take your questions but before that, on behalf of the entire Eurosystem and allmembers of the ECB, I would like to acknowledge once more that this is a global health crisis and thatthe highest priority has to go to trying to save lives and prevent the spread of the disease.

We will now report on the outcome of the meeting of the Governing Council.While the recovery in global demand and the sizeable fiscal stimulus are supporting global and euroarea activity, the near-term economic outlook remains clouded by uncertainty about the resurgence ofthe pandemic and the roll-out of vaccination campaigns. Persistently high rates of coronavirus(COVID-19) infection and the associated extension and tightening of containment measures continueto constrain economic activity in the short term. Looking ahead, progress with vaccination campaignsand the envisaged gradual relaxation of containment measures underpin the expectation of a firmrebound in economic activity in the course of 2021. Inflation has picked up over recent months onaccount of some idiosyncratic and temporary factors and an increase in energy price inflation. At thesame time, underlying price pressures remain subdued in the context of significant economic slackand still weak demand.Preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period remains essential to reduceuncertainty and bolster confidence, thereby underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability. Euro area financing conditions have remained broadly stable recently after theincrease in market interest rates earlier in the year, but risks to wider financing conditions remain.Against this background, the Governing Council decided to reconfirm its very accommodativemonetary policy stance.We will keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present orlower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to,but below, 2 per cent within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistentlyreflected in underlying inflation dynamics.We will continue to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme(PEPP) with a total envelope of \u20ac1,850 billion until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case,until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. Since the incominginformation confirmed the joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook carried outat the March monetary policy meeting, the Governing Council expects purchases under the PEPP overthe current quarter to continue to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the firstmonths of the year.We will purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening offinancing conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on theJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:17 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210422~b0ad2d3414.en.html 2/12projected path of inflation. In addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes andamong jurisdictions will continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy. If favourablefinancing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelopeover the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full. Equally, theenvelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter thenegative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.We will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under thePEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will bemanaged to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.Net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of \u20ac20billion. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long asnecessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before westart raising the key ECB interest rates.We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the keyECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditionsand an ample degree of monetary accommodation.Finally, we will continue to provide ample liquidity through our refinancing operations. In particular, thelatest operation in the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) hasregistered a high take-up of funds. The funding obtained through TLTRO III plays a crucial role insupporting bank lending to firms and households.These measures help to preserve favourable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy andthereby underpin economic activity and safeguard medium-term price stability. We will also continue tomonitor developments in the exchange rate with regard to their possible implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensure thatinflation moves towards our aim in a sustained manner, in line with our commitment to symmetry.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro areareal GDP declined by 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020 to stand 4.9 per cent below its pre-pandemic level one year earlier. Incoming economic data, surveys and high-frequency indicatorssuggest that economic activity may have contracted again in the first quarter of this year, but point to aresumption of growth in the second quarter.Business surveys indicate that the manufacturing sector continues to recover, supported by solidglobal demand. At the same time, restrictions on mobility and social interaction still limit activity in theservices sector, although there are signs of a bottoming-out. Fiscal policy measures continue tosupport households and firms, but consumers remain cautious in view of the pandemic and its impacton employment and earnings. Despite weaker corporate balance sheets and elevated uncertaintyabout the economic outlook, business investment has shown resilience.Looking ahead, the progress with vaccination campaigns, which should allow for a gradual relaxationof containment measures, should pave the way for a firm rebound in economic activity in the course of2021. Over the medium term the recovery of the euro area economy is expected to be driven by a11/23/23, 4:17 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210422~b0ad2d3414.en.html 3/12recovery in domestic and global demand, supported by favourable financing conditions and fiscalstimulus.Overall, while the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook over the near term continue to be onthe downside, medium-term risks remain more balanced. On the one hand, better prospects for globaldemand \u2013 bolstered by the sizeable fiscal stimulus \u2013 and the progress with vaccination campaigns areencouraging. On the other hand, the ongoing pandemic, including the spread of virus mutations, andits implications for economic and financial conditions continue to be sources of downside risk.Euro area annual inflation increased to 1.3% in March 2021, from 0.9% in February, on account of astrong increase in energy price inflation that reflected both a sizeable upward base effect and a month-on-month increase. This increase more than offset decreases in food price inflation and in HICPinflation excluding energy and food. Headline inflation is likely to increase further in the comingmonths, but some volatility is expected throughout the year reflecting the changing dynamics ofidiosyncratic and temporary factors. These factors can be expected to fade out of annual inflation ratesearly next year. Underlying price pressures are expected to increase somewhat this year, owing toshort-term supply constraints and the recovery in domestic demand, although they remain subduedoverall, in part reflecting low wage pressures, in the context of economic slack, and the appreciation ofthe euro exchange rate. Once the impact of the pandemic fades, the unwinding of the high level ofslack, supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, will contribute to a gradual increasein inflation over the medium term. Survey-based measures and market-based indicators of longer-terminflation expectations remain at subdued levels, although market-based indicators have continued theirgradual increase.Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of broad money (M3) stood at 12.3 per centin February 2021, after 12.5 per cent in January. Strong money growth continued to be supported bythe ongoing asset purchases by the Eurosystem, as the largest source of money creation. The narrowmonetary aggregate M1 has remained the main contributor to broad money growth, consistent with astill heightened preference for liquidity in the money-holding sector and a low opportunity cost ofholding the most liquid forms of money.Overall, lending to the private sector remained broadly unchanged. The monthly lending flow to non-financial corporations showed a modest pick-up in February compared with the previous month. Thiswas also reflected in a slightly higher annual growth rate of 7.1 per cent, after 6.9 per cent in January.Monthly lending flows to households continued to be solid with the annual growth rate of loans tohouseholds remaining unchanged at 3.0 per cent in February. The latest euro area bank lendingsurvey for the first quarter of 2021 reports a moderate tightening of credit standards for loans to firms,following more significant tightening in the previous two quarters. Heightened risk perceptions amongbanks were again the main contributor to the tightening, although their impact was less pronouncedthan in previous survey rounds. Surveyed banks also reported a renewed fall in demand for loans tofirms, mainly driven by a continued decline in demand for financing for fixed investment. With regard tolending to households, the survey indicated lower demand for loans for house purchase, while thecredit standards for these loans eased slightly, supported by competition among lenders.Overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments and otherEuropean institutions, remain essential to support bank lending conditions and access to financing, in11/23/23, 4:17 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210422~b0ad2d3414.en.html 4/12particular for those most affected by the pandemic.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary tosupport economic activity and the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to,2 per cent over the medium term.Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains crucial, as prematurewithdrawal of fiscal support would risk delaying the recovery and amplifying the longer-term scarringeffects. National fiscal policies should thus continue to provide critical and timely support to the firmsand households most exposed to the ongoing pandemic and the associated containment measures. Atthe same time, fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should, as much aspossible, remain temporary and targeted in nature to address vulnerabilities effectively and to supporta swift recovery of the euro area economy. The three safety nets endorsed by the European Councilfor workers, businesses and governments provide important funding support.The Governing Council reiterates the key role of the Next Generation EU package and the urgency ofit becoming operational without delay. It calls on Member States to ensure a timely ratification of theOwn Resources Decision, to finalise their recovery and resilience plans promptly and to deploy thefunds for productive public spending, accompanied by productivity-enhancing structural policies. Thiswould allow the Next Generation EU programme to contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniformrecovery and would increase economic resilience and the growth potential of Member States\u2019economies, thereby supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area. Such structuralpolicies are particularly important in improving economic structures and institutions and in acceleratingthe green and digital transitions.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *Two questions, if I may. Firstly I'd be interested to hear whether you think the outlook isimproving sufficiently as your colleagues, Mr Knot and Mr Holzmann, have suggested toconsider slowing the pace of PEPP purchases from the third quarter of this year, and whetherthis was something that was discussed at today's meeting.Secondly, I'd be interested to know whether the move higher in the euro in the last couple ofweeks to levels above 1.20 was also raised in the meeting in the context of wanting to prevent apremature tightening of financial conditions.Lagarde: Well, thank you very much for your question, really it gives me a chance to go back to thekey part of our deliberations, which has to do with really taking a good look at the economic situationboth from a growth perspective, from an inflation perspective, from the financing terms that areavailable in the context of forming our joint assessment. In terms of outlook, it's very much a \u201con theone hand, on the other hand\u201d situation because there are clearly signs of improvement that are comingfrom essentially an improvement in the rollout of the vaccination plans in most euro area countries.That's on the one hand.

It is also affecting the economy,in Europe and beyond. The conflict and the associated uncertainty are weighing heavily on theconfidence of businesses and consumers. Trade disruptions are leading to new shortages of materialsand inputs. Surging energy and commodity prices are reducing demand and holding back production.How the economy develops will crucially depend on how the conflict evolves, on the impact of currentsanctions and on possible further measures. At the same time, economic activity is still beingsupported by the reopening of the economy after the crisis phase of the pandemic. Inflation hasincreased significantly and will remain high over the coming months, mainly because of the sharp risein energy costs. Inflation pressures have intensified across many sectors.At today\u2019s meeting we judged that the incoming data since our last meeting reinforce our expectationthat net asset purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) should be concluded in the thirdquarter. Looking ahead, our monetary policy will depend on the incoming data and our evolvingassessment of the outlook. In the current conditions of high uncertainty, we will maintain optionality,gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy. The Governing Council will take whateveraction is needed to fulfil the ECB\u2019s mandate to pursue price stability and to contribute to safeguardingfinancial stability.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing, and will thenexplain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityThe euro area economy grew by 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2021. It is estimated that growthremained weak during the first quarter of 2022, largely owing to pandemic-related restrictions.Several factors point to slow growth also in the period ahead. The war is already weighing on theconfidence of businesses and consumers, including through the uncertainty it brings. With energy andcommodity prices rising sharply, households are facing a higher cost of living and firms are confrontedwith higher production costs. The war has created new bottlenecks, while a new set of pandemicmeasures in Asia is contributing to supply chain difficulties. Some sectors face growing difficulties insourcing their inputs, which is disrupting production. However, there are also offsetting factorsunderpinning the ongoing recovery, such as compensatory fiscal measures and the possibility forhouseholds to draw on savings they accumulated during the pandemic. Moreover, the reopening ofJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:20 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220414~fa5c8fe142.en.html 2/11those sectors most affected by the pandemic and a strong labour market with more people in jobs willcontinue to support incomes and spending.Fiscal and monetary policy support remains critical, especially in this difficult geopolitical situation. Inaddition, the successful implementation of the investment and reform plans under the Next GenerationEU programme will accelerate the energy and green transitions. This should help enhance long-termgrowth and resilience in the euro area.InflationInflation increased to 7.5 per cent in March, from 5.9 per cent in February. Energy prices were drivenhigher after the outbreak of the war and now stand 45 per cent above their level one year ago. Theycontinue to be the main reason for the high rate of inflation. Market-based indicators suggest thatenergy prices will stay high in the near term but will then moderate to some extent. Food prices havealso increased sharply. This is due to elevated transportation and production costs, notably the higherprice of fertilisers, which are in part related to the war in Ukraine.Price rises have become more widespread. Energy costs are pushing up prices across many sectors.Supply bottlenecks and the normalisation of demand as the economy reopens also continue to putupward pressure on prices. Measures of underlying inflation have risen to levels above two per cent inrecent months. It is uncertain how persistent the rise in these indicators will be, given the role oftemporary pandemic-related factors and the indirect effects of higher energy prices.The labour market continues to improve, with unemployment having fallen to a historical low of 6.8 percent in February. Job postings across many sectors still signal robust demand for labour, yet wagegrowth remains muted overall. Over time the return of the economy to full capacity should supportfaster growth in wages. While various measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived fromfinancial markets and from expert surveys largely stand at around two per cent, initial signs of above-target revisions in those measures warrant close monitoring.Risk assessmentThe downside risks to the growth outlook have increased substantially as a result of the war inUkraine. While risks relating to the pandemic have declined, the war may have an even stronger effecton economic sentiment and could further worsen supply-side constraints. Persistently high energycosts, together with a loss of confidence, could drag down demand and restrain consumption andinvestment more than expected.The upside risks surrounding the inflation outlook have also intensified, especially in the near term.The risks to the medium-term inflation outlook include above-target moves in inflation expectations,higher than anticipated wage rises and a durable worsening of supply-side conditions. However, ifdemand were to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressure on prices.Financial and monetary conditionsFinancial markets have been highly volatile since the war began and financial sanctions wereimposed. Market interest rates have increased in response to the changing outlook for monetary11/23/23, 4:20 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220414~fa5c8fe142.en.html 3/11policy, the macroeconomic environment and inflation dynamics. Bank funding costs have continued toincrease. At the same time, so far there have been no severe strains in money markets, nor liquidityshortages in the euro area banking system.Although remaining at low levels, bank lending rates for firms and households have started to reflectthe increase in market interest rates. Lending to households is holding up, especially for housepurchases. Lending flows to firms have stabilised.Our most recent bank lending survey reports that credit standards for loans to firms and for housingloans tightened overall in the first quarter of the year, as lenders are becoming more concerned aboutthe risks facing their customers in an uncertain environment. Credit standards are expected to tightenfurther in the coming months, as banks factor in the adverse economic impact of Russia\u2019s aggressiontowards Ukraine and higher energy prices.ConclusionSumming up, the war in Ukraine is severely affecting the euro area economy and has significantlyincreased uncertainty. The impact of the war on the economy will depend on how the conflict evolves,on the effect of current sanctions and on possible further measures. Inflation has increasedsignificantly and will remain high over the coming months, mainly because of the sharp rise in energycosts. We are very attentive to the current uncertainties and are closely monitoring the incoming datain relation to their implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. The calibration of our policies willremain data-dependent and reflect our evolving assessment of the outlook. We stand ready to adjustall of our instruments within our mandate, incorporating flexibility if warranted, to ensure that inflationstabilises at our two per cent target over the medium term.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *I have two questions. The first one: could you give us a bit of a flavour for the discussion? Didsome of your colleagues call for a more definite end date for the APP, and what was theclincher argument for keeping your formulation despite sharply higher inflation?The second question is about interest rates and markets now pricing two rate hikes this year,and maybe as much as eight hikes by the end of 2023. Are you comfortable with theseexpectations? Are these expectations consistent with your definition of gradual?On your first question I would call your attention to a particular sentence in the monetary policystatement (MPS), which reflects the evolution of the Governing Council assessment of the currentsituation five weeks after the last monetary policy Governing Council meeting that we had, which is avery short interval as opposed to other periods. It is the sentence that begins the second paragraph ofthe MPS, where we say: \u201cAt today's meeting we judged that the incoming data since our last meetingreinforce our expectation that net asset purchases under our Asset Purchase Programme (APP)should be concluded in the third quarter\u201d. So there is a much stronger affirmation of our assessment ofthe data, which, as you rightly pointed out, had indeed changed since five weeks ago. Now, obviously,this meeting was not a projection exercise. It was an interim Governing Council monetary policymeeting, and we affirmed the net asset purchases' very likely conclusion in the third quarter, without11/23/23, 4:20 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220414~fa5c8fe142.en.html 4/11being more specific, but being open-minded as to when in the quarter that is. It could be early; it couldbe late. The third quarter has three months, and I think the determination around the GoverningCouncil table was to take stock of the projection exercise at the next monetary policy meeting todetermine exactly the timing of such conclusion of the net asset purchases under the APP.On your second question about how many interest rate hikes are projected by markets, let me tell youthat we are sticking to our sequence, and this is very much what we did on the occasion of thisGoverning Council meeting. The sequence that we have adhered to, that we have agreed, is tocomplete net asset purchases first, and some time after that decide interest rate hike and subsequenthikes. I remember last time around on the occasion of the last monetary policy press conference, I wasasked specifically what was meant by the \u201csome time after\u201d. I repeat what I said at the time. \u201cSometime after\u201d is intended to serve our determination to have both optionality, gradualism and flexibility,which means that this \u201csome time after\u201d can be anywhere between a week to several months. Thatstands and remains true. So we will deal with interest rates when we get there.Let me ask you about the potential effect of an oil and gas embargo on inflation and theeconomic outlook. Have you been discussing that? Is that something which you think is arealistic scenario?My second question would be on how concerned you are about the tightening of financialconditions, so the lending channel. We have also seen yields on the rise for the corporatespace and for sovereigns. Is that something you are concerned about?On your first question concerning the potential boycott of oil and gas \u2013 and I'm assuming that you arereferring to oil and gas out of Russia, and the initiative of the boycott being either one party or theother, the supplier or the purchaser. Let me just, first of all, state that this Russian war against Ukraineis not just causing economic problems; it is causing a huge humanitarian crisis, massive economicdamages, and cost and risks way beyond Europe. I've noted the joint statement by the presidents ofinternational institutions [President Biden and President von der Leyen] to support that we all focusalso on the food crisis that is going to be hitting low-income countries and other people than theEuropeans. So let's put things in perspective first.Of course, on the oil and gas front, an abrupt boycott would have significant impact. Staff monitors thatvery carefully. Any such risk, obviously, reinforces the determination of the Europeans to move towardscleaner energy, to move to non-fossil fuel in general, and to reduce dependency vis-\u00e0-vis Russia. Buthave we actually factored in exactly the net amount, the trade-off resulting from any such boycott? No.We simply know that, obviously, some countries within the euro area will be more affected than others,and we also note that the Europeans together under the leadership of the Commission are looking atways to adopt joint approaches, joint policies, joint purchases. This certainly is, together with moving toa different energy mix, the right approach to take.The second part of your question dealt with the tightening of rates. I have commented on the banklending survey, which indicates that there is and there was during the first quarter a certain tighteningby a larger number of banks answering the surveys. All that being said, the volume of loans tohouseholds in particular still stands quite strongly. Lending to consumers \u2013 consumption loans \u2013 haveincreased. Corporate lending has stabilised for the moment. So even if there is tightening, particularlyconcerning the terms and conditions of those lending arrangements, in terms of both rate and volume", "5": "11/23/23, 4:09 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is181213.en.html 1/11INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEMario Draghi, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-Presidentof the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 13 December 2018Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council, whichwas also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Mr Centeno.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interestrates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through thesummer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustainedconvergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, our net purchases under the asset purchaseprogramme (APP) will end in December 2018. At the same time, we are enhancing our forwardguidance on reinvestment. Accordingly, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principalpayments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past thedate when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary tomaintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.While incoming information has been weaker than expected, reflecting softer external demand but alsosome country and sector-specific factors, the underlying strength of domestic demand continues tounderpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures. This supports ourconfidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim will proceed and will be maintainedeven after the end of our net asset purchases. At the same time, uncertainties related to geopoliticalfactors, the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatilityremain prominent. Significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up ofdomestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. Our forwardguidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock ofacquired assets, continues to provide the necessary degree of monetary accommodation for thesustained convergence of inflation to our aim. In any event, the Governing Council stands ready toadjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards theGoverning Council\u2019s inflation aim in a sustained manner.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro areareal GDP increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2018, following growth of 0.4%in the previous two quarters. The latest data and survey results have been weaker than expected,reflecting a diminishing contribution from external demand and some country and sector-specificfactors. While some of these factors are likely to unwind, this may suggest some slower growthmomentum ahead. At the same time, domestic demand, also backed by our accommodative monetaryJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:09 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is181213.en.html 2/11policy stance, continues to underpin the economic expansion in the euro area. The strength of thelabour market, as reflected in ongoing employment gains and rising wages, still supports privateconsumption. Moreover, business investment is benefiting from domestic demand, favourablefinancing conditions and improving balance sheets. Residential investment remains robust. In addition,the expansion in global activity is still expected to continue, supporting euro area exports, although ata slower pace.This assessment is broadly reflected in the December 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomicprojections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.9% in 2018,1.7% in 2019, 1.7% in 2020 and 1.5% in 2021. Compared with the September 2018 ECB staffmacroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised slightly down in 2018and 2019.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced.However, the balance of risks is moving to the downside owing to the persistence of uncertaintiesrelated to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets andfinancial market volatility.According to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation declined to 2.0% in November2018, from 2.2% in October, reflecting mainly a decline in energy inflation. On the basis of currentfutures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decrease over the coming months. Measures ofunderlying inflation remain generally muted, but domestic cost pressures are continuing to strengthenand broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, which is pushing upwage growth. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term,supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wagegrowth.This assessment is also broadly reflected in the December 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomicprojections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.8% in 2018, 1.6% in 2019, 1.7%in 2020 and 1.8% in 2021. Compared with the September 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections,the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised slightly up for 2018 and down for 2019.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth stood at 3.9% in October 2018, after3.6% in September. Apart from some volatility in monthly flows, M3 growth continues to be supportedby bank credit creation. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broadmoney growth.In line with the upward trend observed since the beginning of 2014, the growth of loans to the privatesector continues to support the economic expansion. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financialcorporations stood at 3.9% in October 2018, after 4.3% in September, while the annual growth rate ofloans to households remained unchanged at 3.2%. The pass-through of the monetary policy measuresput in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms andhouseholds, access to financing \u2013 in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises \u2013 and creditflows across the euro area.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for11/23/23, 4:09 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is181213.en.html 3/11the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over themedium term.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contributemore decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. Theimplementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up toincrease resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growthpotential. Regarding fiscal policies, the Governing Council reiterates the need for rebuilding fiscalbuffers. This is particularly important in countries where government debt is high and for which fulladherence to the Stability and Growth Pact is critical for safeguarding sound fiscal positions. Likewise,the transparent and consistent implementation of the EU\u2019s fiscal and economic governance frameworkover time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy.Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Councilwelcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the bankingunion and the capital markets union.Further information on the technical parameters of the reinvestments will be released at 15:30 CET onthe ECB\u2019s website.We are now at your disposal for questions.* * *When it comes to flexibility of the reinvestments, perhaps you could let us know how flexiblethe investments will be and whether you are planning to phase in the new capital key or not.Then I would like to ask you quite broadly about next year's economic risks, which are the risksyou are primarily focusing on, which could be big-event risks also for your outlook?Draghi: On the first question I think you have to wait for the press release at the end of this pressconference. But what I can do is to read you one of the decision-making points which is the one youare probably asking for. The Governing Council decides that under the PSPP, the public sectorpurchase programme, as a rule redemptions will be reinvested in the jurisdiction in which principalrepayments are made, but the portfolio allocation across jurisdictions will continue to be adjusted witha view to bringing the share of the PSPP portfolio into closer alignment with the respective nationalcentral bank subscription to the ECB capital key. That's what I can read to you now; the rest you willlearn from the press release.Now, your second question was about the risk. Well, in a sense that was the focal point of theGoverning Council discussion; what sort of assessment would the Governing Council give about. Andif I had to draw a conclusion about the sense that transpired from the discussion, I would summarise itwith just a few words; namely, continuing confidence with increasing caution. I just happened to read itbefore coming here; I will quote to you the results of a survey with small- and medium-sizedenterprises in a moment. Basically, they seem to say the same thing. So first of all when we look atwhat it is today, first of all we see that monetary policy remains very accommodative. As a matter offact, I think there is some sort of confusion here about termination. The APP is not terminating; itcontinues. It does continue because we are committed to maintaining the stock for an extended periodof time as it is. On top of that we have announced our forward guidance, we can come back on that.11/23/23, 4:09 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is181213.en.html 4/11When you look at the economy, well, you still see the drivers of this recovery are still in place.Consumption continues to grow, basically supported by the increase in real disposable income, which,if I am not mistaken, is at the historical high since six years or something, and households' wealth.Business investments continue to grow, residential investment, as I said in the IS [introductorystatement] is robust. External demand has gone down but still grows. Everything, all this when we lookat all these drivers of the recovery, yes, it's true, it's just weaker. It's not just one-off; it's been weakerfor a while now and that's in a sense the discussion \u2013 the sense of the discussion.Clearly, we ask ourselves first of all how quick this is, how weak this is and what causes thisweakness? We gave some explanations. You remember we started discussing this last time. There arecertain one-off factors in some countries, in some sectors which probably are transient, but there isalso a permanent component to this, which is the landing of the eurozone economy on a path, closerto potential. So we had in 2017 a pretty unusual year and so now there is some landing on a closerpath to potential.Now, what are the causes for this? Well, the introductory statement quoted uncertainty: geopoliticaluncertainty, emerging market economies' vulnerabilities, financial markets' volatility and perhapsanother cause. The point of this is that \u2013 yes, the threat of protectionism is the other. The other pointthat was discussed; all these are specific factors of uncertainty but generally speaking, these factorsmay change. For example, the trade situation based on the latest statements is probably better than itwas two months ago. Some emerging market vulnerabilities now seem to be less urgent or lessdangerous than they were two months ago. But in the meantime, others are looming up so the overallenvironment, the overall atmosphere has become one characterised by increased general uncertainty,which takes the shape now and then of different phenomena.I think this is at least considered by the Governing Council one of the reasons, if not the main reason,for this weaker data. You can see this because if you look back when we took this decision that wewould expect to terminate the APP, the net APP purchase now, back in June, well, since then what yousee is basically financing conditions that have been by and large the same, if not even moreaccommodative, with interest rates which went down, in fact, but risk premium has increased. That'swhat is at the root of some of the declines in asset prices. That's the sort of discussion and it's adiscussion, as I said, continued confidence with increasing caution.It's interesting in our usual periodic survey that we do with small- and medium-sized enterprises, nowthis survey terminates in September. They say that basically, the results are consistent with economicexpansion, which continues to be supported by accommodative financing conditions. NeverthelessSMEs signalled some rising concerns on their business environment. A large share of SMEs reportedhigher turnover, so positive news. But the percentage of firms indicating increasing profits declined.You see, all this is news of lower growth but not low growth. This was the key point. The other resultsare basically consistent with this two-phased assessment of the situation.I have two questions about the enhanced forward guidance on reinvestments that you havepublished today. The first one is, you say that reinvestments will continue in full for anextended period after the first increase in rate hikes. Can you give some more details abouthow long this extended period is? Generally it is understood by investors that reinvestments", "6": "11/23/23, 4:16 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is191212~c9e1a6ab3e.en.html 1/12INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 12 December 2019Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our press conference. Today is the first time that I have had theprivilege and pleasure of chairing the monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Iam delighted to proceed now with reporting on the outcome of our meeting, together with the Vice-President. The Governing Council meeting was also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interestrates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen theinflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projectionhorizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.On 1 November we restarted net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) at a monthlypace of \u20ac20 billion. We expect them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodativeimpact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates.We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the keyECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditionsand an ample degree of monetary accommodation.The incoming data since the last Governing Council meeting in late October point to continued mutedinflation pressures and weak euro area growth dynamics, although there are some initial signs ofstabilisation in the growth slowdown and of a mild increase in underlying inflation in line with previousexpectations. Ongoing employment growth and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilienceof the euro area economy.The comprehensive package of policy measures that the Governing Council decided in Septemberprovides substantial monetary stimulus, which ensures favourable financing conditions for all sectorsof the economy. In particular, easier borrowing conditions for firms and households are underpinningconsumer spending and business investment. This will support the euro area expansion, the ongoingbuild-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the robust convergence of inflation to our medium-termaim.In the light of the subdued inflation outlook, the Governing Council reiterated the need for monetarypolicy to remain highly accommodative for a prolonged period of time to support underlying inflationpressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. We will, therefore, closelymonitor inflation developments and the impact of the unfolding monetary policy measures on theeconomy. Our forward guidance will ensure that financial conditions adjust in accordance with changesJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:16 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is191212~c9e1a6ab3e.en.html 2/12to the inflation outlook. In any case, the Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of itsinstruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, inline with its commitment to symmetry.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro areareal GDP growth was confirmed at 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2019, unchangedfrom the previous quarter. The ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of persistentglobal uncertainties continues to weigh on the euro area manufacturing sector and is dampeninginvestment growth. At the same time, incoming economic data and survey information, while remainingweak overall, point to some stabilisation in the slowdown of economic growth in the euro area. Theservices and construction sectors remain resilient, despite some moderation in the latter half of 2019.Looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financingconditions, further employment gains in conjunction with rising wages, the mildly expansionary euroarea fiscal stance and the ongoing \u2013 albeit somewhat slower \u2013 growth in global activity.This assessment is broadly reflected in the December 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomicprojections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.2% in 2019,1.1% in 2020 and 1.4% in both 2021 and 2022. Compared with the September 2019 ECB staffmacroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised down slightly for 2020.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook, related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionismand vulnerabilities in emerging markets, remain tilted to the downside, but have become somewhatless pronounced.According to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation increased from 0.7% inOctober 2019 to 1.0% in November, reflecting mainly higher services and food price inflation. On thebasis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to rise somewhat in the coming months.Indicators of inflation expectations stand at low levels. Measures of underlying inflation have remainedgenerally muted, although there are some indications of a mild increase in line with previousexpectations. While labour cost pressures have strengthened amid tighter labour markets, the weakergrowth momentum is delaying their pass-through to inflation. Over the medium term, inflation isexpected to increase, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansionand solid wage growth.This assessment is also broadly reflected in the December 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomicprojections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.2% in 2019, 1.1% in 2020, 1.4%in 2021 and 1.6% in 2022. Compared with the September 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections,the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised up slightly for 2020 and down slightly for 2021, mainlydriven by the expected future path of energy prices.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth stood at 5.6% in October 2019,unchanged from the previous month. Sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bankcredit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3 relative to other financialinstruments. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continues to be the main contributor to broad moneygrowth on the components side.11/23/23, 4:16 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is191212~c9e1a6ab3e.en.html 3/12The growth of loans to firms and households remained solid, benefiting from the continued pass-through of our accommodative monetary policy stance to bank lending rates. The annual growth rateof loans to non-financial corporations increased to 3.8% in October, up from 3.6% in September, whilethe annual growth rate of loans to households continued on its gradual upward path, reaching 3.5% inOctober. Our accommodative monetary policy stance will help to safeguard very favourable banklending conditions and will continue to support access to financing, across all economic sectors and inparticular for small and medium-sized enterprises.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary forthe continued robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over themedium term.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contributemore decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential, supporting aggregate demand at thecurrent juncture and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural policies in euro areacountries needs to be substantially stepped up to boost euro area productivity and growth potential,reduce structural unemployment and increase resilience. The 2019 country-specific recommendationsshould serve as the relevant signpost.Regarding fiscal policies, the euro area fiscal stance is expected to remain mildly expansionary in2020, thus providing support to economic activity. In view of the weakened economic outlook, theGoverning Council welcomes the Eurogroup\u2019s call for differentiated fiscal responses and its readinessto coordinate. Governments with fiscal space should be ready to act in an effective and timely manner.In countries where public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudent policies and meetstructural balance targets, which will create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely. Allcountries should intensify their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances.Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the European Union\u2019s fiscal and economicgovernance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience ofthe euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority.The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps tocomplete the banking union and the capital markets union.We are now at your disposal for questions.* * *President Lagarde: Before the questions I'm going to take just a couple of minutes of your time to tellyou a few things. One is, each and every President has his or her own style of communicating. I knowsome of you are keen to compare and rate or rank. I will have my own style. As I've said before, don'tover-interpret, don't second-guess, don't cross-reference. I'm going to be myself and thereforeprobably different. Point number 1. Point number 2, this introductory statement probably rings a fewbells for those of you who follow those documents very carefully. But some of you will be disappointedthat it does not include anything having to do with the strategic review. It is intended to be that way, sothe introductory statement does not include, does not refer and should not be associated with thestrategic review that we are considering. I'll be happy to give you \u2013 I can do that now actually if you11/23/23, 4:16 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is191212~c9e1a6ab3e.en.html 4/12want \u2013 a little bit of my thinking and our collective thinking on the strategic review because I know thatit is of interest to some of you. Shall I do that now? Yes, that's easier, and then you can ask questions!First of all, there is nothing unusual or extraordinary about having a strategic review. I actually considerfor myself that it's a little bit overdue. Legitimately so, because there were many other things to do butthe last strategic review was in 2003. It's been 16 years since there has been a strategic review, so it'squite legitimate to have a strategic review at this point in time.Second, that strategic review needs to be comprehensive, needs to look at all and every issue, willturn each and every stone and will take its time but will not take too much time. By that I mean my planis to actually get the review started in the course of January. Don't ask me which week or which day orwhich second, but it will be in the course of January. Our goal is to complete it before the end of 2020.Third, about the strategic review, it will be reaching out to not just the usual suspects, but it will alsoinclude consulting with Members of Parliament and I've committed to that with the EuropeanParliament. It will reach out to the academic community, of course. It will reach out to civil societyrepresentatives and it will aim at not just preaching the gospel that we think we master, but alsolistening to the views of those to whom we reach out. It is the point of every strategic review by allcentral banks that are conducting this exercise to actually look at their objective, how they define theirmedium-term objective in particular, how they give content to the price stability that is in their mandate,and it is the only objective that we have in our mandate ourselves. So that topic indeed will be coreand centre to our strategic review. There is no preconceived landing zone at this point in time.Indeed it will also address the major changes that have taken place over the course of the last 16years, and by that I include the massive technological change that our societies are facing. It willinclude the immense challenge that climate change is addressing to each and every one of us,wherever located, and whatever our mission and duties. It will include aspects of inequality that arecertainly rising in our economies, and all of those will be addressed with a view to exploring each andevery corner of the business that we conduct as a central bank to see how those businesses areaffected and how we can take them into account to better respond to the mission that we have, and todeliver on our mandate: serving the euro area citizens, and delivering on the mandate of price stability.That's on the strategic review, and if you have additional points that I can answer, I will.But I will not go into much further details when it comes to the substance, because the framework hasnot yet been completely agreed and discussed with members of the Governing Council. I havecertainly made a point of my tenure to include members of the Governing Council and to seek theirviews and their consideration before any decision is made.Let me add I have huge respect for the work that you do. You are a main audience for the centralbank. But you are not the only audience, and I would also encourage you not to try to draw too manyconclusions or decisive findings from communication that I would address to a different audience witha slightly different language in order to be maybe better understood by those who do not have yourlevel of skills and in-depth knowledge of the matters that we deal with. With that, I am happy to takequestions. Christine is going to monitor that. When I don't know, I will tell you that I don't know! Maybeyou will know, Luis.", "7": "11/23/23, 4:08 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is201210~9b8e5f3cdd.en.html 1/12INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 10 December 2020Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council, whichwas also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.While the rebound of economic activity in the third quarter was stronger than expected and theprospects for the roll-out of vaccines are encouraging, the pandemic continues to pose serious risks topublic health and to the euro area and global economies. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases and theassociated containment measures are significantly restricting euro area economic activity, which isexpected to have contracted in the fourth quarter of 2020. While activity in the manufacturing sectorcontinues to hold up well, services activity is being severely curbed by the increase in infection ratesand the new restrictions on social interaction and mobility. Inflation remains very low in the context ofweak demand and significant slack in labour and product markets. Overall, the incoming data and ourstaff projections suggest a more pronounced near-term impact of the pandemic on the economy and amore protracted weakness in inflation than previously envisaged.In view of the economic fallout from the resurgence of the pandemic, today the Governing Councilrecalibrated its monetary policy instruments as follows:First, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect themto remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to alevel sufficiently close to, but below, 2 per cent within our projection horizon, and such convergencehas been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.Second, we decided to increase the envelope of the pandemic emergency purchase programme(PEPP) by \u20ac500 billion to a total of \u20ac1,850 billion. We also extended the horizon for net purchasesunder the PEPP to at least the end of March 2022. In any case, we will conduct net purchases until theGoverning Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over.We will conduct our purchases under the PEPP to preserve favourable financing conditions over thisextended period. We will purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view topreventing a tightening of financing conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downwardimpact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. In addition, the flexibility of purchases overtime, across asset classes and among jurisdictions will continue to support the smooth transmission ofmonetary policy. If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows thatdo not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not beJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:08 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is201210~9b8e5f3cdd.en.html 2/12used in full. Equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financingconditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.The extension of our PEPP purchases over a longer horizon reflects the prolonged fallout from thepandemic for the economy and inflation. It allows for a continuous market presence and more durablesupport from our monetary stimulus. Preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemicperiod will help to reduce uncertainty and bolster confidence, thereby encouraging consumer spendingand business investment, and, ultimately, underpinning the economic recovery and helping to offsetthe downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation.We also decided to extend the reinvestment of principal payments from maturing securities purchasedunder the PEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio willbe managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.Third, the Governing Council decided to further recalibrate the conditions of the third series of targetedlonger-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). Specifically, we decided to extend the period overwhich considerably more favourable terms will apply by twelve months, to June 2022. We will alsoconduct three additional operations between June and December 2021. Moreover, we decided to raisethe total amount that counterparties will be entitled to borrow in TLTRO III operations from 50 per centto 55 per cent of their stock of eligible loans. In order to provide an incentive for banks to sustain thecurrent level of bank lending, the recalibrated TLTRO III borrowing conditions will be made availableonly to banks that achieve a new lending performance target. The extension of the pandemic-relatedlow interest rate period under TLTRO III, the addition of more operations and the increase in theamount that can potentially be borrowed will preserve the very attractive funding conditions for banks.This will help to ensure that they can continue to offer favourable lending conditions and have ampleliquidity to extend loans to households and firms.Fourth, we decided to extend to June 2022 the duration of the set of collateral easing measuresadopted by the Governing Council on 7 and 22 April 2020. The extension of these measures willcontinue to ensure that banks can make full use of the Eurosystem\u2019s liquidity operations, most notablythe recalibrated TLTROs. The Governing Council will reassess the collateral easing measures beforeJune 2022, ensuring that Eurosystem counterparties\u2019 participation in TLTRO III operations is notadversely affected.Fifth, the Governing Council also decided to offer four additional pandemic emergency longer-termrefinancing operations (PELTROs) in 2021, which will continue to provide an effective liquiditybackstop.Sixth, net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of\u20ac20 billion. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long asnecessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before westart raising the key ECB interest rates.We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the keyECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditionsand an ample degree of monetary accommodation.11/23/23, 4:08 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is201210~9b8e5f3cdd.en.html 3/12Seventh, the Eurosystem repo facility for central banks (EUREP) and all temporary swap and repolines with non-euro area central banks will be extended until March 2022.Finally, we decided to continue conducting our regular lending operations as fixed rate tenderprocedures with full allotment at the prevailing conditions for as long as necessary.Separate press releases with further details of the measures taken by the Governing Council will bepublished this afternoon at 15:30 CET.The monetary policy measures taken today will contribute to preserving favourable financingconditions over the pandemic period, thereby supporting the flow of credit to all sectors of theeconomy, underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability. At the sametime, uncertainty remains high, including with regard to the dynamics of the pandemic and the timing ofvaccine roll-outs. We will also continue to monitor developments in the exchange rate with regard totheir possible implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. We therefore continue to stand readyto adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards our aim in asustained manner, in line with our commitment to symmetry.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Followinga sharp contraction in the first half of 2020, euro area real GDP rebounded strongly and rose by 12.5per cent, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter, although remaining well below pre-pandemic levels.The second wave of the pandemic and the associated intensification of containment measuresobserved since mid-October are expected to result in a renewed significant decline in activity in thefourth quarter, although to a much lesser extent than observed in the second quarter of this year.Economic developments continue to be uneven across sectors, with activity in the services sectorbeing more adversely affected by the new restrictions on social interaction and mobility than activity inthe industrial sector. Although fiscal policy measures are supporting households and firms, consumersremain cautious in the light of the pandemic and its ramifications for employment and earnings.Moreover, weaker balance sheets and uncertainty about the economic outlook are weighing onbusiness investment.Looking ahead, the news of prospective roll-outs of vaccines allows for greater confidence in theassumption of a gradual resolution of the health crisis. However, it will take time until widespreadimmunity is achieved, while further resurgences in infections, with challenges to public health andeconomic prospects, cannot be ruled out. Over the medium term, the recovery of the euro areaeconomy should be supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and arecovery in demand as containment measures are lifted and uncertainty recedes.This assessment is broadly reflected in the baseline scenario of the December 2020 Eurosystem staffmacroeconomic projections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP growth at-7.3 per cent in 2020, 3.9 per cent in 2021, 4.2 per cent in 2022 and 2.1 per cent in 2023. Comparedwith the September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for economic activity hasbeen revised down in the short term, but is seen to broadly recover to the level projected in theSeptember baseline scenario over the medium term.Overall, the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, but havebecome less pronounced. While the news about the prospects for vaccine roll-outs in the near future is11/23/23, 4:08 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is201210~9b8e5f3cdd.en.html 4/12encouraging, downside risks remain related to the implications of the pandemic for economic andfinancial conditions.According to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual inflation remained unchanged at -0.3 per centin November. On the basis of oil price dynamics and taking into account the temporary reduction in theGerman VAT rate, headline inflation is likely to remain negative until early 2021. Thereafter, it isexpected to increase owing to the end of the temporary VAT reduction in Germany and upward baseeffects in energy price inflation. At the same time, underlying price pressures are expected to remainsubdued owing to weak demand, notably in the tourism and travel-related sectors, as well as to lowwage pressures and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate. Once the impact of the pandemicfades, a recovery in demand, supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, will putupward pressure on inflation over the medium term. Market-based indicators and survey-basedmeasures of longer-term inflation expectations remain at low levels.This assessment is broadly reflected in the baseline scenario of the December 2020 Eurosystem staffmacroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresees annual inflation at 0.2 per cent in 2020,1.0 per cent in 2021, 1.1 per cent in 2022 and 1.4 per cent in 2023. Compared with the September2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for inflation has been revised down for 2020and 2022.Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth of broad money (M3) remained broadlyunchanged at 10.5 per cent in October 2020. Strong money growth has been supported by theongoing asset purchases by the Eurosystem, which have become the largest source of moneycreation. In the context of a still heightened preference for liquidity in the money-holding sector and alow opportunity cost of holding the most liquid forms of money, the narrow monetary aggregate M1continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth.The growth of lending to the private sector has plateaued, while still recording higher growth rates thanprior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following strong increases in the early months of the pandemic, theannual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations fell to 6.8 per cent in October, after 7.1 percent in September. This deceleration has occurred in the context of abating emergency liquidity needs,weak investment and tighter credit conditions on loans to firms, as signalled by our bank lendingsurvey for the euro area for the third quarter of 2020. The annual growth rate of loans to householdsstood at 3.1 per cent in October, unchanged from September.Overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments andEuropean institutions, remain essential to support bank lending conditions and access to financing, inparticular for those most affected by the ramifications of the pandemic.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary tosupport economic activity and the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to,2 per cent over the medium term.Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of thesharp contraction in the euro area economy. Fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemicemergency should, as much as possible, be targeted and temporary in nature. At the same time, weak", "8": "11/23/23, 4:10 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is211216~9abaace28e.en.html 1/13MONET ARY POLICY  STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 16 December 2021The first paragraph of the last question was updated on 17 December 2021 at 14:40 to correct atranscription error.Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.The euro area economy continues to recover and the labour market is improving, helped by amplepolicy support. Growth is moderating but we expect activity to pick up again strongly in the course ofnext year. The latest pandemic wave and the Omicron variant have prompted some countries to re-introduce tighter restrictions. Energy prices have gone up significantly. And in some industries, thereare shortages of materials, equipment and labour. These factors are restraining economic activity andare a headwind for the near-term outlook. However, although the public health crisis is still ongoing,many people have been vaccinated and booster campaigns have accelerated. Overall, society hasbecome better at coping with the pandemic waves and resulting constraints. This has lessened thepandemic impact on the economy. Inflation has risen sharply owing to the surge in energy prices, andalso because demand is outpacing constrained supply in some sectors. Inflation is expected to remainelevated in the near term, but should ease in the course of next year. The inflation outlook has beenrevised up, but inflation is still projected to settle below our two per cent target over the projectionhorizon.We judge that the progress on economic recovery and towards our medium-term inflation targetpermits a step-by-step reduction in the pace of our asset purchases over the coming quarters. Butmonetary accommodation is still needed for inflation to stabilise at our two per cent inflation target overthe medium term. In view of the current uncertainty, we need to maintain flexibility and optionality in theconduct of monetary policy. With this is mind, the Governing Council took the following decisions:First, in the first quarter of 2022, we expect to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemicemergency purchase programme (PEPP) at a lower pace than in the previous quarter. We willdiscontinue net asset purchases under the PEPP at the end of March 2022.Second, the Governing Council decided to extend the reinvestment horizon for the PEPP. It nowintends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until atleast the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoidinterference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.Third, the pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and conduct ofasset purchases has helped to counter the impaired transmission of our monetary policy and made ourJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:10 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is211216~9abaace28e.en.html 2/13efforts to achieve our goal more effective. Within our mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility willremain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardisethe attainment of price stability. In particular, in the event of renewed market fragmentation related tothe pandemic, PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes andjurisdictions at any time. This could include purchasing bonds issued by the Hellenic Republic over andabove rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, whichcould impair the transmission of monetary policy to the Greek economy while it is still recovering fromthe fallout of the pandemic. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, tocounter negative shocks related to the pandemic.Fourth, in line with a step-by-step reduction in asset purchases and to ensure that the monetary policystance remains consistent with inflation stabilising at our target over the medium term, we decided ona monthly net purchase pace of \u20ac40 billion in the second quarter and \u20ac30 billion in the third quarterunder the asset purchase programme (APP). From October 2022 onwards, we will maintain net assetpurchases under the APP at a monthly pace of \u20ac20 billion for as long as necessary to reinforce theaccommodative impact of our policy rates. We expect net purchases to end shortly before we startraising the key ECB interest rates.We also confirmed the level of the key ECB interest rates and our forward guidance on the future pathof policy rates. This is crucial for maintaining the appropriate degree of accommodation to stabiliseinflation at our two per cent inflation target over the medium term.We will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of TLTRO IIIoperations does not hamper the smooth transmission of our monetary policy. We will also regularlyassess how targeted lending operations are contributing to our monetary policy stance. As announced,we expect the special conditions applicable under TLTRO III to end in June next year. We will alsoassess the appropriate calibration of our two-tier system for reserve remuneration so that the negativeinterest rate policy does not limit banks\u2019 intermediation capacity in an environment of ample excessliquidity.The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate and in eitherdirection, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its two per cent target over the medium term.I will now outline in more detail how we see developments in the economy and inflation. I will thenoutline our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityWe expect the economic recovery to continue, driven by robust domestic demand. The labour marketis improving, with more people having jobs and fewer in job retention schemes. This supports theprospect of rising household income and consumption. The savings built up during the pandemic willalso support consumption. The current fiscal and monetary policy support, together with a continuedglobal recovery, should support growth.Economic activity has been moderating over the final quarter of the year and this slower growth islikely to extend into the early part of next year. We now expect output to exceed its pre-pandemic levelin the first quarter of 2022.11/23/23, 4:10 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is211216~9abaace28e.en.html 3/13To cope with the current pandemic wave, some euro area countries have reintroduced tightercontainment measures. This could delay the recovery, especially in travel, tourism, hospitality andentertainment. The pandemic is weighing on consumer and business confidence and the spread ofnew virus variants is creating extra uncertainty. In addition, rising energy costs are a headwind forconsumption.Shortages of equipment, materials and labour in some sectors are hampering production ofmanufactured goods, causing delays in construction and slowing down the recovery in some parts ofthe service sector. These bottlenecks will still be with us for some time, but they should ease during2022.Looking ahead, we expect growth to rebound strongly over the course of 2022. Our new Eurosystemstaff projections foresee annual real GDP growth at 5.1 per cent in 2021, 4.2 per cent in 2022, 2.9 percent in 2023 and 1.6 per cent in 2024. Compared with our September staff projections, the outlook hasbeen revised down for 2022 and up for 2023.Targeted and growth-friendly fiscal measures should continue to complement monetary policy. Thissupport will also help the economy adjust to the structural changes that are under way. An effectiveimplementation of the Next Generation EU programme and the \u201cFit for 55\u201d package will contribute to astronger, greener and more even recovery across euro area countries.InflationInflation increased further to 4.9 per cent in November. It will remain above two per cent for most of2022. Inflation is expected to remain elevated in the near term, but we expect it to decline in thecourse of next year.The upswing in inflation primarily reflects a sharp rise in prices for fuel, gas and electricity. InNovember, energy inflation accounted for more than half of headline inflation. Demand also continuesto outpace constrained supply in certain sectors. The consequences are especially visible in the pricesof durable goods and those consumer services that have recently reopened. Base effects related tothe end of the VAT cut in Germany are still contributing to higher inflation, but only until the end of theyear.There is uncertainty as to how long it will take for these issues to resolve. But, in the course of 2022,we expect energy prices to stabilise, consumption patterns to normalise, and price pressuresstemming from global supply bottlenecks to subside.Over time, the gradual return of the economy to full capacity and further improvements in the labourmarket should support faster growth in wages. Market and survey-based measures of longer-terminflation expectations have remained broadly stable since our last monetary policy meeting in October.But overall, these have moved closer to two per cent in recent months. These factors will helpunderlying inflation to move up and bring headline inflation up to our target over the medium term.Our new staff projections foresee annual inflation at 2.6 per cent in 2021, 3.2 per cent in 2022, 1.8 percent in 2023, and 1.8 per cent in 2024 \u2013 significantly higher than in the previous projections inSeptember. Inflation excluding food and energy is projected to average 1.4 per cent in 2021, 1.9 per11/23/23, 4:10 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is211216~9abaace28e.en.html 4/13cent in 2022, 1.7 per cent in 2023, and 1.8 per cent in 2024, also higher than in the Septemberprojections.Risk assessmentWe see the risks to the economic outlook as broadly balanced. Economic activity could outperform ourexpectations if consumers become more confident and save less than expected. By contrast, therecent worsening of the pandemic, including the spread of new variants, could be a more persistentdrag on growth. The future path of energy prices and the pace at which supply bottlenecks areresolved are risks to the recovery and to the outlook for inflation. If price pressures feed through intohigher than anticipated wage rises or the economy returns more quickly to full capacity, inflation couldturn out to be higher.Financial and monetary conditionsMarket interest rates have remained broadly stable since the October Governing Council meeting.Bank lending rates for firms and households remain at historically low levels. Overall, financingconditions for the economy remain favourable. Lending to firms is partly driven by short-term fundingneeds stemming from supply bottlenecks that increase their expenses for inventory and workingcapital. At the same time, corporate demand for loans remains moderate because of retained earningsand generous cash holdings, as well as high debt. Lending to households remains robust \u2013 driven bydemand for mortgages.Euro area banks have further strengthened their balance sheets thanks to higher capital ratios andfewer non-performing loans. Banks are now as profitable as they were before the pandemic. Bankfunding conditions remain favourable overall.In line with our new monetary policy strategy, twice a year the Governing Council assesses in-depththe interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability. An accommodative monetary policyunderpins growth, which supports the balance sheets of companies and financial institutions, as wellas preventing risks of market fragmentation. At the same time, the impact of accommodative monetarypolicy on property markets and financial markets warrants close monitoring as a number of medium-term vulnerabilities have intensified. Still, macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence inpreserving financial stability and addressing medium-term vulnerabilities.ConclusionSumming up, the euro area economy continues to recover, despite a slowdown in the near term. Thesharp increase in energy prices and demand outpacing constrained supply in some sectors arepushing up inflation. Inflation will remain above our target for most of 2022, but is likely to ease in thecourse of next year. At the same time, given the progress on economic recovery and towards ourmedium-term inflation target, we can discontinue net purchases under the PEPP in March. Butmonetary accommodation is still needed \u2013 including net purchases under the APP and our forwardguidance on interest rates \u2013 for inflation to stabilise at our two per cent inflation target over the mediumterm.We are now ready to take your questions.", "9": "11/23/23, 3:50 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is221215~197ac630ae.en.html 1/12MONET ARY POLICY  STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 15 December 2022Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.The Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and,based on the substantial upward revision to the inflation outlook, we expect to raise them further. Inparticular, we judge that interest rates will still have to rise significantly at a steady pace to reach levelsthat are sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-termtarget. Keeping interest rates at restrictive levels will over time reduce inflation by dampening demandand will also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. Our futurepolicy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach.The key ECB interest rates are our primary tool for setting the monetary policy stance. The GoverningCouncil today also discussed principles for normalising the Eurosystem\u2019s monetary policy securitiesholdings. From the beginning of March 2023 onwards, the asset purchase programme (APP) portfoliowill decline at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem will not reinvest all of the principalpayments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to \u20ac15 billion per month on average untilthe end of the second quarter of 2023 and its subsequent pace will be determined over time.At its February meeting the Governing Council will announce the detailed parameters for reducing theAPP holdings. The Governing Council will regularly reassess the pace of the APP portfolio reduction toensure it remains consistent with the overall monetary policy strategy and stance, to preserve marketfunctioning, and to maintain firm control over short-term money market conditions. By the end of 2023,we will also review our operational framework for steering short-term interest rates, which will provideinformation regarding the endpoint of the balance sheet normalisation process.We decided to raise interest rates today, and expect to raise them significantly further, becauseinflation remains far too high and is projected to stay above our target for too long. According toEurostat\u2019s flash estimate, inflation was 10.0 per cent in November, slightly lower than the 10.6 per centrecorded in October. The decline resulted mainly from lower energy price inflation. Food price inflationand underlying price pressures across the economy have strengthened and will persist for some time.Amid exceptional uncertainty, Eurosystem staff have significantly revised up their inflation projections.They now see average inflation reaching 8.4 per cent in 2022 before decreasing to 6.3 per cent in2023, with inflation expected to decline markedly over the course of the year. Inflation is then projectedto average 3.4 per cent in 2024 and 2.3 per cent in 2025. Inflation excluding energy and food isprojected to be 3.9 per cent on average in 2022 and to rise to 4.2 per cent in 2023, before falling to 2.8per cent in 2024 and 2.4 per cent in 2025.Jump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 3:50 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is221215~197ac630ae.en.html 2/12The euro area economy may contract in the current quarter and the next quarter, owing to the energycrisis, high uncertainty, weakening global economic activity and tighter financing conditions. Accordingto the latest Eurosystem staff projections, a recession would be relatively short-lived and shallow.Growth is nonetheless expected to be subdued next year and has been revised down significantlycompared with the previous projections. Beyond the near term, growth is projected to recover as thecurrent headwinds fade. Overall, the Eurosystem staff projections now see the economy growing by3.4 per cent in 2022, 0.5 per cent in 2023, 1.9 per cent in 2024 and 1.8 per cent in 2025.The decisions taken today are set out in a  available on our website.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explainour assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityEconomic growth in the euro area slowed to 0.3 per cent in the third quarter of the year. High inflationand tighter financing conditions are dampening spending and production by reducing real householdincomes and pushing up costs for firms.The world economy is also slowing, in a context of continued geopolitical uncertainty, especially owingto Russia\u2019s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people, and tighter financing conditions worldwide.The past deterioration in the terms of trade, reflecting the faster rise in import prices than in exportprices, continues to weigh on purchasing power in the euro area.On the positive side, employment increased by 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, and unemployment hita new historical low of 6.5 per cent in October. Rising wages are set to restore some lost purchasingpower, supporting consumption. As the economy weakens, however, job creation is likely to slow, andunemployment could rise over the coming quarters.Fiscal support measures to shield the economy from the impact of high energy prices should betemporary, targeted and tailored to preserving incentives to consume less energy. Fiscal measuresfalling short of these principles are likely to exacerbate inflationary pressures, which would necessitatea stronger monetary policy response. Moreover, in line with the EU\u2019s economic governance framework,fiscal policies should be oriented towards making our economy more productive and gradually bringingdown high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area\u2019s supply capacity, especially in the energysector, can help reduce price pressures in the medium term. To that end, governments should swiftlyimplement their investment and structural reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme.The reform of the EU\u2019s economic governance framework should be concluded rapidly.InflationInflation declined to 10.0 per cent in November, mainly on the back of lower energy price inflation,while services inflation also edged down. Food price inflation rose further to 13.6 per cent, however, ashigh input costs in food production were passed through to consumer prices.Price pressures remain strong across sectors, partly as a result of the impact of high energy coststhroughout the economy. Inflation excluding energy and food was unchanged in November, at 5.0 percent, and other measures of underlying inflation are also high. Fiscal measures to compensatepress release11/23/23, 3:50 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is221215~197ac630ae.en.html 3/12households for high energy prices and inflation are set to dampen inflation over next year but will raiseit once they are withdrawn.Supply bottlenecks are gradually easing, although their effects are still contributing to inflation, pushingup goods prices in particular. The same holds true for the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions: whileweakening, the effect of pent-up demand is still driving up prices, especially in the services sector. Thedepreciation of the euro this year is also continuing to feed through to consumer prices.Wage growth is strengthening, supported by robust labour markets and some catch-up in wages tocompensate workers for high inflation. As these factors are set to remain in place, the Eurosystem staffprojections see wages growing at rates well above historical averages and pushing up inflationthroughout the projection period. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently standat around two per cent, although further above-target revisions to some indicators warrant continuedmonitoring.Risk assessmentRisks to the economic growth outlook are on the downside, especially in the near term. The waragainst Ukraine remains a significant downside risk to the economy. Energy and food costs could alsoremain persistently higher than expected. There could be an additional drag on growth in the euro areaif the world economy were to weaken more sharply than we expect.The risks to the inflation outlook are primarily on the upside. In the near term, existing pipelinepressures could lead to stronger than expected rises in retail prices for energy and food. Over themedium term, risks stem primarily from domestic factors such as a persistent rise in inflationexpectations above our target or higher than anticipated wage rises. By contrast, a decline in energycosts or a further weakening of demand would lower price pressures.Financial and monetary conditionsAs we tighten monetary policy, borrowing is becoming more expensive for firms and households. Banklending to firms remains robust, as firms replace bonds with bank loans and use credit to finance thehigher costs of production and investment. Households are borrowing less, because of tighter creditstandards, rising interest rates, worsening prospects for the housing market and lower consumerconfidence.In line with our monetary policy strategy, twice a year the Governing Council assesses in depth theinterrelation between monetary policy and financial stability. The financial stability environment hasdeteriorated since our last review in June 2022 owing to a weaker economy and rising credit risk. Inaddition, sovereign vulnerabilities have risen amid the weaker economic outlook and weaker fiscalpositions. Tighter financing conditions would mitigate the build-up of financial vulnerabilities and lowertail risks to inflation over the medium term, at the cost of a higher risk of systemic stress and greaterdownside risks to growth in the short term. In addition, the liquidity needs of non-bank financialinstitutions may amplify market volatility. At the same time, euro area banks have comfortable levels ofcapital, which helps to reduce the side effects of tighter monetary policy on financial stability.Macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence in preserving financial stability and addressingmedium-term vulnerabilities.11/23/23, 3:50 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is221215~197ac630ae.en.html 4/12ConclusionSumming up, we have today raised the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and, based onthe substantial upward revision to our inflation outlook, we expect to raise them further. In particular,we judge that interest rates will still have to rise significantly at a steady pace to reach levels that aresufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target.Keeping interest rates at restrictive levels will over time reduce inflation by dampening demand and willalso guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. Moreover, from thebeginning of March 2023 onwards, the APP portfolio will decline at a measured and predictable pace,as the Eurosystem will not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities.Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and determined meeting bymeeting. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflationreturns to our medium-term inflation target.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *I have two questions. One on \u201cthe significantly higher rates at a steady pace\u201d. Does that meanwe are going to see more 50-basis-point hikes in the future? And how many do you envision ifyou see significantly higher rates?On QT, quantitative tightening, how do you decide which one do you reinvest and which not? Isthere also a metric behind?On the first one, I\u2019m glad that you picked up the key messages that are really embedded in thismonetary policy statement that I have just read for you. One of the key messages, in addition to thehike that we decided today, is the indication that not only will we raise interest rates further, which issomething that we had said before, but we also say that today we judged that interest rates will stillhave to rise significantly at a steady pace to reach levels that are sufficiently restrictive, to ensure atimely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target. I\u2019m reading straight from the monetary policystatement, first paragraph, because that is the one that that really includes the four key messages thatwe have. One of them is that we, at this point in time, expect and judge that we will have to raiseinterest rates significantly. Now, what does that mean? You have to read it together with the steadypace. It is pretty much obvious that, on the basis of the data that we have at the moment, significantrise at a steady pace means that we should expect to raise interest rates at a 50-basis-point pace for aperiod of time.The second element that you have in this paragraph is the reference to a steady pace, so it\u2019ssignificant, and it has to be a steady pace, which means that we have made progress over the courseof the last few months, but we have more ground to cover. We have longer to go, and we are in for along game.On your second question, which is relating to the second part of our decision, about the quantitativetightening, or the reduction of the size of our balance sheet, where we decided the key principles, sopredictable, measured, and we had said that at this particular meeting we would come with keyprinciples. Clearly, the first principle is the starting point, which we have agreed would be early March2023. And we have also agreed on the monthly average calculated over a period of four months until", "10": "11/23/23, 4:09 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220203~ca7001dec0.en.html 1/12MONET ARY POLICY  STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 3 February 2022Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.The euro area economy is continuing to recover and the labour market is improving further, helped byample policy support. But growth is likely to remain subdued in the first quarter, as the currentpandemic wave is still weighing on economic activity. Shortages of materials, equipment and labourcontinue to hold back output in some industries. High energy costs are hurting incomes and are likelyto dampen spending. However, the economy is affected less and less by each wave of the pandemicand the factors restraining production and consumption should gradually ease, allowing the economyto pick up again strongly in the course of the year.Inflation has risen sharply in recent months and it has further surprised to the upside in January. This isprimarily driven by higher energy costs that are pushing up prices across many sectors, as well ashigher food prices. Inflation is likely to remain elevated for longer than previously expected, but todecline in the course of this year.The Governing Council therefore confirmed the decisions taken at its monetary policy meeting lastDecember, as detailed in the  published at 13:45 today. Accordingly, we will continuereducing the pace of our asset purchases step by step over the coming quarters, and will end netpurchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) at the end of March. In viewof the current uncertainty, we need more than ever to maintain flexibility and optionality in the conductof monetary policy. The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate,to ensure that inflation stabilises at its two per cent target over the medium term.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing, and will then talkabout our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityEconomic growth weakened to 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year. Nevertheless, outputreached its pre-pandemic level at the end of 2021. Economic activity and demand will likely remainmuted in the early part of this year for several reasons. First, containment measures are affectingconsumer services, especially travel, tourism, hospitality and entertainment. Although infection ratesare still very high, the impact of the pandemic on economic life is now proving less damaging. Second,high energy costs are reducing the purchasing power of households and the earnings of businesses,which constrains consumption and investment. And third, shortages of equipment, materials andlabour in some sectors continue to hamper the production of manufactured goods, delay constructionJump to the transcript of the questions and answerspress release11/23/23, 4:09 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220203~ca7001dec0.en.html 2/12and hold back the recovery in parts of the services sector. There are signs that these bottlenecks maybe starting to ease, but they will still persist for some time.Looking beyond the near term, growth should rebound strongly over the course of 2022, driven byrobust domestic demand. As the labour market is improving further, with more people having jobs andfewer in job retention schemes, households should enjoy higher income and spend more. The globalrecovery and the ongoing fiscal and monetary policy support also contribute to this positive outlook.Targeted and productivity-enhancing fiscal measures and structural reforms, attuned to the conditionsin different euro area countries, remain key to complement our monetary policy effectively.InflationInflation increased to 5.1 per cent in January, from 5.0 per cent in December 2021. It is likely to remainhigh in the near term. Energy prices continue to be the main reason for the elevated rate of inflation.Their direct impact accounted for over half of headline inflation in January and energy costs are alsopushing up prices across many sectors. Food prices have also increased, owing to seasonal factors,elevated transportation costs and the higher price of fertilisers. In addition, price rises have becomemore widespread, with the prices of a large number of goods and services having increased markedly.Most measures of underlying inflation have risen over recent months, although the role of temporarypandemic factors means that the persistence of these increases remains uncertain. Market-basedindicators suggest a moderation in energy price dynamics in the course of 2022 and price pressuresstemming from global supply bottlenecks should also subside.Labour market conditions are improving further, although wage growth remains muted overall. Overtime, the return of the economy to full capacity should support faster growth in wages. Market-basedmeasures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained broadly stable at rates just below twoper cent since our last monetary policy meeting. The latest survey-based measures stand at aroundtwo per cent. These factors will also contribute further to underlying inflation and will help headlineinflation to settle durably at our two per cent target.Risk assessmentWe continue to see the risks to the economic outlook as broadly balanced over the medium term. Theeconomy could perform more strongly than expected if households become more confident and saveless than expected. By contrast, although uncertainties related to the pandemic have abatedsomewhat, geopolitical tensions have increased. Furthermore, persistently high costs of energy couldexert a stronger than expected drag on consumption and investment. The pace at which supplybottlenecks are resolved is a further risk to the outlook for growth and inflation. Compared with ourexpectations in December, risks to the inflation outlook are tilted to the upside, particularly in the nearterm. If price pressures feed through into higher than anticipated wage rises or the economy returnsmore quickly to full capacity, inflation could turn out to be higher.Financial and monetary conditionsMarket interest rates have increased since our December meeting. However, bank funding costs haveso far remained contained. Bank lending rates for firms and households continue to stand at11/23/23, 4:09 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220203~ca7001dec0.en.html 3/12historically low levels and financing conditions for the economy remain favourable. Lending to firmshas picked up, supported by both short and longer-term loans. Robust demand for mortgages issustaining lending to households. Banks are now as profitable as they were before the pandemic andtheir balance sheets remain solid.According to our latest Bank Lending Survey, loan demand by firms increased strongly in the lastquarter of 2021. This was driven by both higher working capital needs, stemming from supplybottlenecks, and increased financing of longer-term investment. In addition, banks continue to hold anoverall benign view of credit risks, mainly because of their positive assessment of the economicoutlook.ConclusionSumming up, the euro area economy continues to recover, but growth is expected to remain subduedin the first quarter. While the outlook for inflation is uncertain, inflation is likely to remain elevated forlonger than previously expected, but to decline in the course of this year. We will remain attentive tothe incoming data and carefully assess the implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. Westand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its twoper cent target over the medium term.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *My first one would be: In light of that record inflation reading seen in January for the eurozone,how did the discussion go in the Governing Council? Are there more frictions now, and is thecamp of those who are calling for action getting louder?The second one is on the market pricing in two rate hikes for 2022. You have been saying that arate hike this year is highly unlikely. What are you saying now? Are you sticking to \u201chighlyunlikely,\u201d or have you moved on?Thank you very much for these two very pertinent questions. Concerning inflation: with the upsidesurprise that we have seen first in December, second in January, I can tell you that there wasunanimous concern around the table of the Governing Council about inflation numbers and obviouslythe impact this has on the near term and the impact this has on our compatriots in Europe. We knowthat the burden is first and foremost borne by those who are most vulnerable, most exposed and whoface the day-to-day hardship of having to put up with higher prices. I can assure you that that concernwas across the board and around the table in equal numbers.We had a very thorough and in-depth discussion about inflation precisely and were focussing on thelatest information we have, but also the impact that it will have on our medium-term outlook. That isclearly something that will be examined in more depth at the time of our March Governing Councilmeeting, when we produce more projections \u2013 which we have not on this occasion \u2013 when we canharness all the latest data that we have, where we can also have more information about the jobmarkets, about wages and where we can really analyse in depth what the impact is on our medium-term projections. We are all driven by the same mandate, which is price stability. We are all concernedto take the right steps at the right time, and I think there was also a concern and a determination11/23/23, 4:09 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220203~ca7001dec0.en.html 4/12around the table not to rush into a decision unless we had a proper and thorough assessment basedon data and the analytical work that will take place in the next few weeks. That's on your first pointconcerning the inflation numbers.On the other question of the rate hikes: you know, I never make pledges without conditionalities and itis even more important at the moment to be very attentive to that. As I said, we will assess verycarefully, we will be data dependent, we will do that work in March. I think it will take us into theanalysis of what are the drivers behind inflation in the short term, what are the drivers behind inflationin the medium term, and how the whole outlook and medium-term projections look like. Let's not forgetthat we will continue doing so on the basis of our forward guidance, that we will continue to observethe sequence that we have agreed, and that we will be gradual in any determination that we make atthe right time on the basis of data.A couple of hours ago, President Lagarde, the Bank of England increased its rate by 0.25%.Four of the nine members of the Committee actually wanted more than that, they wanted 0.5%.You're going to tell me of course that different economies mean different decisions. Could youtell me: what is the difference between the 5.4% inflation in the UK compared to the 5.1% in theeurozone? Why is it not the same course of action in the ECB?The other question is about wage growth. What can you tell us about wage growth in theeurozone? Do you see any sign of that? Are you worried about that side of things?It's interesting because your second question is almost the answer to your first question, but I'll goback a little bit into history. The United Kingdom has had a history of much higher inflation than whatwe have had in the euro area; that's point number one. The critical difference now between ourrespective economies, the critical one \u2013 there are many other ones \u2013 but the critical one has to do withthe labour market, where clearly there is a lot of pressure on wages, where there is scarcity of workersfor jobs that are available, and where - I don't want to take a political stance, but I think that there wasa lot of non-UK labour force that eventually had to leave the United Kingdom which has not beentotally replaced, and where the shortage of workers is actually having a bearing on the forces of thelabour market in the UK. So that's really in essence what is causing the significant difference betweenthe two.On the wage front: what we are seeing and that we can really celebrate is that the euro area is at thelowest unemployment number it has ever been. 7% unemployment is a record number. The secondaspect of that labour market is that our participation of employees in the labour market is back to thelevel where it was pre-COVID. So on those two accounts we have good news to celebrate. What weare not yet seeing is a significant movement in terms of wage increases. We are not seeing a lot eitherin relation to wage negotiations. That normally should be the next step that we see, with lowerunemployment, more people leaving the furlough schemes under which they were operating, and theoutput gap closing gradually and the economy returning to full capacity. We should see movement,and we are not seeing a lot of it yet. Now, of course a lot of the information that we are gettingstatistically is backward-looking, but we are also very attentive to what is happening and what is likelyto happen.That is actually taken into account to a certain extent in our projection numbers, but clearly what willhappen in the next few weeks and what we can see, both for our March meeting and then later on our", "11": "11/23/23, 3:50 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230202~4313651089.en.html 1/12MONET ARY POLICY  STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 2 February 2023Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.We would like to begin by congratulating Croatia on joining the euro area on 1 January 2023. We alsowarmly welcome Boris Vuj\u010di\u0107, the Governor of Hrvatska narodna banka, to the Governing Council. Wewill now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting.The Governing Council will stay the course in raising interest rates significantly at a steady pace and inkeeping them at levels that are sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to our two percent medium-term target. Accordingly, the Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECBinterest rates by 50 basis points and we expect to raise them further. In view of the underlying inflationpressures, we intend to raise interest rates by another 50 basis points at our next monetary policymeeting in March and we will then evaluate the subsequent path of our monetary policy. Keepinginterest rates at restrictive levels will over time reduce inflation by dampening demand and will alsoguard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. In any event, our futurepolicy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach.The Governing Council today also decided on the modalities for reducing the Eurosystem\u2019s holdings ofsecurities under the asset purchase programme (APP). As communicated in December, the APPportfolio will decline by \u20ac15 billion per month on average from the beginning of March until the end ofJune 2023, and the subsequent pace of portfolio reduction will be determined over time. Partialreinvestments will be conducted broadly in line with current practice. In particular, the remainingreinvestment amounts will be allocated proportionally to the share of redemptions across eachconstituent programme of the APP and, under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), to theshare of redemptions of each jurisdiction and across national and supranational issuers. For ourcorporate bond purchases, the remaining reinvestments will be tilted more strongly towards issuerswith a better climate performance. Without prejudice to our price stability objective, this approach willsupport the gradual decarbonisation of the Eurosystem\u2019s corporate bond holdings, in line with thegoals of the Paris Agreement.The decisions taken today are set out in a  available on our website. The detailedmodalities for reducing the APP holdings are described in a separate  to be published at15:45 CET.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explainour assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Jump to the transcript of the questions and answerspress releasepress release11/23/23, 3:50 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230202~4313651089.en.html 2/12Economic activityAccording to Eurostat\u2019s preliminary flash estimate, the euro area economy grew by 0.1 per cent in thefourth quarter of 2022. While above the December Eurosystem staff projections, this outcome meansthat economic activity has slowed markedly since mid-2022 and we expect it to stay weak in the nearterm. Subdued global activity and high geopolitical uncertainty, especially owing to Russia\u2019s unjustifiedwar against Ukraine and its people, continue to act as headwinds to euro area growth. Together withhigh inflation and tighter financing conditions, these headwinds dampen spending and production,especially in the manufacturing sector.However, supply bottlenecks are gradually easing, the supply of gas has become more secure, firmsare still working off large order backlogs and confidence is improving. Moreover, output in the servicessector has been holding up, supported by continuing reopening effects and stronger demand forleisure activities. Rising wages and the recent decline in energy price inflation are also set to ease theloss of purchasing power that many people have experienced owing to high inflation. This, in turn, willsupport consumption. Overall, the economy has proved more resilient than expected and shouldrecover over the coming quarters.The unemployment rate remained at its historical low of 6.6 per cent in December 2022. However, therate at which jobs are being created may slow and unemployment could rise over the coming quarters.Government support measures to shield the economy from the impact of high energy prices should betemporary, targeted and tailored to preserving incentives to consume less energy. In particular, as theenergy crisis becomes less acute, it is important to now start rolling these measures back promptly inline with the fall in energy prices and in a concerted manner. Any such measures falling short of theseprinciples are likely to drive up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a strongermonetary policy response. Moreover, in line with the EU\u2019s economic governance framework, fiscalpolicies should be oriented towards making our economy more productive and gradually bringing downhigh public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area\u2019s supply capacity, especially in the energy sector,can help reduce price pressures in the medium term. To that end, governments should swiftlyimplement their investment and structural reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme.The reform of the EU\u2019s economic governance framework should be concluded rapidly.InflationAccording to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, which has been calculated using Eurostat estimates forGermany, inflation was 8.5 per cent in January. This would be 0.7 percentage points lower than theDecember figure, with the decline owing mainly to a renewed sharp drop in energy prices. Market-based indicators suggest that energy prices over the coming years will be significantly lower thanexpected at the time of our last meeting. Food price inflation edged higher to 14.1 per cent, as the pastsurge in the cost of energy and of other inputs for food production is still feeding through to consumerprices.Price pressures remain strong, partly because high energy costs are spreading throughout theeconomy. Inflation excluding energy and food remained at 5.2 per cent in January, with inflation fornon-energy industrial goods rising to 6.9 per cent and services inflation declining to 4.2 per cent. Otherindicators of underlying inflation are also still high. Government measures to compensate households11/23/23, 3:50 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230202~4313651089.en.html 3/12for high energy prices will dampen inflation in 2023 but are expected to raise inflation once they expire.At the same time, the scale of some of these measures depends on the evolution of energy prices andtheir expected contribution to inflation is particularly uncertain.Although supply bottlenecks are gradually easing, their delayed effects are still pushing up goods priceinflation. The same holds true for the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions: while weakening, theeffect of pent-up demand is still driving up prices, especially in the services sector.Wages are growing faster, supported by robust labour markets, with some catch-up to high inflationbecoming the main theme in wage negotiations. At the same time, recent data on wage dynamicshave been in line with the December Eurosystem staff projections. Most measures of longer-terminflation expectations currently stand at around two per cent, but these warrant continued monitoring.Risk assessmentThe risks to the outlook for economic growth have become more balanced. Russia\u2019s unjustified waragainst Ukraine and its people continues to be a significant downside risk to the economy and couldagain push up the costs of energy and food. There could also be an additional drag on euro areagrowth if the world economy weakened more sharply than we expect. Moreover, the recovery wouldface obstacles if the pandemic were to re-intensify and cause renewed supply disruptions. However,the energy shock could fade away faster than anticipated and euro area companies could adapt morequickly to the challenging international environment. This would support higher growth than currentlyexpected.The risks to the inflation outlook have also become more balanced, especially in the near term. On theupside, existing pipeline pressures could still send retail prices higher in the near term. Moreover, astronger than expected economic rebound in China could give a fresh boost to commodity prices andforeign demand. Domestic factors such as a persistent rise in inflation expectations above our target orhigher than anticipated wage rises could drive inflation higher, also over the medium term. On thedownside, the recent fall in energy prices, if it persists, may slow inflation more rapidly than expected.This downward pressure in the energy component could then also translate into weaker dynamics forunderlying inflation. A further weakening of demand would also contribute to lower price pressuresthan currently anticipated, especially over the medium term.Financial and monetary conditionsAs we tighten monetary policy, market interest rates are rising further and credit to the private sector isbecoming more expensive. Bank lending to firms has decelerated sharply over recent months. Thispartly stems from lower financing needs for inventories. But it also reflects weakening demand forloans to finance business investment, in the context of a steep upward move in bank lending rates anda considerable tightening in credit standards, which is also visible in our most recent bank lendingsurvey. Household borrowing has continued to weaken as well, reflecting rising lending rates, tightercredit standards and a sharp fall in the demand for mortgages. As loan creation decelerates, moneygrowth is also slowing rapidly, with a marked decline in its most liquid components, including overnightdeposits, only partially compensated by a shift to term deposits.11/23/23, 3:50 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230202~4313651089.en.html 4/12ConclusionSumming up, the Governing Council will stay the course in raising interest rates significantly at asteady pace and in keeping them at levels that are sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return ofinflation to our two per cent medium-term target. Accordingly, we today decided to raise the three keyECB interest rates by 50 basis points and we expect to raise them further. In view of the underlyinginflation pressures, we intend to raise interest rates by another 50 basis points at our next monetarypolicy meeting in March and we will then evaluate the subsequent path of our monetary policy.Keeping interest rates at restrictive levels will over time reduce inflation by dampening demand and willalso guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. Moreover, from thebeginning of March 2023, the APP portfolio will decline at a measured and predictable pace, as theEurosystem will not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities.Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and determined meeting bymeeting. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflationreturns to our medium-term target.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about the flavour of the debate that precededtoday\u2019s decision to raise interest rates by 50 basis points in March? I\u2019m interested in knowingwhether there were any calls to commit for longer, potentially flag a less aggressive stance, orsay nothing at all, given that you also say that your decisions are data-dependent. That wouldbe my first question.The second one, I\u2019m interested, when you say the subsequent policy path will be decided inMarch, are we just talking about the pace of rate increases, or could one potential conclusionalso be that you have already reached the peak in interest rates at that time?Those are really good questions to try to explain our decision. I would just remind you that our decisionis not the decision for March. We\u2019re taking a decision as of now, which is to raise all three interest ratesby 50 basis points. I would characterise our good discussions with an enlarged Governing Council,given that we are now 26 around the table, I would characterise them as marked by the sign ofcontinuity and consistency. I know that I have repeated that in the course of the monetary policystatement, and I have said it before, but the expression, \u2018We shall stay the course\u2019, or \u2018the GoverningCouncil will stay the course\u2019, is a good way to express that double principle of continuity andconsistency. Continuity, because we were very clear in December that in all reasonable scenariossignificant rate increases would be needed. Would be needed for what? To bring inflation back to the2% medium-term objective that we have in a timely manner.We also made it clear that this would require rates to rise to sufficiently restrictive levels, and that rateincreases would happen at a steady pace. So we are making that decision in that continuity that I havetried to explain. Steady pace: we increased rates by 50 basis points in December, we increased ratesby 50 basis points in early February, and we intend \u2013 which is a strong word; it\u2019s not an absolute,irrevocable, unconditional commitment, but it\u2019s a strong word \u2013 we intend to raise by 50 basis points,and that is what was meant in December by this steady pace reference that you find, yet again, in the", "12": "11/23/23, 4:07 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180125.en.html 1/13PRESS CONFERENCEMario Draghi, President of the ECB,V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, Vice-Presidentof the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 25 January 2018Ladies and gentlemen, first of all let me wish you a Happy New Year. The Vice-President and I arevery pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019smeeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President,Mr Dombrovskis.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interestrates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended periodof time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases.Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that our net asset purchases, atthe new monthly pace of \u20ac30 billion, are intended to run until the end of September 2018, or beyond, ifnecessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path ofinflation consistent with its inflation aim. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financialconditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path ofinflation, we stand ready to increase the asset purchase programme (APP) in terms of size and/orduration. The Eurosystem will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchasedunder the APP for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any casefor as long as necessary. This will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to anappropriate monetary policy stance.Incoming information confirms a robust pace of economic expansion, which accelerated more thanexpected in the second half of 2017. The strong cyclical momentum, the ongoing reduction ofeconomic slack and increasing capacity utilisation strengthen further our confidence that inflation willconverge towards our inflation aim of below, but close to, 2%. At the same time, domestic pricepressures remain muted overall and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.Against this background, the recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertaintywhich requires monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for pricestability. Overall, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflationpressures to continue to build up and support headline inflation developments over the medium term.This continued monetary support is provided by the net asset purchases, by the sizeable stock ofacquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and by our forward guidance on interest rates.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDPincreased by 0.7%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2017, following similar growth in thesecond quarter. The latest economic data and survey results indicate continued strong and broad-based growth momentum at the turn of the year. Our monetary policy measures, which have facilitatedthe deleveraging process, continue to underpin domestic demand. Private consumption is supportedby rising employment, which is also benefiting from past labour market reforms, and by growingJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:07 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180125.en.html 2/13household wealth. Business investment continues to strengthen on the back of very favourablefinancing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. Housing investment has improvedfurther over recent quarters. In addition, the broad-based global expansion is providing impetus to euroarea exports.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are assessed as broadly balanced. On the onehand, the prevailing strong cyclical momentum could lead to further positive growth surprises in thenear term. On the other hand, downside risks continue to relate primarily to global factors, includingdevelopments in foreign exchange markets.Euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.4% in December 2017, down from 1.5% in November. Thisreflected mainly developments in energy prices. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures pricesfor oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around current levels in the coming months.For their part, measures of underlying inflation remain subdued \u2013 in part owing to special factors \u2013 andhave yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. Yet, looking forward, they areexpected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, thecontinuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wagegrowth.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with anannual rate of growth of 4.9% in November 2017, after 5.0% in October, reflecting the impact of theECB\u2019s monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits.Accordingly, the narrow monetary aggregate M1 continued to be the main contributor to broad moneygrowth, expanding at an annual rate of 9.1% in November, after 9.4% in October.The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 isproceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 3.1% inNovember 2017, after 2.9% in October, while the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at2.8% in November, compared with 2.7% in October. The euro area bank lending survey for the fourthquarter of 2017 indicates that loan growth continues to be supported by increasing demand and afurther easing in overall lending conditions.The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues tosignificantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing \u2012 notably forsmall and medium-sized enterprises \u2012 and credit flows across the euro area.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed the need for an ample degree of monetary accommodation to secure asustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contributedecisively to strengthening the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. Theimplementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up toincrease resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growthpotential. Regarding fiscal policies, the increasingly solid and broad-based expansion strengthensthe case for rebuilding fiscal buffers. This is particularly important in countries where government debtremains high. All countries would benefit from intensifying efforts towards achieving a more growth-11/23/23, 4:07 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180125.en.html 3/13friendly composition of public finances. A full, transparent and consistent implementation of theStability and Growth Pact and of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure over time and acrosscountries remains essential to increase the resilience of the euro area economy. StrengtheningEconomic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoingdiscussions on completing the banking union and the capital markets union, and on further deepeningEconomic and Monetary Union.We are now at your disposal for questions.* * *I have a question concerning the asset purchase programme. When you launched theprogramme you decided to keep the purchases as strictly according to the ECB capital key. Butnow it turns out that you are increasingly deviating from this as a new survey or a newcalculation from the Centre of European Economic Research (ZEW) has claimed. Why is thisso? Is this affecting the neutrality of the purchases?Draghi: It's not so, it doesn't affect the neutrality of the purchases \u2013 and I'll tell you the reasons whyyou observe these deviations. The ECB doesn't favour certain countries over others in its PSPPpurchase programme implementation. As you know, purchases are guided by the ECB's capital key,which takes into account GDP and population. Now, focusing excessively on any particular purchaseperiod, for example on 2017 only, could result and yield wrong interpretations. The overall stock ofEurosystem PSPP holdings is the relevant metric for any assessment of the programme and not therecent purchase flows. Just to give you an example: currently the Eurosystem holdings of Germansecurities are above the German share of the ECB capital key. This equates to the Eurosystemholdings\u20ac18 billion more in German securities than what is implied by the [German] ECB capital keyshare.Of course the largest deviation from the ECB's capital key is Greece due to their ineligibility. In additionEurosystem holdings of Portuguese securities are 1.8%, which is 27% below, compared to [thePortuguese] share of ECB capital key, which is 2.48%. These flows can differ as the design of theprogramme is flexible and the distribution of actual purchases often deviates from the ECB capital key.For example if we fall short of purchase targets in one jurisdiction for market liquidity reasons, then theshortfall is made up in others. This has happened since the beginning of the programme so it's nothingnew. Moreover, this is particularly relevant for the process of reinvestments, where the amounts to bereinvested are sometimes distributed over three months. This can lead to temporary changes in therelative net purchase shares. In certain countries, implied purchase shares are above the capital keypercentages as we don't buy the required bonds in other jurisdictions due to various programmeconstraints, for example eligibility criteria, issue and issuer limits, market liquidity.So, all these adjustments reflect the programme's inbuilt flexibility and the commitment to a continuedsmooth implementation of the programme. Our general approach has never been changed. Ourpurchase shares are guided by ECB capital key as opposed to market cap[italisation], which is ourreference for all other purchase programmes. Moreover comparing and finally individual jurisdictionsnet issuance and the actual purchases in the respective countries suggests, all other things beingequal, that the downward impact of the programme on yields for countries such as Germany should behigher than on other countries.11/23/23, 4:07 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180125.en.html 4/13My first question would be about your comment on the currency volatility. You said that itrepresents a source of uncertainty and also with regards to the implication for inflation. Now,you also talk about your strength and conviction about that inflation will turn to the targets. SoI'd like to ask how much euro is already a problem in that respect, or what will have to happenfor the exchange rate to become a problem in respect to inflation target.My second question would be about your discussion on reviewing the forward guidance. Theaccount of the meeting from December mentions that there was a mention of a need to revisitthe guidance early in the year. My question is, has this discussion already started? If so, whatwas the basic summary of that discussion?Draghi: Let me answer the second question first. Let me get the record straight because severalmembers of the Governing Council were surprised by the reading of the accounts \u2013 by the effects thatthe reading of the accounts had on the markets and they asked me to clarify this. First of all, there isno difference between the accounts and what I said in the press conference. What I was asked was,did you discuss cutting the link in your guidance between the APP \u2013 the asset purchase programme \u2013and inflation and what is your view on that question? I responded; we didn't discuss cutting the link.Actually in a sense, I went beyond what was in the accounts in my press conference because I said asa consequence of this continued expansion, also the component coming from the forward guidance ofinterest rates will gain further and further importance. This is a natural process led by the recovery. Inthis sense our monetary policy accompanies the recovery, as I had chance to say in a speech sometime ago \u2013 but we haven't discussed the link.Now, the excerpt of the accounts says: looking ahead the view was widely shared among members.So the Governing Council's communication will need to evolve gradually without a change insequencing. The only discussion that took place was about the need to have a discussion. You see,my press conference went in \u2013 started going to the substance. But the actual discussion in theGoverning Council was only scheduling the discussion which was to take place in the early part of thisyear. Well, now, that's important to clarify.So discussion hasn't really started. We really went through the events since October to now and tryingto basically assess whether something has changed. There hasn't been much of a change other thana continuing strengthening of the economy more \u2013 to some extent even more \u2013 than expected. Now,we have as I said downside risks relating primarily to geopolitical and especially foreign exchangemarkets. By and large, the risks to growth are balanced. Now, can we declare victory? The answer isno, not yet. Price pressures are muted, underlying inflation still doesn't show signs of any convincingupward movements. Price pressures along the pricing chain remain broadly stable and subdued.Recent data on wage growth confirms some lift-off] from its lows of 2016 second quarter, but it's a lift-off so far mostly due to wage drift, not negotiated wages. We have to look better and see whether thispicks up and is confirmed.The survey measures of long-term inflation expectations remain broadly unchanged, while market-based measures have increased to 1.76%/78%. By and large there isn't much of a change, which ledus to simply restate the policy, as I've just said in the introductory statement, where basically wecontinue the monthly pace of \u20ac30 billion extended to run until the end of September 2018 and so on.There is no need for me to read it again, I guess.

We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council, whichwas also attended by the Commission Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interestrates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through thesummer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustainedconvergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, theprincipal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for anextended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in anycase for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree ofmonetary accommodation.The incoming information has continued to be weaker than expected on account of softer externaldemand and some country and sector-specific factors. The persistence of uncertainties in particularrelating to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism is weighing on economic sentiment. Atthe same time, supportive financing conditions, favourable labour market dynamics and rising wagegrowth continue to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures. Thissupports our confidence in the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below,but close to, 2% over the medium term. Significant monetary policy stimulus remains essential tosupport the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over themedium term. This will be provided by our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforcedby the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets. In any event, the Governing Councilstands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to movetowards the Governing Council\u2019s inflation aim in a sustained manner.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro areareal GDP increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2018, following growth of 0.4%in the previous two quarters. Incoming data have continued to be weaker than expected as a result ofa slowdown in external demand compounded by some country and sector-specific factors. While theimpact of some of these factors is expected to fade, the near-term growth momentum is likely to beweaker than previously anticipated. Looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to besupported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, lowerenergy prices, and the ongoing \u2013 albeit somewhat slower \u2013 expansion in global activity.Jump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:10 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190124~cd3821f8f5.en.html 2/12The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside on account of thepersistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism,vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility.Euro area annual HICP inflation declined to 1.6% in December 2018, from 1.9% in November,reflecting mainly lower energy price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headlineinflation is likely to decline further over the coming months. Measures of underlying inflation remaingenerally muted, but labour cost pressures are continuing to strengthen and broaden amid high levelsof capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected toincrease over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economicexpansion and rising wage growth.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth moderated to 3.7% in November 2018,after 3.9% in October. M3 growth continues to be backed by bank credit creation. The narrowmonetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth.The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 4.0% in November 2018, after3.9% in October, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained broadly unchanged at3.3%. The euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2018 suggests that overall banklending conditions remained favourable, following an extended period of net easing, and demand forbank credit continued to rise, thereby underpinning loan growth.The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues tosignificantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing \u2013 in particularfor small and medium-sized enterprises \u2013 and credit flows across the euro area.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary forthe continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over themedium term.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contributemore decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. Theimplementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up toincrease resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growthpotential. Regarding fiscal policies, the Governing Council reiterates the need for rebuilding fiscalbuffers. This is particularly important in countries where government debt is high and for which fulladherence to the Stability and Growth Pact is critical for safeguarding sound fiscal positions. Likewise,the transparent and consistent implementation of the EU\u2019s fiscal and economic governance frameworkover time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy.Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Councilwelcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the bankingunion and the capital markets union.We are now at your disposal for questions.* * *11/23/23, 4:10 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190124~cd3821f8f5.en.html 3/12My first question relates to your assessment, that risks have moved to the downside. What sortof implication will that have for your policy and especially for your forward guidance?My second question, you told us in December that at some point you asked committees to startwork on TLTROs. Have they already been put to work? Have they been tasked with looking intoTLTROs?Draghi: Well, today we didn't discuss the implications. Today's meeting was essentially devoted to anassessment. Where are we? Why are we here? How long will this slowdown last? Is the slowdowngoing to worsen or stay as a shallow lower path? These were the questions that were asked.On the second question, several speakers actually raised this issue but no decision was takenbecause we didn't discuss policies this time. We only were focused on the assessment. Quite clearly,the assessment will have implications about policy but we didn't discuss them.Given that data have disappointed on the downside, fairly consistently since your last meetingwhat gives you confidence that your economic assessment is actually correct and there isgoing to be a rebound?My second question is quite similar, which is about core inflation, you predicted a vigorous risein core inflation towards the end of last year. It didn't happen and it's still not happening. Againwhat gives you confidence that your assessment is correct?Draghi: It's basically one question, really. You see, underlying inflation has been muted, has beenmoving sideways, it's higher than the low levels reached about a year ago and \u2026 On what ourconfidence is based, it is based on the continuation of the economic expansion. It is based on thestrong labour market performance, though it's slowing down. It's based on the encouraging pick-up inwages, nominal wage growth has gone up especially of course in the core countries and especially inGermany. Both compensation per employee and negotiated wages show a pick-up, consistentsignificant pick-up. So the issue is we see all these components moving in the right direction and sothe question is why haven't they passed through? Why aren't they being passed through into higherprices? What we are observing is that there is a profit squeeze so it's a matter of time that of coursethis pass-through will happen first in the parts of the eurozone where the labour market is stronger,unemployment is lower, especially in some countries where basically there is full employment. Thengradually it will expand to other countries. That is what really gives us [confidence]. Then of course thefinancing conditions and our monetary policy that remains fully accommodative, strengthens ourconfidence in this process.You were saying that this meeting was more or less for the assessment of where we standwhen it comes to the economy and how long the potential downturn will last or how long will itlast in your view?Another question is whether you're happy with what the market is pricing in, in terms ofinterest rate hike because now the market is only pricing in the first hike in 2020. You are stillguiding us more or less for the full period of this year, so what's your view here? Is the marketright? Or do you need to upgrade or update us on your forward guidance?]Draghi: Since you're all asking, let me give you a summary of the meeting now. First of all, what youcare most, were we unanimous? Okay, we were unanimous about acknowledging the weaker11/23/23, 4:10 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190124~cd3821f8f5.en.html 4/12momentum and changing the balance of risk for growth. We're all in agreement on that and we wereunanimous in assessing the factors that have caused the slowdown, namely first and foremost there isan increase in general uncertainty. This increase in general uncertainty has been produced by thethreats of protectionism, doubts \u2013 actually extensive doubts \u2013 about the multilateral rules that haveunderpinned our growth since the Second World War. The protracted and unclear outcome, theprotracted negotiations and their unclear outcome yet about Brexit and of course the implications thatthis might have, I have said many times that if you compare the potential disruption coming from Brexitfor the aggregate of the euro area, well, just looking at aggregate numbers it doesn't seem to be anextensive disruption. But we have to take into account things like value chains and we have also totake into account that some countries are more exposed, of course, to events in the Brexit case. Wefollow that.But that just is a sign of a contribution to the increase in general uncertainty and then of course wehave the political developments in some countries in the eurozone. This is one set of factors. There isanother set of factors that is specific; factors that are specific to certain countries and this has to dowith the slowdown in China and the waning effects of fiscal package in the United States and the carindustry in Germany. All this, it's a pretty long list of factors so the issue is now, and that's again therewas unanimity, in saying that the key aspect to assess is the persistence of the general uncertainty asbeing produced by these factors. Certainly if all this were to persist, we should expect a longer weakmomentum beyond the near term.Then finally there was also quite, I would say, unanimity about assessing the likelihood of a recessionas being low. Now, again I don't want to give numbers here but some of them are very low, others areon the average since the last 60 years or 50 years. So in any event pretty low \u2013 of course again in anarea like the eurozone, these estimates ought to be taken with some caution because if you have aserious recession in one part of the eurozone, that can spread to other parts. Basically, it wasunanimity about assessing this likelihood as low.Also why was it low? Because financing conditions continued to be basically very favourable.Developments in the labour market continued to be positive. Nominal wage growth continues to besignificant and of course the lower energy prices support real disposable income for households. Alsothere is another factor to keep in mind that makes the present situation different from the situation wehad at the beginning of the great financial crisis. This time banks' balance sheets are much strongerthan they were before the crisis. Now, of course we have local episodes of weakness but by and large,the banking sector is much stronger than it was at the beginning of the crisis. So the conditions for acontinuation of credit to the economy are in place.Then the discussion focused on persistence and there were two viewpoints. For some, China, theslowdown in China won't last long because we have confidence \u2013 and we do have confidence \u2013 in thegovernment's measures. Everything we know says that the government is actually taking strongmeasures to address the slowdown. The trade disputes will wane. In the end, the Brexit thing will notaffect the EU economy that much, but especially there was one aspect of the discussion is that allthese uncertainties, all these risks are being addressed by the policy response of the authorities inthese countries. The specific episode of the car industry in Germany will soon wash out because thereis going to be a rebound in the sector.", "14": "11/23/23, 3:56 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200123~0bc778277b.en.html 1/12INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 23 January 2020Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interestrates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen theinflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projectionhorizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.We will continue to make net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) at a monthlypace of \u20ac20 billion. We expect them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodativeimpact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates.We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the keyECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditionsand an ample degree of monetary accommodation.Today the Governing Council also decided to launch a review of the ECB\u2019s monetary policy strategy.Further details about the scope and timetable of the review will be published in a press release todayat 15:30 CET.The incoming data since our last meeting are in line with our baseline scenario of ongoing, butmoderate, growth of the euro area economy. In particular, the weakness in the manufacturing sectorremains a drag on euro area growth momentum. However, ongoing, albeit decelerating, employmentgrowth and increasing wages continue to support the resilience of the euro area economy. Whileinflation developments remain subdued overall, there are some signs of a moderate increase inunderlying inflation in line with expectations.The unfolding monetary policy measures are underpinning favourable financing conditions for allsectors of the economy. In particular, easier borrowing conditions for firms and households aresupporting consumer spending and business investment. This will sustain the euro area expansion,the build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the robust convergence of inflation to our medium-term aim.At the same time, in the light of the continued subdued inflation outlook, monetary policy has to remainhighly accommodative for a prolonged period of time to support underlying inflation pressures andheadline inflation developments over the medium term. We will, therefore, closely monitor inflationdevelopments and the impact of the unfolding monetary policy measures on the economy. Our forwardJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 3:56 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200123~0bc778277b.en.html 2/12guidance will ensure that financial conditions adjust in accordance with changes to the inflationoutlook. In any case, the Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, asappropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with itscommitment to symmetry.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro areareal GDP increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2019, following growth of 0.2%in the second quarter. This pattern of moderate growth reflects the ongoing weakness of internationaltrade in an environment of continued global uncertainties, which has particularly affected the euro areamanufacturing sector and has also dampened investment growth. At the same time, the services andconstruction sectors remain more resilient, despite some moderation in the latter half of 2019.Incoming economic data and survey information point to some stabilisation in euro area growthdynamics, with near-term growth expected to be similar to rates observed in previous quarters.Looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financingconditions, further employment gains in conjunction with rising wages, the mildly expansionary euroarea fiscal stance and the ongoing \u2013 albeit somewhat slower \u2013 growth in global activity.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook, related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionismand vulnerabilities in emerging markets, remain tilted to the downside, but have become lesspronounced as some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade is receding.Euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 1.3% in December 2019, from 1.0% in November,reflecting mainly higher energy price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headlineinflation is likely to hover around current levels in the coming months. While indicators of inflationexpectations remain at low levels, recently they have either stabilised or ticked up slightly. Measures ofunderlying inflation have remained generally muted, although there are further indications of amoderate increase in line with previous expectations. While labour cost pressures have strengthenedamid tighter labour markets, the weaker growth momentum is delaying their pass-through to inflation.Over the medium term, inflation is expected to increase, supported by our monetary policy measures,the ongoing economic expansion and solid wage growth.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth stood at 5.6% in November 2019,broadly unchanged since August. Sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank creditcreation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3 relative to other financialinstruments. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continues to be the main contributor to broad moneygrowth on the components side.The growth of loans to firms and households remained solid, benefiting from the ongoing supportprovided by our accommodative monetary policy stance, which is reflected in very low bank lendingrates. While the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged from October, at3.5% in November, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations moderated to 3.4% inNovember, from 3.8% in October, likely reflecting some lagged reaction to the past weakening in theeconomy. These developments are also visible in the results of the euro area bank lending survey forthe fourth quarter of 2019, which indicate weakening demand for loans to firms, while demand forloans to households for house purchase continued to increase. However, credit standards for bothloans to firms and loans to households for house purchase remained broadly unchanged, pointing to11/23/23, 3:56 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200123~0bc778277b.en.html 3/12still favourable credit supply conditions. Overall, our accommodative monetary policy stance will helpto safeguard very favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financingacross all economic sectors and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary forthe continued robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over themedium term.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contributemore decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential, supporting aggregate demand at thecurrent juncture and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural policies in euro areacountries needs to be substantially stepped up to boost euro area productivity and growth potential,reduce structural unemployment and increase resilience. The 2019 country-specific recommendationsshould serve as the relevant signpost.Regarding fiscal policies, the euro area fiscal stance is expected to continue to provide some supportto economic activity. In view of the weak economic outlook, the Governing Council welcomes theEurogroup\u2019s call in December for differentiated fiscal responses and its readiness to coordinate.Governments with fiscal space should be ready to act in an effective and timely manner. In countrieswhere public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balancetargets, which will create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely. All countries shouldintensify their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances.Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the European Union\u2019s fiscal and economicgovernance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience ofthe euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority.The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps tocomplete the banking union and the capital markets union.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *Two questions for you. Firstly, trade seems to be the order of the day or the order of the week.What do you think about the prospects of a potential trade war between the US and the EU?Does that seem more or less likely since the start of the year?Secondly, I'd like to hear your reaction to Sweden ending its experiment with negative interestrates and whether you think that markets are assuming you don't have the potential to cutfurther, and they're signalling that the next rate rise will be upwards rather than downwards.Are they correct in that assumption?President Lagarde: That's three questions in a row. Okay, on the trade front, I think you're quite right insignalling that trade is actually an important element in our considerations and particularly in assessingthe downside risks. I think one critical development since our last meeting in late December has beenthe conclusion of phase one of the negotiations between US and China. That in and of itself has avariety of consequences. It has consequences in relation to uncertainty. It certainly has slightlyreduced, if not vanished, but it also has consequences in terms of international trade at large, and11/23/23, 3:56 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200123~0bc778277b.en.html 4/12indirect consequences for those regions or countries around the world from which trade will bediverted in order to deliver on that phase one. This is something that our teams are looking at verycarefully to assess exactly what will be the impact on the net basis for the euro area.In terms of the trade relationship between the US and the EU, I took some comfort from the meetingthat was concluded a couple of days ago between the President of the European Union Commission,Ursula von der Leyen, with the President of the United States. While we all know that the results ofthose meetings are preliminary, the tone and the determination on both sides to draw positiveconclusions from that meeting and to indicate determination to pursue the negotiations and theapproach to the trade relationships between the EU and the US, I think, is to be taken as a positivesignal. I know that the President of the Commission will be visiting the United States in February. Iwould expect continued work to be ongoing between the parties by then, and hopefully some positivedevelopments out of that February visit. Clearly, we're going to monitor that very carefully and seewhat the signals are with due consideration for the limitation of signals relative to what the outcome offinal negotiations can be.In relation to the setting of rates, particularly by Sweden, I think I'll leave it to the Swedish central bankand to Stefan Ingves to actually indicate on what ground, for what reason there was a determination toactually return, for the moment at least, to a zero interest rate. My understanding of this conclusion isthat there had been a positive outcome of that period of negative interest rates. And drawing from that,given the economic circumstances and the inflation expectations, it was legitimate and their decision toactually return to the zero rate, where they are at the moment. Every region and every country has itsidiosyncrasies and rationale. I think comparisons in that respect are odious, as we all know. Clearly,everybody is going to look at what conclusions are drawn from that monetary policy reversal, if youwill, in Sweden but I wouldn't draw any conclusion as far as our policies are concerned.As I said very clearly I think in the introductory statement, the Governing Council is going to be veryattentive to any and all developments in all directions, both in terms of growth but obviously in terms ofinflation, which is our measurement of price stability, and will take whatever measures are necessary,as appropriate, in order to respond to our imperative to deliver on our mandate of price stability. Thatwas a bit of a long-winded one but you had three questions in one, so it had to be long.President Lagarde, a question about the inflation target. Do you agree with your predecessorthat the inflation target should be viewed as symmetric? I'm also curious about your view onthe suggestion of creating a target band around two per cent.Then a question on the risks: you said that the risks remain tilted to the downside, but less so;was there some discussion about maybe saying that risks are now balanced?President Lagarde: On the inflation target, we have a policy by which we operate. We have a strategythat was defined and that has inspired the policy decisions that were made and that have been madeup until this day. That will continue to inspire the policy decisions that are made until a strategy hasbeen adopted \u2013 which is a while from now but I'm sure you'll have questions about the strategy. In thatrespect, I would just adhere to what that strategy was, what its developments were over the course oftime. I think the point of symmetry is very clearly referred to in the introductory statement. One pressconference after the other, so I would refer you to that. You very gently nudged me into having a viewas to whether there should be a band, as to whether there should be this, that or the other. I'm going to", "15": "11/23/23, 3:52 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210121~e601112a72.en.html 1/12INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 21 January 2021Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council, whichwas also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.The start of vaccination campaigns across the euro area is an important milestone in the resolution ofthe ongoing health crisis. Nonetheless, the pandemic continues to pose serious risks to public healthand to the euro area and global economies. The renewed surge in coronavirus (COVID-19) infectionsand the restrictive and prolonged containment measures imposed in many euro area countries aredisrupting economic activity. Activity in the manufacturing sector continues to hold up well, but servicessector activity is being severely curbed, albeit to a lesser degree than during the first wave of thepandemic in early 2020. Output is likely to have contracted in the fourth quarter of 2020 and theintensification of the pandemic poses some downside risks to the short-term economic outlook.Inflation remains very low in the context of weak demand and significant slack in labour and productmarkets. Overall, the incoming data confirm our previous baseline assessment of a pronounced near-term impact of the pandemic on the economy and a protracted weakness in inflation.In this environment ample monetary stimulus remains essential to preserve favourable financingconditions over the pandemic period for all sectors of the economy. By helping to reduce uncertaintyand bolster confidence, this will encourage consumer spending and business investment,underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability. Meanwhile, uncertaintyremains high, including relating to the dynamics of the pandemic and the speed of vaccinationcampaigns. We will also continue to monitor developments in the exchange rate with regard to theirpossible implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. We continue to stand ready to adjust all ofour instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards our aim in a sustained manner,in line with our commitment to symmetry.Against this background, we decided to reconfirm our very accommodative monetary policy stance.First, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect themto remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to alevel sufficiently close to, but below, 2 per cent within our projection horizon, and such convergencehas been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.Second, we will continue our purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)with a total envelope of \u20ac1,850 billion. We will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until atJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 3:52 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210121~e601112a72.en.html 2/12least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until the Governing Council judges that the coronaviruscrisis phase is over.The purchases under the PEPP will be conducted to preserve favourable financing conditions over thepandemic period. We will purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view topreventing a tightening of financing conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downwardimpact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. In addition, the flexibility of purchases overtime, across asset classes and among jurisdictions will continue to support the smooth transmission ofmonetary policy. If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows thatdo not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not beused in full. Equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financingconditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.We will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under thePEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will bemanaged to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.Third, net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of\u20ac20 billion. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long asnecessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before westart raising the key ECB interest rates.We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the keyECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditionsand an ample degree of monetary accommodation.Finally, we will continue to provide ample liquidity through our refinancing operations. In particular, ourthird series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) remains an attractive source offunding for banks, supporting bank lending to firms and households.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Followinga sharp contraction in the first half of 2020, euro area real GDP rebounded strongly and rose by 12.4per cent, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter, although remaining well below pre-pandemic levels.Incoming economic data, surveys and high-frequency indicators suggest that the resurgence of thepandemic and the associated intensification of containment measures have likely led to a decline inactivity in the fourth quarter of 2020 and are also expected to weigh on activity in the first quarter ofthis year. In sum, this is broadly in line with the latest baseline of the December 2020 macroeconomicprojections.Economic developments continue to be uneven across sectors, with the services sector being moreadversely affected by the new restrictions on social interaction and mobility than the industrial sector.Although fiscal policy measures are continuing to support households and firms, consumers remaincautious in the light of the pandemic and its impact on employment and earnings. Moreover, weakercorporate balance sheets and uncertainty about the economic outlook are still weighing on businessinvestment.11/23/23, 3:52 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210121~e601112a72.en.html 3/12Looking ahead, the roll-out of vaccines, which started in late December, allows for greater confidencein the resolution of the health crisis. However, it will take time until widespread immunity is achieved,and further adverse developments related to the pandemic cannot be ruled out. Over the mediumterm, the recovery of the euro area economy should be supported by favourable financing conditions,an expansionary fiscal stance and a recovery in demand as containment measures are lifted anduncertainty recedes.Overall, the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside but lesspronounced. The news about the prospects for the global economy, the agreement on future EU-UKrelations and the start of vaccination campaigns is encouraging, but the ongoing pandemic and itsimplications for economic and financial conditions continue to be sources of downside risk.Euro area annual inflation remained unchanged at -0.3 per cent in December. On the basis of currentenergy price dynamics, headline inflation is likely to increase in the coming months, also supported bythe end of the temporary VAT reduction in Germany. However, underlying price pressures areexpected to remain subdued owing to weak demand, notably in the tourism and travel-related sectors,as well as to low wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate. Once the impact ofthe pandemic fades, a recovery in demand, supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies,will put upward pressure on inflation over the medium term. Survey-based measures and market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations remain at low levels, although market-basedindicators of inflation expectations have increased slightly.Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of broad money (M3) increased to 11.0 percent in November 2020, from 10.5 per cent in October, reflecting a continued increase in depositholdings. Strong money growth continued to be supported by the ongoing asset purchases by theEurosystem, which remain the largest source of money creation. In the context of a still heightenedpreference for liquidity in the money-holding sector and a low opportunity cost of holding the mostliquid forms of money, the narrow monetary aggregate M1 has remained the main contributor to broadmoney growth.Developments in loans to the private sector were characterised by moderate lending to non-financialcorporations and resilient lending to households. The monthly lending flow to non-financialcorporations remained very modest in November, continuing the pattern observed since the end of thesummer. At the same time, the annual growth rate remained broadly unchanged, at 6.9 per cent, stillreflecting the very strong increase in lending in the first half of the year. The annual growth rate ofloans to households remained broadly stable at 3.1 per cent in November, amid a sizeable positivemonthly flow.The new bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2020 reports a tightening of credit standards onloans to firms. This tightening was mainly driven by heightened risk perceptions among banks, in acontext of continued uncertainty about the economic recovery and concerns about borrowercreditworthiness. Surveyed banks also reported a fall in loan demand from firms in the fourth quarter.The survey also indicated a further increase in net demand from households for loans for housepurchase in the fourth quarter, even though credit standards continued to tighten.Overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments and otherEuropean institutions, remain essential to support bank lending conditions and access to financing, in11/23/23, 3:52 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210121~e601112a72.en.html 4/12particular for those most affected by the pandemic.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary tosupport economic activity and the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to,2 per cent over the medium term.Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of thesharp contraction in the euro area economy. To this end, continued support from national fiscal policiesis warranted given weak demand from firms and households relating to the worsening of the pandemicand the intensification of containment measures. At the same time, fiscal measures taken in responseto the pandemic emergency should, as much as possible, remain targeted and temporary in nature.The three safety nets endorsed by the European Council for workers, businesses and governmentsprovide important funding support.The Governing Council recognises the key role of the Next Generation EU package and stresses theimportance of it becoming operational without delay. It calls on Member States to accelerate theratification process, to finalise their recovery and resilience plans promptly and to deploy the funds forproductive public spending, accompanied by productivity-enhancing structural policies. This wouldallow the Next Generation EU programme to contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniformrecovery and would increase economic resilience and the growth potential of Member States\u2019economies, thereby supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area. Such structuralpolicies are particularly important in addressing long-standing structural and institutional weaknessesand in accelerating the green and digital transitions.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *President Lagarde, I have a question regarding the favourable financing conditions. You\u2019vebeen elaborating on the tightening of financial conditions in Europe, bank lending surveys, sohow concerned are you about that tightening, and if that tightening were to continue, wouldthat mean that the financing conditions are no longer favourable?My second question is on the economy and the renewed lockdowns in major economies in theeuro zone, whether this is affecting your economic outlook at all, because it doesn\u2019t reallyseem to in your text, and also how concerned are you about the creation of zombie companiesin that context?Well, thank you so much, and you actually give me a chance to reverse the order of your questions,because I would like to address the second part of your question, which had to do with the economicoutlook, because I think that it in a way determines what was decided today at our monetary policyGoverning Council. And when, you know, we look at the current economic situation, we are clearlyseeing mixed developments and those mixed developments apply to countries, member states, thathave been affected in different ways and to different degrees by the pandemic.So, if I was to sort of put in two categories the developments that we are seeing, you have the positivedevelopments and the not-so-positive developments, and as part of the positive, I would certainly say,number 1, the fact that the vaccination campaign has now started, now albeit with some difficulty to", "16": "11/23/23, 4:10 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180726.en.html 1/9INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEMario Draghi, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-Presidentof the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 26 July 2018Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interestrates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through thesummer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustainedconvergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we will continue to make net purchases underthe asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of \u20ac30 billion until the end ofSeptember 2018. We anticipate that, after September 2018, subject to incoming data confirming ourmedium-term inflation outlook, we will reduce the monthly pace of the net asset purchases to \u20ac15billion until the end of December 2018 and then end net purchases. We intend to reinvest the principalpayments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after theend of our net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourableliquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.While uncertainties, notably related to the global trade environment, remain prominent, the informationavailable since our last monetary policy meeting indicates that the euro area economy is proceedingalong a solid and broad-based growth path. The underlying strength of the economy confirms ourconfidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim will continue in the period ahead andwill be maintained even after a gradual winding-down of our net asset purchases. Nevertheless,significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of domestic pricepressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. This support will continue to beprovided by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock of acquired assetsand the associated reinvestments, and by our enhanced forward guidance on the key ECB interestrates. In any event, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriateto ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council\u2019s inflation aim in a sustainedmanner.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Quarterlyreal GDP growth moderated to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2018, following growth of 0.7% in theprevious three quarters. This easing reflects a pull-back from the very high levels of growth in 2017and is related mainly to weaker impetus from previously very strong external trade, compounded by anincrease in uncertainty and some temporary and supply-side factors at both the domestic and theglobal level. The latest economic indicators and survey results have stabilised and continue to point toJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:10 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180726.en.html 2/9ongoing solid and broad-based economic growth, in line with the June 2018 Eurosystem staffmacroeconomic projections for the euro area. Our monetary policy measures, which have facilitatedthe deleveraging process, continue to underpin domestic demand. Private consumption is supportedby ongoing employment gains, which, in turn, partly reflect past labour market reforms, and by growinghousehold wealth. Business investment is fostered by the favourable financing conditions, risingcorporate profitability and solid demand. Housing investment remains robust. In addition, the broad-based expansion in global demand is expected to continue, thus providing impetus to euro areaexports.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced.Uncertainties related to global factors, notably the threat of protectionism, remain prominent.Moreover, the risk of persistent heightened financial market volatility continues to warrant monitoring.Euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 2.0% in June 2018, from 1.9% in May, reflecting mainlyhigher energy and food price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates ofheadline inflation are likely to hover around the current level for the remainder of the year. Whilemeasures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows.Domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of capacity utilisation andtightening labour markets. Uncertainty around the inflation outlook is receding. Looking ahead,underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the end of the year and thereafter to increasegradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economicexpansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth increased to 4.4% in June 2018, up from4.0% in May. M3 growth continues to benefit from the impact of the ECB\u2019s monetary policy measuresand the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits. The narrow monetary aggregate M1remained the main contributor to broad money growth.The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 isproceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rose to 4.1% in June 2018,after 3.7% in the previous month, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remainedunchanged at 2.9%. The euro area bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2018 indicates thatloan growth continues to be supported by easing credit standards and increasing demand across allloan categories.The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues tosignificantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing \u2013 in particularfor small and medium-sized enterprises \u2013 and credit flows across the euro area.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary forthe continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over themedium term.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contributemore decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. Theimplementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to11/23/23, 4:10 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180726.en.html 3/9increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growthpotential. Regarding fiscal policies, the ongoing broad-based expansion calls for rebuilding fiscalbuffers. This is particularly important in countries where government debt remains high. All countrieswould benefit from intensifying efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of publicfinances. A full, transparent and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of themacroeconomic imbalance procedure over time and across countries remains essential to increasethe resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Unionremains a priority. The Governing Council urges specific and decisive steps to complete the bankingunion and the capital markets union.We are now at your disposal for questions.* * *In the assessment you just presented, did you have a chance to review the agreement struckbetween the EU Commission President and the US President overnight with regard to trade? Isthis assessment only regarding sentiment regarding protectionism? Or are you seeing anactual impact on growth already materialising?The second question is a 'did you discuss' question: did you discuss your reinvestment policytoday and if so, could you give us any kind of colour about this discussion? What decisionsneed to be made and when should we expect a decision on reinvestment policy?Draghi: On the first question really, we basically took note of that. It's too early to assess the actualcontent. I understand that this afternoon the Commission is having a meeting exactly for this reason.We took note of this meeting and if one can say something that's general, it's a good sign because itshows that there is a willingness to discuss trade issues in a multilateral framework again. It would bedifficult for us to go beyond that because we really don't know the substance of it.On the second question, no, we didn't discuss the reinvestment policy today.You've suggested that interest rates will stay below zero for the next year or so. Howcomfortable are you making those kind of predictions or forecasts so far into the future giveninflation is already above target and you sound relatively confident about the outlook for theeconomy and inflation?My second question is, so the ECB is holding rates below zero while the Fed is raising ratesquite quickly; I think it plans another two rate hikes this year. That's leading to a divergencebetween the two central banks, which has also weighed on the euro over the last few months.Do you think President Trump has a point when he complains about how Europe is weakeningits currencies?Draghi: On the first question, let me stress that our enhanced forward guidance, which is both date-based and state-contingent, conveys the Governing Council's expectations that key ECB interestrates, as I said in the Introductory Statement, will remain, we expect them to remain at their presentlevels at least through the summer of 2019 and, in any case, for as long as necessary to ensure thecontinued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2% over the mediumterm. Now, this enhanced forward guidance has been very effective, as broadly reflected in surveys,market commentary and market prices, in aligning expectations of the future rate path with the11/23/23, 4:10 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180726.en.html 4/9anticipations of the Governing Council. At this stage we don't see the need to modify or to add newlanguage to our forward guidance on rates.Now, on the second question, different monetary policies do reflect the response of monetaryauthorities to different positions in the business cycle. We said several times that the exchange rate isnot a policy target; that it's important for growth and price stability. There is an international consensusthat has been going on now for years \u2013 for decades, perhaps \u2013 about abstaining from competitivedevaluations, so that's the answer.Incidentally, if one looks at the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro vis-\u00e0-vis all the partners, allthe trading partners, as a matter of fact the euro has appreciated considerably over the last year, year-and-a-half.I have a question again about the impact of protectionism. You obviously mentioned that youtake note of the agreement. But also in your accounts of the last meeting you said that theimpact on inflation from potential protectionist measures could be \u2013 is ambiguous, uncertain.Have you taken a deeper look into it and maybe you have already answers or a potential impactfrom those effects?My second question: I know that you mentioned you didn't discuss reinvestment policies, butcould you give us a broad outline on sort of your red lines where reinvestment policies won'tchange in the second phase when the net asset purchases are over?Draghi: On protectionism, no, we haven't done any further analysis than I have outlined last time andthe reason is that we basically have to see exactly what's going to be implemented. We've seen andwe have analysed that the implemented, the direct effects of implemented tariffs, as I said last time,are limited. But clearly, a trade war where you have rounds of retaliation and rounds of responseswould create an entirely different climate. We would have to assess both the direct effects, which maybe significant as the numbers significantly go up, and the indirect effects of confidence on \u2013 especiallyon business investment. We haven't done anything different from last time yet, so we'll have to assessin the future.Now, on the reinvestment, we haven't discussed it. Certainly, just to make it clear, the capital keyremains our anchor in what we do on reinvestments, just to clear the slate from any doubt. That's it.I have two questions as well: one on euro economic optimism for the eurozone becauselooking also at recent confidence indicators, there is a clear sign that the looming tradeuncertainties have an impact already now and also looking at the current earning season. Whatmakes you still so optimistic?Second question would be on: given the inflation rate being back at your target, whether thereis an increasing discussion inside the Governing Council among its members. Of course thatit\u2019s perhaps time to even decrease the monetary stimulus in place.Draghi: I think the best way to answer both questions is to give you a short account of what's been ourdiscussion today. Well, first of all, the Governing Council took note that there hasn't been much of achange since last time; has not been a change in the assessment of the outlook \u2013 of the medium-termoutlook \u2013 for growth or inflation, nor in the monetary policy message.", "17": "11/23/23, 4:16 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190725~547f29c369.en.html 1/12INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEMario Draghi, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-Presidentof the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 25 July 2019Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council, whichwas also attended by the Commission Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interestrates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels at least through the firsthalf of 2020, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergenceof inflation to our aim over the medium term.We intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchasedunder the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when we startraising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourableliquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.The Governing Council also underlined the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetarypolicy for a prolonged period of time, as inflation rates, both realised and projected, have beenpersistently below levels that are in line with its aim. Accordingly, if the medium-term inflation outlookcontinues to fall short of our aim, the Governing Council is determined to act, in line with itscommitment to symmetry in the inflation aim. It therefore stands ready to adjust all of its instruments,as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner.In this context, we have tasked the relevant Eurosystem Committees with examining options, includingways to reinforce our forward guidance on policy rates, mitigating measures, such as the design of atiered system for reserve remuneration, and options for the size and composition of potential new netasset purchases.Incoming information since the last Governing Council meeting in early June indicates that, whilefurther employment gains and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilience of the economy,softening global growth dynamics and weak international trade are still weighing on the euro areaoutlook. Moreover, the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the risingthreat of protectionism, and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, is dampening economic sentiment,notably in the manufacturing sector. In this environment, inflationary pressures remain muted andindicators of inflation expectations have declined. Therefore, a significant degree of monetary stimuluscontinues to be necessary to ensure that financial conditions remain very favourable and support theeuro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, headline inflationdevelopments over the medium term.Jump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:16 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190725~547f29c369.en.html 2/12Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Followinga rise of 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2018, euro area real GDP increased by 0.4%, quarter on quarter,in the first quarter of 2019. Incoming economic data and survey information continue to point tosomewhat slower growth in the second and third quarters of this year. This mainly reflects the ongoingweakness in international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties, which areparticularly affecting the euro area manufacturing sector. At the same time, activity levels in theservices and construction sectors are resilient and the labour market is still improving. Looking ahead,the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, furtheremployment gains and rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing\u2013 albeit somewhat slower \u2013 growth in global activity.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, reflecting theprolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism,and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.Euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 1.3% in June 2019, from 1.2 % in May, as higher HICPinflation excluding food and energy more than offset lower energy price inflation. On the basis ofcurrent futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline over the coming months, before risingagain towards the end of the year. Looking through the recent volatility due to temporary factors,measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted. Indicators of inflation expectations havedeclined. While labour cost pressures have strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacityutilisation and tightening labour markets, the pass-through of cost pressures to inflation is taking longerthan previously anticipated. Over the medium term underlying inflation is expected to increase,supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and stronger wagegrowth.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth stood at 4.5% in June 2019, after 4.8%in May. Sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the privatesector and low opportunity costs of holding M3. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continues to bethe main contributor to broad money growth on the components side.The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations remained unchanged at 3.8% in June2019. Notwithstanding some moderation from the peak recorded in September 2018, the annualgrowth rate of loans to non-financial corporations continues to be robust. The annual growth rate ofloans to households also remained unchanged at 3.3% in June, continuing its gradual improvement.Overall, loan growth is still benefiting from historically low bank lending rates. The euro area banklending survey for the second quarter of 2019 indicates that loan growth continued to be supported byincreasing demand across all loan categories. At the same time, credit standards for loans toenterprises tightened in the second quarter amid concerns about the economic outlook, while theyremained broadly unchanged for loans for house purchase.Our monetary policy measures, including the forthcoming new series of targeted longer-termrefinancing operations (TLTRO III), will help to safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and willcontinue to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for11/23/23, 4:16 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190725~547f29c369.en.html 3/12the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over themedium term.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contributemore decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. Theimplementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up toboost euro area productivity and growth potential, reduce structural unemployment and increaseresilience. The 2019 country-specific recommendations should serve as the relevant signpost.Regarding fiscal policies, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance is providing support toeconomic activity. At the same time, countries where government debt is high need to continuerebuilding fiscal buffers. All countries should reinforce their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendlycomposition of public finances. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of theEuropean Union\u2019s fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remainsessential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economicand Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urgesfurther specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union.We are now at your disposal for questions.* * *Mr Draghi, could you perhaps elaborate whether this decision to pronounce a potentialpackage as soon as September was taken unanimously?The second question would be on the potential APP; are there any restrictions in terms of assetclasses or do you look at the whole variety of what is out there?First let me give a sort of summary account of our discussion as it's taken place. First of all, the firstdiscussion where there was broad agreement, broad convergence of views, was the assessment ofthe current outlook; namely an outlook where you still see signs of strength in the economy as I justread. Labour market and nominal wage growth support consumption. Generally speaking, you haveresilience in the service sector and the construction sector. At the same time, this outlook is gettingworse and worse and it's getting worse and worse in manufacturing especially. It's getting worse andworse in those countries where manufacturing is very important. But because of value chains, thispropagates all over the Eurozone and so this must be taken into account. The reasons were basicallyfound to be in the general uncertainty that's now been with us for several months, actually more than ayear, and which relates as I said many times to trade wars, to geopolitical tensions, too.Now, also the possibility of a hard Brexit certainly is another factor to take into account and the slowrotation of the Chinese economy, all these factors and probably others are affecting the presentoutlook and weakening it. That's the situation. Our last projections were in a sense suggesting that wemight have had a rebound in the second part of the year. Now incoming signs show weakness ofgrowth in the third quarter as well. So this rebound becomes less likely now. All in all, the balance ofrisk was assessed to be on the downside, for the reasons that I've just mentioned, and also for thevery fact that the simple \u2013 and this point I've made at other times \u2013 the simple prolonged lingering ofthis uncertainty is by itself a materialisation of one of these risks. On the inflation side, we basicallysaw inflation which is below our aim and we see projected inflation that says that convergence is11/23/23, 4:16 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190725~547f29c369.en.html 4/12further out in time, though as I've said on another occasion, the informational content of market-basedinflation expectations has to be assessed, taking into account certain technical conditions of thesemarkets. However also in the SPF, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, inflation expectations havegone down so that's what led the Governing Council to these proposals, to the various proposals. So,if I can go through them again: First of all the introduction of the easing bias through the introduction ofthe word \u201clower\u201d, and at least through the first half of 2020 and in any case, for as long as necessary toensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to our aim over the medium term. You will seein the set of proposals all over a consistent degree of optionality, very much in the same way we'vedone on other occasions. We intend to continue reinvesting in full the principle payments for maturingsecurities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past thedate when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case, for as long as necessary tomaintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.Then we move to this point where we underline the need for a highly accommodative stance onmonetary policy for a prolonged period of time. The acknowledgement that inflation rates, both realisedand projected, have been persistently below levels that are in line with our aim. This again is new toour language. Then it says accordingly if the medium term \u2013 and this is the trigger for our action, whichbasically reflects very much what I'd said in Sintra \u2013 outlook continues to fall short of our aim, theGoverning Council is determined to act. That's the third point; determination to act. Then there isanother new language here: in line with its commitment to symmetry in its inflation aim. So that'sanother part of the language that is new. That says again what I said in Sintra but it moves a stepforward; namely that we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments as appropriate to ensure thatinflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner.Then there is another new part where we say that we've tasked the relevant Eurosystem Committees,so we not only affirm our determination but we move a step forward. We task the committees withexamining options, including ways to reinforce our forward guidance on policy rates, mitigatingmeasures such as the design of a tiered system for reserve remuneration and options for the size andcomposition of potential new net asset purchases.To answer your question - was this unanimous? We had a broad discussion. On certain things weconverged, like the outlook. On other things most people converged with this, otherwise we wouldn'thave this in the introductory statement. But again whenever we have a package so complex as this,you would expect that people have different nuances about different parts of the package. The point isthat it was approved as a package after a fairly broad discussion, by converging to what I have justread to you. So that's what it is at this point in time.You asked me more specifically about the mandate to the committees. It's a broad mandate. We'rehere, we have a list, that's what we know, that's where we stand, ready to act. That's what we havehad in the past and that's what the language says, basically.The first question is about the ECB's objective. The close, but below, 2% is no longer in themonetary policy decision; it's in your introductory statement but not in the decision, so doesthat mean something? Can we expect the ECB to rephrase, redefine its policy objective?The second question is about the constraints that the ECB has chosen to force upon itself onthe PSPP. Now, there are two key constraints; one is the capital key and the other one is the", "18": "11/23/23, 4:01 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200716~3865f74bf8.en.html 1/12INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 16 July 2020Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council, whichwas also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.Incoming information since our last monetary policy meeting in early June signals a resumption of euroarea economic activity, although the level of activity remains well below the levels prevailing before thecoronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the outlook remains highly uncertain. Both high-frequency andsurvey indicators bottomed out in April and showed a significant, though uneven and partial, recoveryin May and June, alongside the ongoing containment of the virus and the associated easing of thelockdown measures. At the same time, actual and expected job and income losses and theexceptionally elevated uncertainty about the evolution of the pandemic and the economic outlookcontinue to weigh on consumer spending and business investment. Headline inflation is beingdampened by lower energy prices and price pressures are expected to remain very subdued onaccount of the sharp decline in real GDP growth and the associated significant increase in economicslack.Against this background, ample monetary stimulus remains necessary to support the economicrecovery and to safeguard medium-term price stability. Therefore, we decided to reconfirm our veryaccommodative monetary policy stance.We will keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present orlower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to,but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected inunderlying inflation dynamics.We will continue our purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with atotal envelope of \u20ac1,350 billion. These purchases contribute to easing the overall monetary policystance, thereby helping to offset the pandemic-related downward shift in the projected path of inflation.The purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes andamong jurisdictions. This allows us to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetarypolicy. We will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until at least the end of June 2021 and, inany case, until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. We will reinvestthe principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of2022. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference withthe appropriate monetary policy stance.Jump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:01 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200716~3865f74bf8.en.html 2/12Net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of \u20ac20billion, together with the purchases under the additional \u20ac120 billion temporary envelope until the endof the year. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long asnecessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before westart raising the key ECB interest rates. We intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principalpayments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past thedate when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary tomaintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.We will also continue to provide ample liquidity through our refinancing operations. In particular, thelatest operation in the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) hasregistered a very high take-up of funds, supporting bank lending to firms and households.The monetary policy measures that we have taken since early March are providing crucial support tounderpin the recovery of the euro area economy and to safeguard medium-term price stability. Inparticular, they support liquidity and funding conditions in the economy, help to sustain the flow ofcredit to households and firms, and contribute to maintaining favourable financing conditions for allsectors and jurisdictions. At the same time, in the current environment of elevated uncertainty andsignificant economic slack, the Governing Council remains fully committed to doing everythingnecessary within its mandate to support all citizens of the euro area through this extremely challengingtime. This applies first and foremost to our role in ensuring that our monetary policy is transmitted to allparts of the economy and to all jurisdictions in the pursuit of our price stability mandate. The GoverningCouncil, therefore, continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensurethat inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Incomingdata and survey results suggest that economic activity improved significantly in May and June from itstrough in April, alongside the ongoing containment of the virus and the associated easing of thelockdown measures. At the same time, economic indicators remain well below the levels recordedbefore the pandemic, and the recovery is in its early stages and remains uneven across sectors andjurisdictions. After decreasing by 3.6%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2020, euro area realGDP is expected to have contracted even further overall in the second quarter, broadly in line with theJune 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. Signs of a recovery in consumption haveemerged, while there has also been a significant rebound in industrial output. At the same time,subdued labour market conditions and precautionary household saving are weighing on consumerspending. Weak business prospects and high uncertainty are dampening investment, while theweakness in the global economy is hampering foreign demand for euro area goods and services.Euro area activity is expected to rebound in the third quarter as the containment measures are easedfurther, supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a resumptionin global activity, although uncertainty about the overall speed and scale of the rebound remains high.In general, the extent of the contraction and the recovery will depend crucially on the duration andeffectiveness of the containment measures, the success of policies to mitigate the adverse impact onincomes and employment, and the extent to which supply capacity and domestic demand are11/23/23, 4:01 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200716~3865f74bf8.en.html 3/12permanently affected. Overall, the Governing Council assesses the balance of risks to the euro areagrowth outlook to remain on the downside.According to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 0.3% in June,from 0.1% in May, mainly reflecting less negative energy price inflation. On the basis of current andfutures prices for oil and taking into account the temporary reduction in the German VAT rate, headlineinflation is likely to decline again in the coming months before picking up in early 2021. Over themedium term, weaker demand will put downward pressure on inflation, which will be only partiallyoffset by upward pressures related to supply constraints. Market-based indicators of longer-terminflation expectations have continued to increase from the historical lows reached in mid-March, butoverall remain at subdued levels. While survey-based indicators of inflation expectations have declinedsince the start of the pandemic, longer-term expectations have been less affected than short andmedium-term expectations.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth increased to 8.9% in May 2020, from8.2% in April. Strong money growth reflects bank credit creation, which continues to be driven to alarge extent by the acute liquidity needs in the economy. Moreover, high economic uncertainty istriggering a shift towards money holdings for precautionary reasons. In this environment, the narrowmonetary aggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the maincontributor to broad money growth.Developments in loans to the private sector continued to be shaped by the impact of the coronaviruson economic activity. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rose further to 7.3%in May 2020, from 6.6% in April, reflecting firms\u2019 need to finance their ongoing expenditures andworking capital in the context of still anaemic revenues. At the same time, the annual growth rate ofloans to households remained unchanged at 3.0% in May, after declining for two consecutive months,amid ongoing constraints on consumption.The results of the euro area bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2020 provide furtherinsights into these developments. With regard to firms, they show a continued strong upward impact ofthe pandemic on demand for loans, largely driven by emergency liquidity needs, while financing needsfor fixed investment declined. Credit standards on loans to firms remained broadly unchanged. Thetightening impact of the deterioration in the economic outlook and the associated decline in thecreditworthiness of firms was broadly offset by the easing effects of policy measures, particularly theECB\u2019s liquidity-support measures and government guarantees on loans. However, looking ahead,banks expect a net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms, in part related to the expected endof the state guarantee schemes. With regard to loans to households, credit standards tightened,reflecting in particular a deterioration in households\u2019 income and employment prospects in the contextof the pandemic.Overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments andEuropean institutions, will continue to support access to financing, including for those most affected bythe ramifications of the pandemic.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary for therobust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.11/23/23, 4:01 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200716~3865f74bf8.en.html 4/12Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of thesharp contraction in the euro area economy. Measures taken in response to the pandemic emergencyshould as much as possible be targeted and temporary in nature. The three safety nets endorsed bythe European Council for workers, businesses and sovereigns, amounting to a package worth \u20ac540billion, provide important funding support in this context. At the same time, the Governing Councilurges further strong and timely efforts to prepare and support the recovery. We therefore stronglywelcome the European Commission\u2019s Next Generation EU proposal, which is dedicated to supportingthe regions and sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, to strengthening the Single Market and tobuilding a lasting and prosperous recovery. It is important for the European leaders to quickly agree onan ambitious package.In order to reach its full potential, the European Union\u2019s Recovery and Resilience Facility will need tobe firmly rooted in sound structural policies conceived and implemented at the national level. Well-designed structural policies could contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery from thecrisis, thereby supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area. Targeted structuralpolicies are particularly important to rejuvenate our economies, with a focus on acceleratinginvestment in priority areas such as the green and digital transitions.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *My first question would be on what your response is to those who are suggesting that the fullenvelope of the PEPP might actually not be needed and that you perhaps could spare some ofthe money.The second question is: there is a lot of talk also about the potential for a two-speed recoveryin the Eurozone, with countries like Germany doing better than countries worst affected by thepandemic. Is that a concern to you as well and how can we prevent that?Lagarde: Your first question on the PEPP as to whether it will be used in full or not, let me first of allremind you that the PEPP has a dual function and has had that function ever since inception. It wasreally in the birth certificate of PEPP on day one. The first function is to address the risk of marketfragmentation and impairment to monetary policy transmission. The second function is to ease themonetary policy stance in light of the contraction that resulted from COVID-19. In addition to the dualfunction, the PEPP is also marked by flexibility, which is one of its key elements, and we have madefull use of it. We have frontloaded purchases. Just to remind you, we have purchased over \u20ac360 billionin the first couple of months. That was at the end of June, effectively, and we will make use of thatflexibility.As some of you have noted, we have slowed down a little bit the pace of purchases because financialmarkets have been more stable, because the fragmentation risk has really significantly been reduced.But having said that, the overall envelope and the horizon of PEPP were calibrated in order to meetboth functions. Therefore \u2013 and we don't see it for the moment, frankly \u2013 but unless there weresignificant upside surprises, our baseline remains that we will use the entire envelope of the PEPP. Ifthere were those very significant upsides then we shall see, but this is not what is in the cards at themoment. Clearly, the second function of the PEPP that I have mentioned, \u2013 which is the monetary", "19": "11/23/23, 3:58 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210722~13e7f5e795.en.html 1/12MONET ARY POLICY  STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 22 July 2021Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.At today\u2019s meeting, the Governing Council focused on two main topics: first, the implications of ourstrategy review for our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates; and, second, our assessmentof the economy and our pandemic measures.In our recent strategy review, we agreed a symmetric inflation target of two per cent over the mediumterm. Our policy rates have been close to their lower bound for some time and the medium-termoutlook for inflation is still well below our target. In these conditions, the Governing Council todayrevised its forward guidance on interest rates. We did so to underline our commitment to maintain apersistently accommodative monetary policy stance to meet our inflation target.In support of our symmetric two per cent inflation target and in line with our monetary policy strategy,the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levelsuntil we see inflation reaching two per cent well ahead of the end of our projection horizon and durablyfor the rest of the projection horizon, and we judge that realised progress in underlying inflation issufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at two per cent over the medium term.This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target.Let me turn to the assessment of the economic outlook and our pandemic measures.The recovery in the euro area economy is on track. More and more people are getting vaccinated, andlockdown restrictions have been eased in most euro area countries. But the pandemic continues tocast a shadow, especially as the delta variant constitutes a growing source of uncertainty. Inflation haspicked up, although this increase is expected to be mostly temporary. The outlook for inflation over themedium term remains subdued.We need to preserve favourable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy over the pandemicperiod. This is essential for the current rebound to turn into a lasting expansion and to offset thenegative impact of the pandemic on inflation. Therefore, having confirmed our June assessment offinancing conditions and the inflation outlook, we continue to expect purchases under the pandemicemergency purchase programme (PEPP) over the current quarter to be conducted at a significantlyhigher pace than during the first months of the year.We also confirmed our other measures to support our price stability mandate, namely the level of thekey ECB interest rates, our purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), our reinvestmentpolicies and our longer-term refinancing operations, as detailed in the  published at 13:45Jump to the transcript of the questions and answerspress release11/23/23, 3:58 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210722~13e7f5e795.en.html 2/12today. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation stabilisesat our two per cent target over the medium term.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing, and then talk aboutour assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityThe economy rebounded in the second quarter of the year and, as restrictions are eased, is on trackfor strong growth in the third quarter. We expect manufacturing to perform strongly, even thoughsupply bottlenecks are holding back production in the near term. The reopening of large parts of theeconomy is supporting a vigorous bounce-back in the services sector. But the delta variant of thecoronavirus could dampen this recovery in services, especially in tourism and hospitality.As people return to shops and restaurants and resume travelling, consumer spending is rising. Betterjob prospects, increasing confidence and continued government support are reinforcing spending. Theongoing recovery in domestic and global demand is boosting optimism among businesses. Thissupports investment. For the first time since the start of the pandemic, our bank lending surveyindicates that funding of fixed investment is an important factor driving the demand for loans to firms.We expect economic activity to return to its pre-crisis level in the first quarter of next year. But there isstill a long way to go before the damage to the economy caused by the pandemic is offset. Thenumber of people in job retention schemes has been declining but remains high. Overall, there are still3.3 million fewer people employed than before the pandemic, especially among the younger and lowerskilled.Ambitious, targeted and coordinated fiscal policy should continue to complement monetary policy insupporting the recovery. In this context, the Next Generation EU programme has a key role to play. Itwill contribute to a stronger and uniform recovery across euro area countries. It will also accelerate thegreen and digital transitions and support necessary structural reforms that lift long-term growth.InflationInflation was 1.9 per cent in June. We expect inflation to increase further over the coming months andto decline again next year. The current increase is largely being driven by higher energy prices and bybase effects from the sharp fall in oil prices at the start of the pandemic and the impact of thetemporary VAT reduction in Germany last year. By early 2022, the impact of these factors should fadeout as they fall out of the year-on-year inflation calculation.In the near term, the significant slack in the economy is holding back underlying inflationary pressures.Stronger demand and temporary cost pressures in the supply chain will put some upward pressure onprices. But weak wage growth and the past appreciation of the euro mean that price pressures willlikely remain subdued for some time.There is still some way to go before the fallout from the pandemic on inflation is eliminated. As theeconomy recovers, supported by our monetary policy measures, we expect inflation to rise over themedium term, although remaining below our target. While measures of longer-term inflationexpectations have increased, they remain some distance from our two per cent target.11/23/23, 3:58 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210722~13e7f5e795.en.html 3/12Risk assessmentWe see the risks to the economic outlook as broadly balanced. Economic activity could outperform ourexpectations if consumers spend more than currently expected and draw more rapidly on the savingsthey have built up during the pandemic. A faster improvement in the pandemic situation could also leadto a stronger expansion than currently envisaged. But growth could underperform our expectations ifthe pandemic intensifies or if supply shortages turn out to be more persistent and hold backproduction.Financial and monetary conditionsThe recovery of growth and inflation still depends on favourable financing conditions. Market interestrates have declined since our last meeting. Financing conditions for most firms and households remainat favourable levels.Bank lending rates for firms and households remain historically low. Firms are still well funded as aresult of their borrowing in the first wave of the pandemic, which in part explains why lending to firmshas slowed. By contrast, lending to households is holding up. Our most recent bank lending surveyshows that credit conditions for both firms and households have stabilised. Liquidity remains abundant.At the same time, the cost for firms of issuing equity is still high. Many firms and households havetaken on more debt to weather the pandemic. Any worsening of the economy could therefore threatentheir financial health, which could trickle through to the quality of banks\u2019 balance sheets. It remainsessential to prevent balance sheet strains and tightening financing conditions from reinforcing eachother.ConclusionSumming up, the euro area economy is rebounding strongly. But the outlook continues to depend onthe course of the pandemic and progress with vaccinations. The current rise in inflation is expected tobe largely temporary. Underlying price pressures will likely increase gradually, although leavinginflation over the medium term still well below our target. Our policy measures, including our revisedforward guidance, will help the economy shift to a solid recovery and, ultimately, bring inflation to ourtwo per cent target.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *Could you run me through your discussion on changing the forward guidance? We hear thatyou couldn't get unanimity on the guidance two weeks ago. Did that happen today? Was theforward guidance supported unanimously or was there dissent? How is this guidance differentthan what you discussed two weeks ago?Second question is about the Delta variant, which you mentioned a couple of times: we knowit's more contagious and UK infection numbers are rising quite rapidly. Do you see a risk thatthe emergency phase of the pandemic will last longer than now many think because of Delta?Is Delta properly factored into your risk assessment?11/23/23, 3:58 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210722~13e7f5e795.en.html 4/12Lagarde: Well, I will need at least an hour to go through all your questions! You cover huge ground, solet me tackle your first question, which had to do with how we reached our decision in relation toforward guidance. Let me take you back just a little bit to our strategy review and the strategy \u2013 themonetary policy strategy that we adopted unanimously. You have to think in terms of the strategy thatwe adopted as the framework within which we weave monetary policy. There was unanimity on theframework. This is really the basis against which we develop monetary policy as we go, and dependingon circumstances, so unanimity there.There was unanimous agreement around the table that we had to revise our forward guidance, andthat forward guidance had to implement our strategy review. We did not have unanimity, but we had anoverwhelming majority about the calibration of the forward guidance on ECB interest rates. That's whatI had anticipated and what matters most is the fact that directionally, we were all on the same pageand determined to revise the forward guidance as we did, but also to make sure that it is geared toimplement our strategy. So that's very bluntly how it happens and what matters really is this chain ofevents, if you will, amongst us.Now, you asked me to dissect the forward guidance that we adopted, and if you don't mind, I am goingto take you through a little exercise of going through that long sentence, which is probably the one thatis a little bit more lengthy in the whole presentation that I gave you. It's a bit more lengthy because theforward guidance rests on three key criteria, if you will, or three legs of forward guidance. I will takeyou through that. First of all, in support of our symmetric 2% inflation target and in line with ourmonetary policy strategy, so we are well anchored in our strategy. We remind ourselves that we aretargeting 2% inflation and our commitment is symmetric. The Governing Council, so it is not relying onany kind of projections. It is the Governing Council in its judgement that expects the key ECB interestrates to remain at their present or lower levels until \u2013 and that's when it begins to be important \u2013 wesee inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of our projection horizon. That's leg number 1.Leg number 2: durably for the rest of the projection horizon and, third leg, we judge that realisedprogress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2%over the medium term. We add to that a sentence that you might remember from the strategy review,which is: this may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target. So, bythese three legs we are essentially saying, first of all, that we want to see inflation reach 2[]% wellahead of the end of our projection horizon. Now, you might say, what is well ahead? Well ahead first ofall is determined by judgement of the Governing Council but it is essentially the midpoint in our overallhorizon.Just to remind those of you who do not necessarily know what our projection horizon is, at the momentwe project '21, '22, '23. So, we want to see at least 2% on the horizon, but well ahead of the end of thishorizon. The second aspect is that we want that 2% to be durable, so we want it \u2013 and that's thesecond part of the statement \u2013 it says: durably for the rest of the projection horizon. So, it can oscillatea little bit but it cannot go below 2%, essentially. The third one, which is important as well, is that wewant to look at the current circumstances and in particular the current underlying inflation, to seewhether directionally these underlying inflation components actually lead us into that upward trend thatwill help us reach the 2% target that we are committed to. So you've got three legs: one that is in thepresent, you could argue that there is an element of outcome based in that one, where we look at the1", "20": "11/23/23, 4:00 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220721~51ef267c68.en.html 1/12MONET ARY POLICY  STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 21 July 2022Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.Today, in line with our strong commitment to our price stability mandate, the Governing Council tookfurther key steps to make sure inflation returns to our two per cent target over the medium term. Wedecided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and approved the TransmissionProtection Instrument (TPI).The Governing Council judged that it is appropriate to take a larger first step on its policy ratenormalisation path than signalled at its previous meeting. This decision is based on our updatedassessment of inflation risks and the reinforced support provided by the TPI for the effectivetransmission of monetary policy. It will support the return of inflation to our medium-term target bystrengthening the anchoring of inflation expectations and by ensuring that demand conditions adjust todeliver our inflation target in the medium term.At our upcoming meetings, further normalisation of interest rates will be appropriate. The frontloadingtoday of the exit from negative interest rates allows us to make a transition to a meeting-by-meetingapproach to our interest rate decisions. Our future policy rate path will continue to be data-dependentand will help us deliver on our two per cent inflation target over the medium term. In the context of ourpolicy normalisation, we will evaluate options for remunerating excess liquidity holdings.We assessed that the establishment of the TPI is necessary to support the effective transmission ofmonetary policy. In particular, as we continue normalising monetary policy, the TPI will ensure that ourmonetary policy stance is transmitted smoothly across all euro area countries. The singleness of ourmonetary policy is a precondition for the ECB to be able to deliver on its price stability mandate.The TPI will be an addition to our toolkit and can be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderlymarket dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across the euroarea. The scale of TPI purchases depends on the severity of the risks facing policy transmission.Purchases are not restricted ex ante. By safeguarding the transmission mechanism, the TPI will allowthe Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.In any event, the flexibility in reinvestments of redemptions coming due in the pandemic emergencypurchase programme (PEPP) portfolio remains the first line of defence to counter risks to thetransmission mechanism related to the pandemic.The decisions taken today are set out in a  available on our website. The details of theTPI are described in a separate press release to be published at 15:45 CET.Jump to the transcript of the questions and answerspress release11/23/23, 4:00 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220721~51ef267c68.en.html 2/12I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explainour assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityEconomic activity is slowing. Russia\u2019s unjustified aggression towards Ukraine is an ongoing drag ongrowth. The impact of high inflation on purchasing power, continuous supply constraints and higheruncertainty are having a dampening effect on the economy. Firms continue to face higher costs anddisruptions in their supply chains, although there are tentative signs that some of the supplybottlenecks are easing. Taken together, these factors are significantly clouding the outlook for thesecond half of 2022 and beyond.At the same time, economic activity continues to benefit from the reopening of the economy, a stronglabour market and fiscal policy support. In particular, the full reopening of the economy is supportingspending in the services sector. As people start to travel again, tourism is expected to help theeconomy in the third quarter of this year. Consumption is being supported by the savings thathouseholds built up during the pandemic and by a strong labour market.Fiscal policy is helping to cushion the impact of the war in Ukraine for those bearing the brunt of higherenergy prices. Temporary and targeted measures should be tailored so as to limit the risk of fuellinginflationary pressures. Fiscal policies in all countries should aim at preserving debt sustainability, aswell as raising the growth potential in a sustainable manner to enhance the recovery.InflationInflation increased further to 8.6 per cent in June. Surging energy prices were again the mostimportant component of overall inflation. Market-based indicators suggest that global energy prices willstay high in the near term. Food inflation also rose further, standing at 8.9 per cent in June, in partreflecting the importance of Ukraine and Russia as producers of agricultural goods.Persistent supply bottlenecks for industrial goods and recovering demand, especially in the servicessector, are also contributing to the current high rates of inflation. Price pressures are spreading acrossmore and more sectors, in part owing to the indirect impact of high energy costs across the wholeeconomy. Accordingly, most measures of underlying inflation have risen further.We expect inflation to remain undesirably high for some time, owing to continued pressures fromenergy and food prices and pipeline pressures in the pricing chain. Higher inflationary pressures arealso stemming from the depreciation of the euro exchange rate. But looking further ahead, in theabsence of new disruptions, energy costs should stabilise and supply bottlenecks should ease, which,together with the ongoing policy normalisation, should support the return of inflation to our target.The labour market remains strong. Unemployment fell to a historical low of 6.6 per cent in May. Jobvacancies across many sectors show that there is robust demand for labour. Wage growth, alsoaccording to forward-looking indicators, has continued to increase gradually over the last few months,but still remains contained overall. Over time, the strengthening of the economy and some catch-upeffects should support faster growth in wages. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations11/23/23, 4:00 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220721~51ef267c68.en.html 3/12currently stand at around two per cent, although recent above-target revisions to some indicatorswarrant continued monitoring.Risk assessmentA prolongation of the war in Ukraine remains a source of significant downside risk to growth, especiallyif energy supplies from Russia were to be disrupted to such an extent that it led to rationing for firmsand households. The war may also further dampen confidence and aggravate supply-side constraints,while energy and food costs could remain persistently higher than expected. A faster deceleration inglobal growth would also pose a risk to the euro area outlook.The risks to the inflation outlook continue to be on the upside and have intensified, particularly in theshort term. The risks to the medium-term inflation outlook include a durable worsening of theproduction capacity of our economy, persistently high energy and food prices, inflation expectationsrising above our target and higher than anticipated wage rises. However, if demand were to weakenover the medium term, it would lower pressures on prices.Financial and monetary conditionsMarket interest rates have been volatile as a result of the pronounced economic and geopoliticaluncertainty. Bank funding costs have risen in recent months, which has increasingly fed into higherbank lending rates, in particular for households. While the volume of bank lending to householdsremains strong, it is expected to decline in view of lower demand. Lending to firms has also beenrobust as high production costs, inventory building and lower reliance on market funding have createda continued need for credit from banks. At the same time, demand for loans to finance investment hasdeclined. Money growth has continued to moderate owing to lower liquid savings and lowerEurosystem asset purchases.Our most recent bank lending survey reports that credit standards tightened for all loan categories inthe second quarter of the year, as banks are becoming more concerned about the risks faced by theircustomers in the current uncertain environment. Banks expect to continue tightening their creditstandards in the third quarter.ConclusionSumming up, inflation continues to be undesirably high and is expected to remain above our target forsome time. The latest data indicate a slowdown in growth, clouding the outlook for the second half of2022 and beyond. At the same time, this slowdown is being cushioned by a number of supportivefactors.The Governing Council has today decided to raise the key ECB interest rates and approved the TPI. Atour upcoming meetings, further normalisation of interest rates will be appropriate. Our future policyrate path will continue to be data-dependent and will help us deliver on our two per cent inflation targetover the medium term.We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation stabilises atour two per cent target over the medium term.

We are seeing yields rising with the political uncertainty atcentre stage. What's your message to the market? Is the TPI big enough and bold enough toprevent a potential escalation of the situation?Actually, your question helps me give you a bit of an insight of what happened during this reallyimportant Governing Council meeting. Governing Council members around the table made twoimportant decisions. The first one had to do with interest rate hikes by 50 basis points \u2013 and I will comeback to forward guidance in a minute \u2013 and also decided to approve at unanimity, unanimity of theGoverning Council, the Transmission Protection Instrument. So let me come back to the interest ratehikes that we decided, and I will come back, as a result, to your forward guidance question. Wedebated internally within the Governing Council about the pros and cons of sticking to the signalled 25basis points of July, which entailed the other forward guidance that we gave in respect of September.The two of them were clearly a package. And having weighed the pros and cons we decided, onbalance, that it was appropriate to take a larger step towards exiting from negative interest rates.We did that on the basis of several indicators, several elements which we believe constituted a changerelative to our June Amsterdam meeting. And I can come back to those four elements, because I thinkthey're important. They all relate to a materialisation of inflation risks that we had flagged inAmsterdam, but which we have seen materialising in the meantime.I think the second important component that played a role in our decision was that the situation haschanged in relation to transmission. We had not implemented yet the flexible reinvestment underPEPP, and certainly we did not have at the time a transmission protection instrument. So these twoelements combined - realisation of upside risk to inflation plus the presence and the operationality ofthe flexible reinvestment under PEPP, and, more importantly, the unanimous support of the GoverningCouncil for the transmission protection instrument - led us to decide a larger-than-what-had-been-signalled rate hike on the occasion of this meeting. That is really what, if you want to go behind thecurtain of the Governing Council debates, this is what took place.I would add that in relation to the rate hikes we had the debate, weighted the pros and cons, and at theend of the discussion all members of the Governing Council rallied to the consensus of 50 basispoints. So it's a strong indication on both accounts in relation to the higher step that we are taking toexit from negative interest rates, and on the other front, which is making sure that our monetary policystance is transmitted smoothly throughout the entire euro area.Now, the TPI is, obviously, an instrument that will help us deliver on our mandate of price stability,bringing inflation in the medium term back to 2%, and under that TPI all members of the euro area canbe eligible; all of them.

We are determined toensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. The GoverningCouncil therefore today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points.The rate increase today reflects our assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlyinginflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The developments since our last meetingsupport our expectation that inflation will drop further over the remainder of the year but will stay abovetarget for an extended period. While some measures show signs of easing, underlying inflationremains high overall. Our past rate increases continue to be transmitted forcefully: financing conditionshave tightened again and are increasingly dampening demand, which is an important factor in bringinginflation back to target.Our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictivelevels for as long as necessary to achieve a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-termtarget. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level andduration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will continue to be based on ourassessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamicsof underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.We also decided to set the remuneration of minimum reserves at zero per cent. This decision willpreserve the effectiveness of monetary policy by maintaining the current degree of control over themonetary policy stance and ensuring the full pass-through of our interest rate decisions to moneymarkets. At the same time, it will improve the efficiency of monetary policy by reducing the overallamount of interest that needs to be paid on reserves in order to implement the appropriate stance.The decisions taken today are set out in a  available on our website. The details of thechange to the remuneration of minimum reserves are provided in a separate  to bepublished at 15:45 CET.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explainour assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityThe near-term economic outlook for the euro area has deteriorated, owing largely to weaker domesticdemand. High inflation and tighter financing conditions are dampening spending. This is weighingJump to the transcript of the questions and answerspress releasepress release11/23/23, 3:49 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230727~e0a11feb2e.en.html 2/11especially on manufacturing output, which is also being held down by weak external demand. Housingand business investment are showing signs of weakness as well. Services remain more resilient,especially in contact-intensive subsectors such as tourism. But momentum is slowing in the servicessector. The economy is expected to remain weak in the short run. Over time, falling inflation, risingincomes and improving supply conditions should support the recovery.The labour market remains robust. The unemployment rate stayed at its historical low of 6.5 per cent inMay and many new jobs are being created, especially in the services sector. At the same time,forward-looking indicators suggest that this trend might slow down in the coming months and may turnnegative for manufacturing.As the energy crisis fades, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and ina concerted manner. This is essential to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, whichwould otherwise call for a stronger monetary policy response. We welcome the recent Eurogroupstatement on the euro area fiscal stance, which is consistent with this assessment. Fiscal policiesshould be designed to make our economy more productive and to gradually bring down high publicdebt. Policies to enhance the euro area\u2019s supply capacity can help reduce price pressures in themedium term, while supporting the green transition, which is also being furthered by the NextGeneration EU programme. The reform of the EU\u2019s economic governance framework should beconcluded before the end of this year.InflationInflation came down further in June, reaching 5.5 per cent, after 6.1 per cent in May. Energy prices fellagain, dropping by 5.6 per cent, year on year. Food price inflation continued to slow but remained high,at 11.6 per cent.Inflation excluding energy and food edged up to 5.5 per cent in June, with goods and servicesfollowing diverging trends. Goods inflation decreased further, to 5.5 per cent, from 5.8 per cent in May.Conversely, services inflation rose to 5.4 per cent, from 5.0 per cent in May, owing to robust spendingon holidays and travel and also reflecting upward base effects.The drivers of inflation are changing. External sources of inflation are easing. By contrast, domesticprice pressures, including from rising wages and still robust profit margins, are becoming anincreasingly important driver of inflation.While some measures are moving lower, underlying inflation remains high overall, including owing tothe persistent impact of past energy price increases on economy-wide prices. Although mostmeasures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around 2 per cent, some indicatorsremain elevated and need to be monitored closely.Risk assessmentThe outlook for economic growth and inflation remains highly uncertain. Downside risks to growthinclude Russia\u2019s unjustified war against Ukraine and an increase in broader geopolitical tensions,which could fragment global trade and thus weigh on the euro area economy. Growth could also beslower if the effects of monetary policy are more forceful than expected, or if the world economy11/23/23, 3:49 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230727~e0a11feb2e.en.html 3/11weakens and thereby dampens demand for euro area exports. Conversely, growth could be higherthan projected if the strong labour market, rising real incomes and receding uncertainty mean thatpeople and businesses become more confident and spend more.Upside risks to inflation include potential renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food,also related to Russia\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative. Adverse weatherconditions, in light of the unfolding climate crisis, may push up food prices by more than projected. Alasting rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages orprofit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. By contrast, weakerdemand \u2013 for example owing to a stronger transmission of monetary policy \u2013 would lead to lower pricepressures, especially over the medium term. Moreover, inflation would come down faster if decliningenergy prices and lower food price increases were to pass through to the prices of other goods andservices more quickly than currently anticipated.Financial and monetary conditionsOur monetary policy tightening continues to be transmitted strongly to broader financing conditions.Risk-free interest rates over short to medium-term maturities have increased since our last meetingand funding has become more expensive for banks, in part owing to the ongoing phasing-out of theECB\u2019s targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). The large TLTRO repayment in Junewent smoothly, as banks were well prepared. Average lending rates for business loans and mortgagesrose again in May, to 4.6 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively.Higher borrowing rates and the associated cuts in spending plans led to a further sharp drop in creditdemand in the second quarter, as reported in our latest bank lending survey. Moreover, creditstandards for loans to firms and households tightened further, as banks are becoming more concernedabout the risks faced by their customers and are less willing to bear these risks. Tighter financingconditions are also making housing less affordable and less attractive as an investment, and demandfor mortgages has dropped for the fifth quarter in a row.Against this background, the annual growth rate of lending continued to decrease in June, falling to 3.0per cent for firms and 1.7 per cent for households, with annualised growth rates of 0.0 per cent and-0.2 per cent in the second quarter respectively. Amid weak lending and the reduction in theEurosystem balance sheet, the annual growth rate of broad money fell to 0.6 per cent in June, with anannualised growth rate of -1.1 per cent in the second quarter.ConclusionInflation continues to decline but is still expected to remain too high for too long. The GoverningCouncil therefore today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points.Our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictivelevels for as long as necessary to achieve a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-termtarget. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level andduration of restriction.

And the second one \u2013 I am wondering how much of your decision onlowering the remuneration of minimum reserves was driven by concerns over central banklosses.Let me just remind you what we have been doing. And I will come to your interest, which is whathappens next. But let me just remind you what we are doing, and what we have been doing. We areraising interest rates, all three rates by 25 basis points. And this is the ninth decision to hike that hasbeen taken in a matter of one year. So invariably, on meeting after the other, we have raised rates. TheDFR is now at 3.75. And this decision that was unanimously agreed amongst all members of theGoverning Council is driven by one key determination, which is to bring inflation to target, our target,which is medium-term inflation. There is unanimous determination to do so. What we have decided aswell, and I will come to your minimum reserves remuneration as well, because that was your secondquestion. We have also decided, and I\u2019m going to quote, because it is a sentence that you might hearover and over, not only this time, but also next time and future times. We say \u201cour future decisions willensure that the key ECB interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long asnecessary to achieve a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target. So, some of you mayhave noticed a slight change of a verb. And that is not just random or irrelevant. And I think it ispredicated on our determination to be data dependent. So, I have said on many occasions that we hadground to cover or that we have more ground to cover. What I am saying here is that data and ourassessment of data will actually tell us whether and how much ground we have to cover. So we aredeliberately data-dependent and we have an open mind as to what the decisions will be in Septemberand in subsequent meetings. Because this determination based on data might vary from one month tothe other. So we might hike and we might hold, and what is decided in September is not definitive. Itmay vary from one meeting to the other. So I hope it is very clear that we are not in the domain offorward guidance but we are very strongly rooted in our determination to break the back of inflationand to take inflation back to 2% in the medium term on a sustainable basis. And to do that, we will beinformed by data, we will analyse the data and we will then decide at that point in time. We will havethe inflation outlook, we will have two readings of inflation with all the underlying dissection andunderstanding of it. And we will have even more understanding of our monetary policy transmission.And that will be repeated every Governing Council after every Governing Council, so that we canmake sure as I said that we break the back of inflation.Now, on your second question. Our primary job is to set monetary policy so that inflation stabilises at2% over the medium term. No dispute about that. But we also have a public duty to make theimplementation of our monetary policy as efficient as possible. So by cutting the remuneration onminimum reserves only, that\u2019s the basis that we will use. Cutting it to zero, we will reduce the amount", "22": "11/23/23, 4:13 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180614.en.html 1/13INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEMario Draghi, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-Presidentof the ECB,Riga, 14 June 2018Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. I would like to thank Deputy Governor Razmusa for her kind hospitality and express ourspecial gratitude to her staff for the excellent organisation of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council.We will now report on the outcome of our meeting.Since the start of our asset purchase programme (APP) in January 2015, the Governing Council hasmade net asset purchases under the APP conditional on the extent of progress towards a sustainedadjustment in the path of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. Today, theGoverning Council undertook a careful review of the progress made, also taking into account the latestEurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, measures of price and wage pressures, anduncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook.As a result of this assessment, the Governing Council concluded that progress towards a sustainedadjustment in inflation has been substantial so far. With longer-term inflation expectations wellanchored, the underlying strength of the euro area economy and the continuing ample degree ofmonetary accommodation provide grounds to be confident that the sustained convergence of inflationtowards our aim will continue in the period ahead, and will be maintained even after a gradual winding-down of our net asset purchases.Accordingly, the Governing Council today made the following decisions:First, as regards non-standard monetary policy measures, we will continue to make net purchasesunder the APP at the current monthly pace of \u20ac30 billion until the end of September 2018. Weanticipate that, after September 2018, subject to incoming data confirming our medium-term inflationoutlook, we will reduce the monthly pace of the net asset purchases to \u20ac15 billion until the end ofDecember 2018 and then end net purchases.Second, we intend to maintain our policy of reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of our net asset purchases, andin any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degreeof monetary accommodation.Third, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged and we expect them to remain attheir present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary toensure that the evolution of inflation remains aligned with our current expectations of a sustainedadjustment path.Jump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:13 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180614.en.html 2/13Today\u2019s monetary policy decisions maintain the current ample degree of monetary accommodation thatwill ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation towards levels that are below, but closeto, 2% over the medium term. Significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the furtherbuild-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. Thissupport will continue to be provided by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by thesizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by our enhanced forwardguidance on the key ECB interest rates. In any event, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust allof its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the GoverningCouncil\u2019s inflation aim in a sustained manner.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Quarterlyreal GDP growth moderated to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2018, following growth of 0.7% in theprevious quarters. This moderation reflects a pull-back from the very high levels of growth in 2017,compounded by an increase in uncertainty and some temporary and supply-side factors at both thedomestic and the global level, as well as weaker impetus from external trade. The latest economicindicators and survey results are weaker, but remain consistent with ongoing solid and broad-basedeconomic growth. Our monetary policy measures, which have facilitated the deleveraging process,continue to underpin domestic demand. Private consumption is supported by ongoing employmentgains, which, in turn, partly reflect past labour market reforms, and by growing household wealth.Business investment is fostered by the favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitabilityand solid demand. Housing investment remains robust. In addition, the broad-based expansion inglobal demand is expected to continue, thus providing impetus to euro area exports.This assessment is broadly reflected in the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections forthe euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 2.1% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019and 1.7% in 2020. Compared with the March 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlookfor real GDP growth has been revised down for 2018 and remains unchanged for 2019 and 2020.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced. Nevertheless,uncertainties related to global factors, including the threat of increased protectionism, have becomemore prominent. Moreover, the risk of persistent heightened financial market volatility warrantsmonitoring.According to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 1.9% in May2018, from 1.2% in April. This reflected higher contributions from energy, food and services priceinflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely tohover around the current level for the remainder of the year. While measures of underlying inflationremain generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. Domestic cost pressures arestrengthening amid high levels of capacity utilisation, tightening labour markets and rising wages.Uncertainty around the inflation outlook is receding. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected topick up towards the end of the year and thereafter to increase gradually over the medium term,supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the correspondingabsorption of economic slack and rising wage growth.This assessment is also broadly reflected in the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomicprojections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.7% in 2018, 2019 and 2020.11/23/23, 4:13 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180614.en.html 3/13Compared with the March 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for headline HICPinflation has been revised up notably for 2018 and 2019, mainly reflecting higher oil prices.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth stood at 3.9% in April 2018, after 3.7%in March and 4.3% in February. While the slower momentum in M3 dynamics over recent monthsmainly reflects the reduction in the monthly net asset purchases since the beginning of the year, M3growth continues to be supported by the impact of the ECB\u2019s monetary policy measures and the lowopportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits. Accordingly, the narrow monetary aggregate M1remained the main contributor to broad money growth, although its annual growth rate has receded inrecent months from the high rates previously observed.The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 isproceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 3.3% in April 2018,unchanged from the previous month, and the annual growth rate of loans to households also remainedstable, at 2.9%.The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues tosignificantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households and credit flows across the euroarea. This is also reflected in the results of the latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises inthe euro area, which indicates that small and medium-sized enterprises in particular benefited fromimproved access to financing.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that today\u2019s monetary policy decisions will ensure the ample degree ofmonetary accommodation necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation towardslevels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contributemore decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. Theimplementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up toincrease resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growthpotential. Regarding fiscal policies, the ongoing broad-based expansion calls for rebuilding fiscalbuffers. This is particularly important in countries where government debt remains high. All countrieswould benefit from intensifying efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of publicfinances. A full, transparent and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of themacroeconomic imbalance procedure over time and across countries remains essential to increasethe resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Unionremains a priority. The Governing Council urges specific and decisive steps to complete the bankingunion and the capital markets union.We are now at your disposal for questions.* * *[Christine Graeff: Before we start with the Q&A, let me thank Zoja Razmusa, who is with ustoday as representative of the hosting central bank. Ms Razmusa will be taking questions onLatvia in general but will not answer questions on the Governing Council discussions onmonetary policy, as she's not a member of the Governing Council. Let me also clarify that we11/23/23, 4:13 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180614.en.html 4/13will not comment on the situation around the governor of Latvijas Banka, as this case ispending in front of the European Court of Justice and the ECB never comments on pendingcases. With that, I hand over the first question to Mr Speciale.]Mr President, two questions: your statement says that you will expect to keep rates on holdthrough summer 2019. Does it mean that you expect to be able to raise rates once during yourterm and - or - more than once?The second question is: in the statement as well you mentioned incoming data as one of theconditions that should confirm the current outlook. Could you describe the assessment of therisks surrounding the economic and political situation in Italy and how that may impact youreconomic outlook?Draghi: Well, frankly, we didn't discuss if we want to raise rates. We said at least through the summer \u2013let me re-read this because it's quite important. I'll come back if I have the opportunity later. We keepthem unchanged and we expect them to remain at their present levels at least, at least through thesummer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary. You see, in a sense this and the otherquestion you asked about \u201csubject to incoming data,\u201d it really tells something about the environment inwhich we took this decision when news are still good, but they're not as good as they were a quarterago, but are still solid. We see increasing uncertainty. I think I've said that. The quarterly real GDPgrowth moderated to 0.4%, so 0.4% is less than 0.7% but it's still high growth.Then we go through the various causes of this moderation. Basically, it's a pullback from the very highlevels of growth in 2017, mostly justified by an extraordinary pickup in exports, which is unlikely torepeat itself now, compounded by an increase \u2013 an undeniable increase in uncertainty - and for avariety of reasons really, mostly geopolitical reasons, and some temporary and supply-side factors atboth the domestic and the global level as well as weaker impetus from external trade. The assessmentthat the Governing Council gave of the current economic environment, of the underlying strength of theeconomy, while being overall appropriate for achieving the decisions that were taken today, doesn'twant to underplay the existing risks.By the way, we may well have this soft patch being somewhat longer than it is in the staff projections.In some countries, for example, it is foreseen that it may extend into the second quarter, but this at thesame time doesn't tell that the underlying strength isn't changed. The underlying strength of theeconomy in the medium term is what we assess to be adequate.As far as whether a specific risk may have an impact, we've seen some volatility, then it has receded.At this point in time, we have a variety of reasons \u2013 this is just one of them \u2013 which we felt is less thanit was two weeks ago.You've given a date for when you expect the first rate hike to be, but we have no real idea yetabout what happens after that. You've also said it's more of an expectation than an intention toleave rates on hold. Do you anticipate, or was there indeed any discussion, about givingstronger guidance on rates or moving to some sort of Riksbank-style model where you offerinvestors a conditional path for rate hikes?My second question: you've emphasised in the opening statement and also in some of yourremarks to Mr Speciale's question that the incoming data hasn't been so good and that the", "23": "11/23/23, 3:55 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190606~32b6221806.en.html 1/11INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEMario Draghi, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-Presidentof the ECB,Vilnius, 6 June 2019Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. I would like to thank Chairman of the Board Vasiliauskas for his kind hospitality andexpress our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today\u2019s meeting of theGoverning Council. We will now report on the outcome of our meeting.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have conducted a thorough assessmentof the economic and inflation outlook, also taking into account the latest staff macroeconomicprojections for the euro area. As a result, the Governing Council took the following decisions in thepursuit of its price stability objective.First, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We now expect them to remain attheir present levels at least through the first half of 2020, and in any case for as long as necessary toensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% overthe medium term.Second, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date whenwe start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintainfavourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.Third, regarding the modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancingoperations (TLTRO III), we decided that the interest rate in each operation will be set at a level that is10 basis points above the average rate applied in the Eurosystem\u2019s main refinancing operations overthe life of the respective TLTRO. For banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a benchmark, the rateapplied in TLTRO III will be lower, and can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facilityprevailing over the life of the operation plus 10 basis points.A press release with further details of the terms of TLTRO III will be published at 15:30 CET today.The Governing Council also assessed that, at this point in time, the positive contribution of negativeinterest rates to the accommodative monetary policy stance and to the sustained convergence ofinflation is not undermined by possible side effects on bank-based intermediation. However, we willcontinue to monitor carefully the bank-based transmission channel of monetary policy and the case formitigating measures.Today\u2019s monetary policy decisions were taken to provide the monetary accommodation necessary forinflation to remain on a sustained path towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the mediumterm. Despite the somewhat better than expected data for the first quarter, the most recent informationJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 3:55 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190606~32b6221806.en.html 2/11indicates that global headwinds continue to weigh on the euro area outlook. The prolonged presenceof uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities inemerging markets, is leaving its mark on economic sentiment.At the same time, further employment gains and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilienceof the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation. Today\u2019s policy measures ensure that financialconditions will remain very favourable, supporting the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up ofdomestic price pressures and, thus, headline inflation developments over the medium term. Lookingahead, the Governing Council is determined to act in case of adverse contingencies and also standsready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towardsthe Governing Council\u2019s inflation aim in a sustained manner.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro areareal GDP rose by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2019, following an increase of 0.2% inthe fourth quarter of 2018. However, incoming economic data and survey information point tosomewhat weaker growth in the second and third quarters of this year. This reflects the ongoingweakness in international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties, which areweighing, in particular, on the euro area manufacturing sector. At the same time, the euro areaservices and construction sectors are showing resilience and the labour market is continuing toimprove. Looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourablefinancing conditions, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance, further employment gains andrising wages, and the ongoing \u2013 albeit somewhat slower \u2013 growth in global activity.This assessment is broadly reflected in the June 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections forthe euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.2% in 2019, 1.4% in 2020and 1.4% in 2021. Compared with the March 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlookfor real GDP growth has been revised up by 0.1 percentage points for 2019 and has been reviseddown by 0.2 percentage points for 2020 and by 0.1 percentage points for 2021.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, on account of theprolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionismand vulnerabilities in emerging markets.According to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.2% in May 2019, after1.7% in April, reflecting mainly lower energy and services price inflation. On the basis of current futuresprices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline over the coming months, before rising again towardsthe end of year. Looking through the recent volatility due to temporary factors, measures of underlyinginflation remain generally muted, but labour cost pressures continue to strengthen and broaden amidhigh levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. Looking ahead, underlying inflation isexpected to increase over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoingeconomic expansion and stronger wage growth.This assessment is also broadly reflected in the June 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomicprojections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.3% in 2019, 1.4% in 2020 and1.6% in 2021. Compared with the March 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook forHICP inflation has been revised up by 0.1 percentage points for 2019 and revised down by 0.1percentage points for 2020.11/23/23, 3:55 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190606~32b6221806.en.html 3/11Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth stood at 4.7% in April 2019, after 4.6%in March. Sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the privatesector and low opportunity costs of holding M3. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continues to bethe main contributor to broad money growth on the components side.The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 3.9% in April 2019, from3.6% in March. Beyond short-term volatility, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financialcorporations has moderated somewhat in recent months from its peak in September 2018, reflectingthe typical lagged reaction to the slowdown in economic growth observed over the course of 2018. Theannual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.4% in April, compared with 3.3% in March,continuing its gradual improvement.The monetary policy measures taken today, including TLTRO III, will help to safeguard favourablebank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing, in particular for small andmedium-sized enterprises.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary forthe continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over themedium term.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contributemore decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. Theimplementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up toincrease resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growthpotential. The 2019 country-specific recommendations should serve as the relevant signpost.Regarding fiscal policies, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance is providing support toeconomic activity. At the same time, countries where government debt is high need to continuerebuilding fiscal buffers. All countries should reinforce their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendlycomposition of public finances. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of theEuropean Union\u2019s fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remainsessential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economicand Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urgesfurther specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union.We are now at your disposal for questions.* * *You said that interest rates will remain at their current levels through the first half of next year,but the market is actually pricing for the next interest rate move to be a cut. If you look at themarket reaction after you issued the policy statement, it does look like investors were actuallyexpecting more. Would you say that markets are perhaps getting ahead of themselves eventhough you have said in the past that markets are pricing in the ECB's reaction function.My second question is on market-based inflation expectations, which have continued to sliderecently. You've said in the past that that was because of negative risk premium predominantly,11/23/23, 3:55 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190606~32b6221806.en.html 4/11but how long can you continue to see market-based inflation expectations so low below youraim?Draghi: You have to distinguish between market-based expectations of interest rates and surveyexpectations. The extension of the six months of this forward guidance basically takes into account theprolongation of uncertainty with respect to what we saw and believed and deemed in March. We'veseen the threat of rising protectionism and, in fact, the point made by someone about what marketssee in this protectionism threat and they seem to see much more than simply the damage to theeconomies coming from trade. They might see a much broader phenomenon questioning all themultilateral order that we have lived in since the Second World War. Then of course the uncertaintyabout the Brexit negotiation and the uncertainty about the vulnerabilities of certain emerging marketcountries, which are important, more generally the uncertainty about global trade growth has extendedbeyond what we believed in March. That's why we have extended our forward guidance. At the sametime, data about the economy are not bad. There isn't, as you've seen, any substantial worsening inthe outlook. That's the reason for this extension by seven months.The other part, the other question is about the slide in inflation expectations. Yes, the market-basedinflation expectations. We are taking this seriously. First of all there is no probability of deflation. Thereis a very low probability of recession. There are, based on various analysis, no threats of de-anchoringinflation expectations, but certainly there is a considerable mass of distribution between zero and 1.5%now. By the way, this fall, this slide in inflation expectations is not happening only in Europe; it's alsohappening elsewhere although admittedly from higher starting levels. So there must be some sort ofglobal factor, but it's certainly something that we take into account in our policy.Could you give us your now-customary summary of the discussion? I'm especially interestedin what were the contentious points, whether there was unanimity or dissent.The second question relates to Italy: as you are really well aware, there is now a new debatebetween the Commission and Italy on fiscal policies. I'm curious, what's your message to theItalian Government about fiscal policies? I'm also curious, your thoughts about the proposal inItaly to issue mini-BOT, which seem to be against the Treaty and might be of great concern toyou.Draghi: I'll answer first the first question. Now, if I have to give a broad summary of the discussion, Iwould say it was centred on three key concepts. First of all, there is still confidence in the baseline, butin the midst of increased and prolonged uncertainty. Prolonged means that this uncertainty is not goingto go out. In March we might've hoped for a trade deal, we might've hoped for a decrease inuncertainties more generally. We might've hoped for a different evolution in the Brexit, but now it'sdifferent. That's one, but there is some acknowledgement of the economy at the same time. Basically,acknowledgement of risk. These risks have gained importance and gained projection and we can gothrough these risks one by one \u2013 more analytically. There is a third element that has characterised ourdiscussion today and you can find some words to this extent in the introductory statement; namely thereadiness to act in case of adverse contingencies.I have said this on other occasions. This time the discussion has become, I would say, more granularin the sense that \u2013 and you'll see this in the accounts of the meeting \u2013 in the sense that severalmembers raised the possibility of further rate cuts.

We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council, whichwas also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.Incoming information confirms that the euro area economy is experiencing an unprecedentedcontraction. There has been an abrupt drop in economic activity as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the measures to contain it. Severe job and income losses and exceptionallyelevated uncertainty about the economic outlook have led to a significant fall in consumer spendingand investment. While survey data and real-time indicators for economic activity have shown somesigns of a bottoming-out alongside the gradual easing of the containment measures, the improvementhas so far been tepid compared with the speed at which the indicators plummeted in the preceding twomonths. The June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections see growth declining at anunprecedented pace in the second quarter of this year, before rebounding again in the second half,crucially helped by the sizeable support from fiscal and monetary policy. Nonetheless, the projectionsentail a substantial downward revision to both the level of economic activity and the inflation outlookover the whole projection horizon, though the baseline is surrounded by an exceptional degree ofuncertainty. While headline inflation is suppressed by lower energy prices, price pressures areexpected to remain subdued on account of the sharp decline in real GDP and the associatedsignificant increase in economic slack.In line with its mandate, the Governing Council is determined to ensure the necessary degree ofmonetary accommodation and a smooth transmission of monetary policy across sectors and countries.Accordingly, we decided on a set of monetary policy measures to support the economy during itsgradual reopening and to safeguard medium-term price stability.First, the Governing Council decided to increase the envelope for the pandemic emergency purchaseprogramme (PEPP) by \u20ac600 billion to a total of \u20ac1,350 billion. In response to the pandemic-relateddownward revision to inflation over the projection horizon, the PEPP expansion will further ease thegeneral monetary policy stance, supporting funding conditions in the real economy, especially forbusinesses and households. The purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner overtime, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. This allows us to effectively stave off risks to thesmooth transmission of monetary policy.Second, we decided to extend the horizon for net purchases under the PEPP to at least the end ofJune 2021. In any case, we will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until the GoverningCouncil judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over.Jump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:13 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200604~b479b8cfff.en.html 2/12Third, the Governing Council decided to reinvest the maturing principal payments from securitiespurchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2022. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPPportfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.Fourth, net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of\u20ac20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional \u20ac120 billion temporary envelope until theend of the year. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as longas necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before westart raising the key ECB interest rates.Fifth, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the keyECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditionsand an ample degree of monetary accommodation.Sixth, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at theirpresent or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficientlyclose to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistentlyreflected in underlying inflation dynamics.Together with the substantial monetary policy stimulus already in place, today\u2019s decisions will supportliquidity and funding conditions in the economy, help to sustain the flow of credit to households andfirms, and contribute to maintaining favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions, inorder to underpin the recovery of the economy from the coronavirus fallout. At the same time, in thecurrent rapidly evolving economic environment, the Governing Council remains fully committed todoing everything necessary within its mandate to support all citizens of the euro area through thisextremely challenging time. This applies first and foremost to our role in ensuring that our monetarypolicy is transmitted to all parts of the economy and to all jurisdictions in the pursuit of our pricestability mandate. The Governing Council, therefore, continues to stand ready to adjust all of itsinstruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, inline with its commitment to symmetry.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latesteconomic indicators and survey results confirm a sharp contraction of the euro area economy andrapidly deteriorating labour market conditions. The coronavirus pandemic and the necessarycontainment measures have severely affected both the manufacturing and services sectors, taking atoll on the productive capacity of the euro area economy and on domestic demand. In the first quarterof 2020, when containment measures were only in place from mid-March in most countries, euro areareal GDP decreased by 3.8%, quarter on quarter. Information from surveys, high-frequency indicatorsand incoming hard data all point to a further significant contraction of real GDP in the second quarter.Most recent indicators suggest some bottoming-out of the downturn in May as parts of the economygradually reopen. Accordingly, euro area activity is expected to rebound in the third quarter as thecontainment measures are eased further, supported by favourable financing conditions, anexpansionary fiscal stance and a resumption in global activity, although the overall speed and scale ofthe rebound remains highly uncertain.11/23/23, 4:13 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200604~b479b8cfff.en.html 3/12This assessment is also broadly reflected in the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomicprojections for the euro area. In the baseline scenario of the projections, annual real GDP is expectedto fall by 8.7% in 2020 and to rebound by 5.2% in 2021 and by 3.3% in 2022. Compared with theMarch 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revisedsubstantially downwards by 9.5 percentage points in 2020 and revised upwards by 3.9 percentagepoints in 2021 and 1.9 percentage points in 2022.Given the exceptional uncertainty currently surrounding the outlook, the projections also include twoalternative scenarios, which we will publish on our website following this press conference. In general,the extent of the contraction and the recovery will depend crucially on the duration and theeffectiveness of the containment measures, the success of policies to mitigate the adverse impact onincomes and employment, and the extent to which supply capacity and domestic demand arepermanently affected. Overall, the Governing Council sees the balance of risks around the baselineprojection to the downside.According to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation decreased to 0.1% in May,down from 0.3% in April, mainly on account of lower energy price inflation. On the basis of current andfutures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline somewhat further over the coming monthsand to remain subdued until the end of the year. Over the medium term, weaker demand will putdownward pressure on inflation, which will be only partially offset by upward pressures related tosupply constraints. Market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have remained atdepressed levels. While survey-based indicators of inflation expectations have declined over the shortand medium term, longer-term expectations have been less affected.This assessment is also reflected in the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections forthe euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation in the baseline scenario at 0.3% in 2020, 0.8% in2021 and 1.3% in 2022. Compared with the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, theoutlook for HICP inflation has been revised downwards by 0.8 percentage points in 2020, 0.6percentage points in 2021 and 0.3 percentage points in 2022.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth increased to 8.3% in April 2020, from7.5% in March. Strong money growth reflects bank credit creation, which is driven to a large extent bythe acute liquidity needs in the economy. Moreover, high economic uncertainty is triggering a shifttowards money holdings for precautionary reasons. In this environment, the narrow monetaryaggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the main contributor tobroad money growth.Developments in loans to the private sector continued to be shaped by the impact of the coronaviruson economic activity. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rose further to 6.6%in April 2020, up from 5.5% in March, reflecting firms\u2019 need to finance their ongoing expenditures andworking capital in the context of rapidly declining revenues. At the same time, the annual growth rate ofloans to households decreased to 3.0% in April, from 3.4% in March, amid consumption constraintsdue to the containment measures, declining confidence and a deteriorating labour market.Our policy measures, in particular the very favourable terms for our targeted longer-term refinancingoperations (TLTRO III), should encourage banks to extend loans to all private sector entities. Together11/23/23, 4:13 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200604~b479b8cfff.en.html 4/12with the measures adopted by national governments and European institutions, they support ongoingaccess to financing, including for those most affected by the ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary for therobust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of thesharp contraction in the euro area economy. Measures taken should as much as possible be targetedand temporary in nature in response to the pandemic emergency. The three safety nets endorsed bythe European Council for workers, businesses and sovereigns, amounting to a package worth \u20ac540billion, provide important funding support in this context. At the same time, the Governing Councilurges further strong and timely efforts to prepare and support the recovery. We therefore stronglywelcome the European Commission\u2019s proposal for a recovery plan dedicated to supporting the regionsand sectors most severely hit by the pandemic, to strengthening the Single Market and to building alasting and prosperous recovery.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *The first question is about the composition of PEPP. I'm wondering if you've discussedincluding junk bonds into PEPP, and if not, why not given that your own stability reporthighlights the risk of downgrades to stability.The second question is about the German constitutional court\u2019s ruling, and I wonder if you'vediscussed this at all. You've of course said that you fall under the jurisdiction of the ECJ, butMs Schnabel said that the ECB can be constructive in this process. So what precisely doesconstructive mean in this context? What are you prepared to do? Are you prepared to take afresh Governing Council decision as the constitutional court is asking you to do?Lagarde: On your first question, which has to do with whether or not we include junk bonds, as you callthem, in our purchase policies. We have defined parameters for our purchases. We want to insulatethe way we conduct policy from the effect of the pandemic and avoid self-fulfilling pro-cyclicality. Wewill continue to observe the situation and take appropriate and proportionate action. Aside from that,the Governing Council has not discussed this matter.On your second point, which has to do with the Karlsruhe Court decision, I just want to remind you thatthe ECB is subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The PSPP hasbeen judged by the Court of Justice of the European Union as in line with our policy mandate. Wehave indeed taken note of the judgement, which is directed at the German government and at theGerman parliament, and we are confident that a good solution will be found. A good solution that willnot compromise the ECB's independence, will not compromise the primacy of the European Union lawor the ruling of the European Court of Justice. You follow what we do. The ECB Governing Councilregularly assesses the effectiveness, the efficiency and the cost-benefit of its monetary policymeasures. It does so on a regular basis and as you can imagine, given the package that we havedebated and eventually discussed and agreed upon, this has been the case in great depth during the", "25": "11/23/23, 3:51 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210610~115f4c0246.en.html 1/12INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 10 June 2021Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of the meeting of the Governing Council, which wasalso attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.After the contraction in the first quarter of the year, the euro area economy is gradually reopening asthe pandemic situation improves and vaccination campaigns make significant progress. The latest datasignal a bounce-back in services activity and ongoing dynamism in manufacturing production. Weexpect economic activity to accelerate in the second half of this year as further containment measuresare lifted. A pick-up in consumer spending, strong global demand and accommodative fiscal andmonetary policies will lend crucial support to the recovery. At the same time, uncertainties remain, asthe near-term economic outlook continues to depend on the course of the pandemic and on how theeconomy responds after reopening. Inflation has picked up over recent months, largely on account ofbase effects, transitory factors and an increase in energy prices. It is expected to rise further in thesecond half of the year, before declining as temporary factors fade out. Our new staff projections pointto a gradual increase in underlying inflation pressures throughout the projection horizon, although thepressures remain subdued in the context of still significant economic slack that will only be absorbedgradually over the projection horizon. Headline inflation is expected to remain below our aim over theprojection horizon.Preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period remains essential to reduceuncertainty and bolster confidence, thereby underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability. Financing conditions for firms and households have remained broadly stable sinceour monetary policy meeting in March. However, market interest rates have increased further. Whilepartly reflecting improved economic prospects, a sustained rise in market rates could translate into atightening of wider financing conditions that are relevant for the entire economy. Such a tighteningwould be premature and would pose a risk to the ongoing economic recovery and the outlook forinflation.Against this background, the Governing Council decided to confirm its very accommodative monetarypolicy stance.We will keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present orlower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to,but below, 2 per cent within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistentlyreflected in underlying inflation dynamics.Jump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 3:51 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210610~115f4c0246.en.html 2/12We will continue to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme(PEPP) with a total envelope of \u20ac1,850 billion until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case,until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. Based on a jointassessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Council expects netpurchases under the PEPP over the coming quarter to continue to be conducted at a significantlyhigher pace than during the first months of the year.We will purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening offinancing conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on theprojected path of inflation. In addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes andamong jurisdictions will continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy. If favourablefinancing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelopeover the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full. Equally, theenvelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter thenegative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.We will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under thePEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will bemanaged to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.Net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of \u20ac20billion. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long asnecessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before westart raising the key ECB interest rates.We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the keyECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditionsand an ample degree of monetary accommodation.Finally, we will continue to provide ample liquidity through our refinancing operations. The fundingobtained through the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) plays acrucial role in supporting bank lending to firms and households.Our measures help to preserve favourable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy, which isneeded for a sustained economic recovery and for safeguarding price stability. We will also continue tomonitor developments in the exchange rate with regard to their possible implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensure thatinflation moves towards our aim in a sustained manner, in line with our commitment to symmetry.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. In the firstquarter of the year, euro area real GDP declined further, by 0.3 per cent, to stand 5.1 per cent below itspre-pandemic level of the fourth quarter of 2019. Business and consumer surveys and high-frequencyindicators point to a sizeable improvement in activity in the second quarter of this year.Business surveys indicate a strong recovery in services activity as infection numbers decline, whichwill allow a gradual normalisation of high-contact activities. Manufacturing production remains robust,supported by solid global demand, although supply-side bottlenecks could pose some headwinds for11/23/23, 3:51 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210610~115f4c0246.en.html 3/12industrial activity in the near term. Indicators of consumer confidence are strengthening, suggesting astrong rebound in private consumption in the period ahead. Business investment shows resilience,despite weaker corporate balance sheets and the still uncertain economic outlook.We expect growth to continue to improve strongly in the second half of 2021 as progress in vaccinationcampaigns allows a further relaxation of containment measures. Over the medium term, the recoveryin the euro area economy is expected to be buoyed by stronger global and domestic demand, as wellas by continued support from both monetary policy and fiscal policy.This assessment is broadly reflected in the baseline scenario of the June 2021 Eurosystem staffmacroeconomic projections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP growth at4.6 per cent in 2021, 4.7 per cent in 2022 and 2.1 per cent in 2023. Compared with the March 2021ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for economic activity has been revised up for 2021and 2022, while it is unchanged for 2023.Overall, we see the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook as broadly balanced. On the onehand, an even stronger recovery could be predicated on brighter prospects for global demand and afaster-than-anticipated reduction in household savings once social and travel restrictions have beenlifted. On the other hand, the ongoing pandemic, including the spread of virus mutations, and itsimplications for economic and financial conditions continue to be sources of downside risk.According to Eurostat\u2019s flash release, euro area annual inflation increased from 1.3 per cent in Marchto 1.6 per cent in April and 2.0 per cent in May 2021. This rise was due mainly to a strong increase inenergy price inflation, reflecting both sizeable upward base effects as well as month-on-monthincreases, and, to a lesser extent, a slight increase in non-energy industrial goods inflation. Headlineinflation is likely to increase further towards the autumn, reflecting mainly the reversal of the temporaryVAT reduction in Germany. Inflation is expected to decline again at the start of next year as temporaryfactors fade out and global energy prices moderate.We expect underlying price pressures to increase somewhat this year owing to temporary supplyconstraints and the recovery in domestic demand. Nevertheless, the price pressures will likely remainsubdued overall, in part reflecting low wage pressures, in the context of still significant economic slack,and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate.Once the impact of the pandemic fades, the unwinding of the high level of slack, supported byaccommodative monetary and fiscal policies, will contribute to a gradual increase in underlyinginflation over the medium term. Survey-based measures and market-based indicators of longer-terminflation expectations remain at subdued levels, although market-based indicators have continued toincrease.This assessment is broadly reflected in the baseline scenario of the June 2021 Eurosystem staffmacroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresees annual inflation at 1.9 per cent in 2021,1.5 per cent in 2022 and 1.4 per cent in 2023. Compared with the March 2021 ECB staffmacroeconomic projections, the outlook for inflation has been revised up for 2021 and 2022, largelyowing to temporary factors and higher energy price inflation. It is unchanged for 2023, as the increasein underlying inflation is largely counterbalanced by an expected decline in energy price inflation. HICPinflation excluding energy and food is projected to increase from 1.1 per cent in 2021 to 1.3 per cent in11/23/23, 3:51 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210610~115f4c0246.en.html 4/122022 and 1.4 per cent in 2023, revised up throughout the projection horizon compared with the March2021 projection exercise.Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of broad money (M3) declined to 9.2 percent in April 2021, from 10.0 per cent in March and 12.3 per cent in February. The deceleration inMarch and April was due partly to strong negative base effects as the large inflows in the initial phaseof the pandemic crisis dropped out of the annual growth statistics. It also reflects a moderation inshorter-term monetary dynamics, mainly originating from weaker developments in deposits byhouseholds and firms in April and lower liquidity needs as the pandemic situation improves. Theongoing asset purchases by the Eurosystem continue to be the largest source of money creation.While also decelerating, the narrow monetary aggregate M1 has remained the main contributor tobroad money growth. Its strong contribution is consistent with a still heightened preference for liquidityin the money-holding sector and a low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid forms of money.The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector declined to 3.2 per cent in April, from 3.6 per centin March and 4.5 per cent in February. This decline took place amid opposing dynamics in lending tonon-financial corporations and to households. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financialcorporations fell to 3.2 per cent in April, after 5.3 per cent in March and 7.0 per cent in February. Thecontraction reflects large negative base effects and some frontloading in loan creation in March relativeto April. The annual growth rate of loans to households rose to 3.8 per cent in April, after 3.3 per centin March and 3.0 per cent in February, supported by solid monthly flows and positive base effects.Overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments and otherEuropean institutions, remain essential to support bank lending conditions and access to financing, inparticular for those most affected by the pandemic.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary tosupport economic activity and the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to,2 per cent over the medium term.Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains crucial, as a prematurewithdrawal of fiscal support would risk weakening the recovery and amplifying the longer-term scarringeffects. National fiscal policies should thus continue to provide critical and timely support to the firmsand households most exposed to the ongoing pandemic and the associated containment measures. Atthe same time, fiscal measures should remain temporary and countercyclical, while ensuring that theyare sufficiently targeted in nature to address vulnerabilities effectively and to support a swift recovery inthe euro area economy. The three safety nets endorsed by the European Council for workers,businesses and governments provide important funding support.The Governing Council reiterates the key role of the Next Generation EU package. It calls on MemberStates to deploy the funds productively, accompanied by productivity-enhancing structural policies.This would allow the Next Generation EU programme to contribute to a faster, stronger and moreuniform recovery and would increase economic resilience as well as the growth potential of MemberStates\u2019 economies. In doing so, the programme would support the effectiveness of monetary policy inthe euro area. Such structural policies are particularly important in improving economic structures andinstitutions and in accelerating the green and digital transitions.", "26": "11/23/23, 3:51 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220609~abe7c95b19.en.html 1/12MONET ARY POLICY  STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBAmsterdam, 9 June 2022Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. I would like to thankPresident Knot for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellentorganisation of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council.High inflation is a major challenge for all of us. The Governing Council will make sure that inflationreturns to our two per cent target over the medium term.In May inflation again rose significantly, mainly because of surging energy and food prices, includingdue to the impact of the war. But inflation pressures have broadened and intensified, with prices formany goods and services increasing strongly. Eurosystem staff have revised their baseline inflationprojections up significantly. These projections indicate that inflation will remain undesirably elevated forsome time. However, moderating energy costs, the easing of supply disruptions related to thepandemic and the normalisation of monetary policy are expected to lead to a decline in inflation. Thenew staff projections foresee annual inflation at 6.8 per cent in 2022, before it is projected to decline to3.5 per cent in 2023 and 2.1 per cent in 2024 \u2013 higher than in the March projections. This means thatheadline inflation at the end of the projection horizon is projected to be slightly above our target.Inflation excluding energy and food is projected to average 3.3 per cent in 2022, 2.8 per cent in 2023and 2.3 per cent in 2024 \u2013 also above the March projections.Russia\u2019s unjustified aggression towards Ukraine continues to weigh on the economy in Europe andbeyond. It is disrupting trade, is leading to shortages of materials and is contributing to high energyand commodity prices. These factors will continue to weigh on confidence and dampen growth,especially in the near term. However, the conditions are in place for the economy to continue to growon account of the ongoing reopening of the economy, a strong labour market, fiscal support andsavings built up during the pandemic. Once current headwinds abate, economic activity is expected topick up again. This outlook is broadly reflected in the Eurosystem staff projections, which foreseeannual real GDP growth at 2.8 per cent in 2022, 2.1 per cent in 2023 and 2.1 per cent in 2024.Compared with the March projections, the outlook has been revised down significantly for 2022 and2023, while for 2024 it has been revised up.On the basis of our updated assessment, we decided to take further steps in normalising our monetarypolicy. Throughout this process, the Governing Council will maintain optionality, data-dependence,gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy.First, we decided to end net asset purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) as of 1 July2022. The Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments fromJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 3:51 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220609~abe7c95b19.en.html 2/12maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when itstarts raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain ampleliquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance.Second, we undertook a careful review of the conditions which, according to our forward guidance,should be satisfied before we start raising the key ECB interest rates. As a result of this assessment,the Governing Council concluded that those conditions have been satisfied. Accordingly, and in linewith our policy sequencing, we intend to raise the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at our Julymonetary policy meeting.Looking further ahead, we expect to raise the key ECB interest rates again in September. Thecalibration of this rate increase will depend on the updated medium-term inflation outlook. If themedium-term inflation outlook persists or deteriorates, a larger increment will be appropriate at ourSeptember meeting.Third, beyond September, based on our current assessment, we anticipate that a gradual butsustained path of further increases in interest rates will be appropriate. In line with our commitment toour two per cent medium-term target, the pace at which we adjust our monetary policy will depend onthe incoming data and how we assess inflation to develop in the medium term.Within the Governing Council\u2019s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element ofmonetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of pricestability.The decisions taken today are set out in full in a  available on our website.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing, and will thenexplain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityIn the near term, we expect activity to be dampened by high energy costs, the deterioration in theterms of trade, greater uncertainty and the adverse impact of high inflation on disposable income. Thewar in Ukraine and renewed pandemic restrictions in China have made supply bottlenecks worseagain. As a result, firms face higher costs and disruptions in their supply chains, and their outlook forfuture output has deteriorated.However, there are also factors supporting economic activity and these are expected to strengthenover the months to come. The reopening of those sectors most affected by the pandemic and a stronglabour market, with more people in jobs, will continue to support incomes and consumption. Inaddition, savings accumulated during the pandemic are a buffer.Fiscal policy is helping to cushion the impact of the war. Targeted and temporary budgetary measuresprotect those people bearing the brunt of higher energy prices while limiting the risk of adding toinflationary pressures. The swift implementation of the investment and structural reform plans underthe Next Generation EU programme, the \u201cFit for 55\u201d package and the REPowerEU plan would alsohelp the euro area economy to grow faster in a sustainable manner and become more resilient toglobal shocks.press release11/23/23, 3:51 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220609~abe7c95b19.en.html 3/12InflationInflation rose further to 8.1 per cent in May. Although governments have intervened and have helpedslow energy inflation, energy prices stand 39.2 per cent above their levels one year ago. Market-basedindicators suggest that global energy prices will stay high in the near term but will then moderate tosome extent. Food prices rose 7.5 per cent in May, in part reflecting the importance of Ukraine andRussia among the main global producers of agricultural goods.Prices have also gone up more strongly because of renewed supply bottlenecks and because ofrecovering domestic demand, especially in the services sector, as our economy reopens. Price risesare becoming more widespread across sectors. Accordingly, measures of underlying inflation havebeen rising further.The labour market continues to improve, with unemployment remaining at its historical low of 6.8 percent in April. Job vacancies across many sectors show that there is robust demand for labour. Wagegrowth, including in forward-looking indicators, has started to pick up. Over time, the strengthening ofthe economy and some catch-up effects should support faster growth in wages. While most measuresof longer-term inflation expectations derived from financial markets and from expert surveys stand ataround two per cent, initial signs of above-target revisions in those measures warrant close monitoring.Risk assessmentRisks relating to the pandemic have declined but the war continues to be a significant downside risk togrowth. In particular, a major risk would be a further disruption in the energy supply to the euro area,as reflected in the downside scenario included in the staff projections. Furthermore, if the war were toescalate, economic sentiment could worsen, supply-side constraints could increase, and energy andfood costs could remain persistently higher than expected.The risks surrounding inflation are primarily on the upside. The risks to the medium-term inflationoutlook include a durable worsening of the production capacity of our economy, persistently highenergy and food prices, inflation expectations rising above our target and higher than anticipated wagerises. However, if demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressures on prices.Financial and monetary conditionsMarket interest rates have increased in response to the changing outlook for inflation and monetarypolicy. With benchmark interest rates rising, bank funding costs have increased, and this has fed intohigher bank lending rates in particular for households. Nevertheless, lending to firms picked up inMarch. This was because of the continued need to finance investment and working capital, against thebackdrop of increasing production costs, persisting supply bottlenecks and lower reliance on marketfunding. Lending to households also increased, reflecting continued robust demand for mortgages.In line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council has undertaken its biannual in-depthassessment of the interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability. The environment forfinancial stability has worsened since our last review in December 2021, especially over the shortterm. In particular, lower growth and increasing cost pressures, as well as rising risk-free rates andsovereign bond yields, could lead to a further deterioration in the financing conditions faced by11/23/23, 3:51 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220609~abe7c95b19.en.html 4/12borrowers. At the same time, tighter financing conditions could reduce some existing financial stabilityvulnerabilities over the medium term. Banks, which started the year with solid capital positions andimproving asset quality, are now facing greater credit risk. We will watch these factors closely. In anycase, macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence in preserving financial stability andaddressing medium-term vulnerabilities.ConclusionSumming up, Russia\u2019s unjustified aggression towards Ukraine is severely affecting the euro areaeconomy and the outlook is still surrounded by high uncertainty. But the conditions are in place for theeconomy to continue to grow and to recover further over the medium term.Inflation is undesirably high and is expected to remain above our target for some time. We will makesure that inflation returns to our two per cent target over the medium term. Accordingly, we decided totake further steps in normalising our monetary policy. The calibration of our policies will remain data-dependent and reflect our evolving assessment of the outlook. We stand ready to adjust all of ourinstruments within our mandate, incorporating flexibility if warranted, to ensure that inflation stabilisesat our two per cent target over the medium term.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *I have two questions. Firstly, one argument that you've made rather frequently over the last fewmonths is that the euro area economy is in a very different place than other advancedeconomies. Even so, three months after the Fed started raising interest rates, you are nowlooking to start doing the same. So, is this still about a difference, or are we talking more abouta delay at this point?Second of all: could you tell us a little bit about whether this week's discussion focussed at allon fragmentation risks, and whether there were any new proposals made to address them?The Governing Council, on the occasion of this meeting organised outside of Frankfurt, in beautifulAmsterdam \u2013 thanks to the National Central Bank of the Netherlands \u2013 focussed primarily on thechallenge of high inflation facing the euro area, and on taking further steps in our normalisation paththat we started back in December. So it's not a question of catching up; it's a question of using all thetools that we have in order to deliver on our mandate of price stability and in order to bring inflationdown to target over the medium term. Our analysis was obviously that inflation was undesirably highand that we had to take the steps that I have identified in the monetary policy statement.I would like to add that it's not just a step; it's a journey. We started back in December. We graduallyover the course of time put ourselves in a position to move away from unconventional monetary policy,which will actually be taking place as of 1 July, in order to use more conventional tools which are theinterest rates. On the issue of the interest rates: we also identified a path, which is not only limited to aparticular move, but a series of moves over the course of the next few months depending on themedium-term outlook of inflation.On the second issue: we have to have the right monetary policy stance; that is critically important andthat is what we are doing with that identification of the journey that I just mentioned. But we also have", "27": "11/23/23, 3:49 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230615~3de9d68335.en.html 1/10MONET ARY POLICY  STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 15 June 2023Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.Inflation has been coming down but is projected to remain too high for too long. We are determined toensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. The GoverningCouncil therefore today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points.The rate increase today reflects our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics ofunderlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. According to the Junemacroeconomic projections, Eurosystem staff expect headline inflation to average 5.4 per cent in2023, 3.0 per cent in 2024 and 2.2 per cent in 2025. Indicators of underlying price pressures remainstrong, although some show tentative signs of softening. Staff have revised up their projections forinflation excluding energy and food, especially for this year and next year, owing to past upwardsurprises and the implications of the robust labour market for the speed of disinflation. They now see itreaching 5.1 per cent in 2023, before it declines to 3.0 per cent in 2024 and 2.3 per cent in 2025. Staffhave slightly lowered their economic growth projections for this year and next year. They now expectthe economy to grow by 0.9 per cent in 2023, 1.5 per cent in 2024 and 1.6 per cent in 2025.At the same time, our past rate increases are being transmitted forcefully to financing conditions andare gradually having an impact across the economy. Borrowing costs have increased steeply andgrowth in loans is slowing. Tighter financing conditions are a key reason why inflation is projected todecline further towards our target, as they are expected to increasingly dampen demand.Our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be brought to levels sufficientlyrestrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target and will be keptat those levels for as long as necessary. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach todetermining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisionswill continue to be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economicand financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policytransmission.The Governing Council confirms that it will discontinue the reinvestments under the asset purchaseprogramme as of July 2023.The decisions taken today are set out in a  available on our website.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explainour assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Jump to the transcript of the questions and answerspress release11/23/23, 3:49 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230615~3de9d68335.en.html 2/10Economic activityThe euro area economy has stagnated in recent months. As in the fourth quarter of last year, it shrankby 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, amid a drop in private and public consumption. Economicgrowth is likely to remain weak in the short run but strengthen in the course of the year, as inflationcomes down and supply disruptions continue to ease. Conditions in different sectors of the economyare uneven: manufacturing continues to weaken, partly owing to lower global demand and tighter euroarea financing conditions, while services remain resilient.The labour market remains a source of strength. Almost a million new jobs were added in the firstquarter of the year and the unemployment rate stood at its historical low of 6.5 per cent in April. Theaverage number of hours worked has also increased, although it is still somewhat below its pre-pandemic level.As the energy crisis fades, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and ina concerted manner to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for astronger monetary policy response. Fiscal policies should be designed to make our economy moreproductive and gradually bring down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area\u2019s supplycapacity, especially in the energy sector, can also help reduce price pressures in the medium term.The reform of the EU\u2019s economic governance framework should be concluded soon.InflationInflation fell further to 6.1 per cent in May, according to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, from 7.0 per cent inApril. The decline was broad-based. Energy price inflation, which had risen in April, resumed itsdownward trend and was negative in May. Food price inflation fell again but remained high at 12.5 percent.Inflation excluding energy and food declined in May for the second month in a row, to 5.3 per cent from5.6 per cent in April. Goods inflation decreased further, to 5.8 per cent from 6.2 per cent in April.Services inflation fell for the first time in several months, from 5.2 per cent to 5.0 per cent. Indicators ofunderlying price pressures remain strong, although some show tentative signs of softening.Past increases in energy costs are still pushing up prices across the economy. Pent-up demand fromthe reopening of the economy also continues to drive up inflation, especially in services. Wagepressures, while partly reflecting one-off payments, are becoming an increasingly important source ofinflation. Compensation per employee rose by 5.2 per cent in the first quarter of the year andnegotiated wages by 4.3 per cent. Moreover, firms in some sectors have been able to keep profitsrelatively high, especially where demand has outstripped supply. Although most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around 2 per cent, some indicators remain elevated andneed to be monitored closely.Risk assessmentThe outlook for economic growth and inflation remains highly uncertain. Downside risks to growthinclude Russia\u2019s unjustified war against Ukraine and an increase in broader geopolitical tensions,which could fragment global trade and thus weigh on the euro area economy. Growth could also be11/23/23, 3:49 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230615~3de9d68335.en.html 3/10slower if the effects of monetary policy are more forceful than projected. Renewed financial markettensions could lead to even tighter financing conditions than anticipated and weaken confidence. Also,weaker growth in the world economy could further dampen economic activity in the euro area.However, growth could be higher than projected if the strong labour market and receding uncertaintymean that people and businesses become more confident and spend more. Upside risks to inflation include potential renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food,also related to Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. A lasting rise in inflation expectations above our target, orhigher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, includingover the medium term. Recent wage agreements in a number of countries have added to the upsiderisks to inflation. By contrast, renewed financial market tensions could bring inflation down faster thanprojected. Weaker demand, for example due to a stronger transmission of monetary policy, would alsolead to lower price pressures, especially over the medium term. Moreover, inflation would come downfaster if declining energy prices and lower food price increases were to pass through to other goodsand services more quickly than currently anticipated.Financial and monetary conditionsOur monetary policy tightening continues to be reflected in risk-free interest rates and broaderfinancing conditions. Funding conditions are tighter for banks and credit is becoming more expensivefor firms and households. In April lending rates reached their highest level in more than a decade,standing at 4.4 per cent for business loans and 3.4 per cent for mortgages.These higher borrowing rates, together with tighter credit supply conditions and lower loan demand,have further weakened credit dynamics. The annual growth of loans to firms declined again in April, to4.6 per cent. The month-on-month changes have been negative on average since November. Loans tohouseholds grew at an annual rate of 2.5 per cent in April and increased only marginally month onmonth. Weak bank lending and the reduction in the Eurosystem balance sheet led to a continueddecline in annual broad money growth to 1.9 per cent in April. Month-on-month changes in broadmoney have been negative since December.In line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council thoroughly assessed the links betweenmonetary policy and financial stability. The financial stability outlook has remained challenging sinceour last review in December 2022. Tighter financing conditions are raising banks\u2019 funding costs and thecredit risk of outstanding loans. Together with the recent tensions in the US banking system, thesefactors could give rise to systemic stress and depress economic growth in the short term. Anotherfactor weighing on the resilience of the financial sector is a downturn in the real estate markets, whichcould be amplified by higher borrowing costs and a rise in unemployment. At the same time, euro areabanks have strong capital and liquidity positions, which mitigate these financial stability risks.Macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities.ConclusionInflation has been coming down but is projected to remain too high for too long.

In the press conferenceyou said there's more ground to cover and the ECB is not pausing. My first question is that, ifyou have a similar guidance, are you willing to make the same comment in the pressconference today? The second is, what lessons do you draw from the Fed's pause? I don'tmean that you need to emulate the Fed; clearly, the ECB has its own policy. But I mean thereasons behind the pause, as quite a lot has been done. There needs to be an evaluation of theeffects of policy tightening. So, do you see a reason for the ECB to contemplate a similarpause? Is there a risk that focussing on past projection errors could increase the risk of apolicy error by the ECB?On your first question, this meeting was the meeting of a Eurosystem projection exercise. So, we havelooked very much at data. We have revised our projection. We essentially did what we said we woulddo: data dependent and using the three elements of our reaction function to determine what was theright decision today. That is the reason why we increased all three rates by 25 basis points. Are wedone? Have we finished the journey? No, we're not at destination. Do we still have ground to cover?Yes, we have ground to cover. I can even go further than that: I can tell you that, barring a materialchange to our baseline, it is very likely the case that we will continue to increase rates in July, whichprobably doesn't come as a big surprise to you, but that's what I'm telling you. And this is so becausewe are determined to reach our target in a timely manner, and to continue to apply the principles thatwe have applied today: data dependency, the three elements of the reaction function, and movingmeeting by meeting. Obviously, we are better informed at each projection meeting which happens, asyou know, in June, in September and later.To your second question: I don't know what difference to make between a pause and a skip. I have notstudied enough the press conference of my friend and colleague, Mr Powell. But as far as the ECB isconcerned, I said what I said: we have hiked interest rates. Unless there was a material change to ourbaseline, we will continue to hike at our next meeting. So, we are not thinking about pausing, as youcan tell.", "28": "11/23/23, 3:54 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180308.en.html 1/11PRESS CONFERENCEMario Draghi, President of the ECB,V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, Vice-Presidentof the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 8 March 2018Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interestrates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended periodof time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases.Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that our net asset purchases, atthe current monthly pace of \u20ac30 billion, are intended to run until the end of September 2018, orbeyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in thepath of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The Eurosystem will continue to reinvest the principalpayments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extendedperiod of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary. Thiswill contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance.Incoming information, including our new staff projections, confirms the strong and broad-based growthmomentum in the euro area economy, which is projected to expand in the near term at a somewhatfaster pace than previously expected. This outlook for growth confirms our confidence that inflation willconverge towards our inflation aim of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At the same time,measures of underlying inflation remain subdued and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustainedupward trend. In this context, the Governing Council will continue to monitor developments in theexchange rate and financial conditions with regard to their possible implications for the inflationoutlook. Overall, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflationpressures to continue to build up and support headline inflation developments over the medium term.This continued monetary support is provided by the net asset purchases, by the sizeable stock ofacquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and by our forward guidance on interest rates.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDPincreased by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2017, after increasing by 0.7% in thethird quarter. The latest economic data and survey results indicate continued strong and broad-basedgrowth momentum. Our monetary policy measures, which have facilitated the deleveraging process,continue to underpin domestic demand. Private consumption is supported by rising employment, whichis also benefiting from past labour market reforms, and by growing household wealth. Businessinvestment continues to strengthen on the back of very favourable financing conditions, risingcorporate profitability and solid demand. Housing investment has improved further over recentquarters. In addition, the broad-based global expansion is providing impetus to euro area exports.This assessment is broadly reflected in the March 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for theeuro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 2.4% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019 andJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 3:54 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180308.en.html 2/111.7% in 2020. Compared with the December 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, theoutlook for real GDP growth has been revised up for 2018 and remains unchanged for 2019 and 2020.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are assessed as broadly balanced. On the onehand, the prevailing positive cyclical momentum could lead to stronger growth in the near term. On theother hand, downside risks continue to relate primarily to global factors, including rising protectionismand developments in foreign exchange and other financial markets.According to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation decreased to 1.2% in February2018, from 1.3% in January. This reflected mainly negative base effects in unprocessed food priceinflation. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflationare likely to hover around 1.5% for the remainder of the year. Measures of underlying inflation remainsubdued overall. Looking forward, they are expected to rise gradually over the medium term,supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the correspondingabsorption of economic slack and rising wage growth.This assessment is also broadly reflected in the March 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections forthe euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.4% in 2018, 1.4% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020.Compared with the December 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook forheadline HICP inflation has been revised down slightly for 2019 and remains unchanged for 2018 and2020.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with anannual rate of growth of 4.6% in January 2018, unchanged from the previous month, reflecting theimpact of the ECB\u2019s monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquiddeposits. Accordingly, the narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broadmoney growth, continuing to expand at a solid annual rate.The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 isprogressing. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations strengthened to 3.4% inJanuary 2018, after 3.1% in December 2017, while the annual growth rate of loans to householdsremained unchanged at 2.9%. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place sinceJune 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access tofinancing \u2012 notably for small and medium-sized enterprises \u2012 and credit flows across the euro area.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed the need for an ample degree of monetary accommodation to secure asustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the mediumterm.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contributedecisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementationof structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increaseresilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential.Against the background of overall limited implementation of the 2017 country-specificrecommendations, as communicated by the European Commission yesterday, greater reform effort isnecessary in the euro area countries. Regarding fiscal policies, the increasingly solid and broad-11/23/23, 3:54 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180308.en.html 3/11based expansion calls for rebuilding fiscal buffers. This is particularly important in countries wheregovernment debt remains high. All countries would benefit from intensifying efforts towards achieving amore growth-friendly composition of public finances. A full, transparent and consistent implementationof the Stability and Growth Pact and of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure over time and acrosscountries remains essential to increase the resilience of the euro area economy. Deepening Economicand Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council urges specific and decisive steps tocomplete the banking union and the capital markets union.We are now at your disposal for questions.* * *I notice that you have changed somewhat your monetary policy statement, dropping thecommitment to increase the size of quantitative easing, if necessary. Could you explain thereasons for that, especially against the backdrop of trade war talks that we have been hearingand somewhat slowing down of survey indicators for the recovery?Second question on Latvia, on the affairs surrounding Mr Rimsevics, a Governing Councilmember. Do you see the fact that Latvian authorities are effectively blocking a GoverningCouncil member from attending Governing Council meetings as an infringement of centralbank independence? If not, why not?Also do you feel the Latvian authorities have been not fully cooperating with the ECB on thisaffair?Draghi: First of all, the first question: let me just read to you the sentence we have removed. By theway, it was a sentence introduced in 2016, when we cut our monthly purchases from \u20ac80 to \u20ac60 billion.Thinking about that, you can just figure out, how different the situation was at that time. The sentencesays: if the outlook becomes less favourable or if financial conditions become inconsistent with furtherprogress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase the assetpurchase programme in terms of size and/or duration. So, what we did was to remove the explicitreference to the likelihood of an increase in the pace of purchases in the near future.We shouldn't forget that we have kept the other reference to such a possibility when it says: theEurosystem will continue to reinvest the principal payments for an extended period of time after theend of net asset purchases and in any case for as long as necessary. All in all, if you read this decision\u2013 by the way the decision was unanimous \u2013 that's what it is. It's substantially a backward-lookingdecision without signals or implications for either our expectations or our reaction function. We stillexpect the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time andwell past the horizon of our net asset purchases. It also hasn't changed our reaction function. Weconfirm that our net asset purchases at the current monthly pace of \u20ac30 billion are intended to run untilthe end of September 2018, or beyond if necessary \u2013 and in any case until the Governing Councilsees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. That's what thedecision is and that's what it is. And it was unanimous, as I said.Now, if I may elaborate on the second question about Latvia. Well, on Latvia we really don't haveenough information. That's why today we are sending a letter to the European Court of Justice. TheGoverning Council has decided, again unanimously, to ask for clarification by the Court of Justice of11/23/23, 3:54 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180308.en.html 4/11the European Union whether individual security measures imposed on the Governor of Latvijas Bankaby the Latvian Anti-Corruption Authority on 19 February 2018, have had the effect of relieving him fromoffice and they comply with Union law, in particular with Article 14.2 of the Statute. We are asking theECJ for a clarification on the present situation.You mentioned that the removal of the pledge to increase quantitative easing was unanimous.In the run-up to that unanimous decision, did any policymaker call for a more radical change,perhaps dropping a link between the APP and inflation or taking out the option to extend theduration of the APP?The second question is on trade: could the US administration's planned tariffs by hurting theeurozone's economy slow down the return of inflation to the ECB's target?Draghi: Well, on the first question, as I said, it was a unanimous decision and there wasn't muchdiscussion about other possible changes in monetary policy for the coming months. Just so that I cangive you a sketchy summary of the discussion, it was a kind of a fairly, in a sense, usual blend ofconfidence, persistence and patience. Of confidence \u2013 because the latest incoming data on growthreduced the variance of the path of inflation converging to our inflation aim. But also persistence andpatience \u2013 and here of course you have different views, some people are more confident, some peopleare less confident and therefore they stress the persistence and patience. There was a somewhatrepeated reference to the uncertainty surrounding potential output growth path.The reason for that is that first of all, we discussed several times about how complex themeasurements of unemployment are. But also there is a fact that strong growth may produce strongerpotential output growth as well. If you look at the past structural reforms, the increases in laboursupply, the increase in participation rates, the increase in productivity, basically all this increases theuncertainty about the potential output growth path and therefore about the size of the slack in theeconomy. So, the policy will continue to be reactive, basically. These are some parts of our discussion.Another part was devoted to assessing the progress of \u2013 well, the possible progress we've made \u2013about inflation, where we said that basically, inflation, headline inflation, will hover around 1.5% for theremaining part of the year. The underlying inflation measures remain subdued. Even though we havestrong growth, we still have subdued inflation and our mandate is in terms of price stability, so victorycannot be declared yet.Finally, you asked about monetary policy. The exchange was about emphasising all the pillars of ourmonetary policy. We have the flows of net purchases. We have the stock that it is accumulating. Wehave the reinvestment policy for an extended period of time, as I've just read. Especially we have theforward guidance on interest rate path, and they were all important.I am sorry, you also asked the question about trade. The immediate spill-over impact of the trademeasures, just if you have a static estimate, it's not going to be big. But what strikes me is thatwhatever convictions one has about trade, we \u2013 and certainly the Governing Council is on this line \u2013we are convinced that disputes should be discussed and resolved in a multilateral framework, thatunilateral decisions are dangerous. Also there is a certain, I would say, worry or concern about thestate of international relations, because if you put tariffs against your allies, one wonders who theenemies are. I think these are two general considerations that are quite relevant.", "29": "11/23/23, 4:19 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190307~de1fdbd0b0.en.html 1/12INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEMario Draghi, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-Presidentof the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 7 March 2019Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council, whichwas also attended by the Commission Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have conducted a thorough assessmentof the economic and inflation outlook, also taking into account the latest staff macroeconomicprojections for the euro area. As a result, the Governing Council took the following decisions in thepursuit of its price stability objective.First, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We now expect them to remain attheir present levels at least through the end of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary toensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% overthe medium term.Second, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date whenwe start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintainfavourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.Third, we decided to launch a new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations(TLTRO-III), starting in September 2019 and ending in March 2021, each with a maturity of two years.These new operations will help to preserve favourable bank lending conditions and the smoothtransmission of monetary policy. Under TLTRO-III, counterparties will be entitled to borrow up to 30%of the stock of eligible loans as at 28 February 2019 at a rate indexed to the interest rate on the mainrefinancing operations over the life of each operation. Like the outstanding TLTRO programme,TLTRO \u2011 III will feature built-in incentives for credit conditions to remain favourable. Further details onthe precise terms of TLTRO-III will be communicated in due course.Fourth, we will continue conducting our lending operations as fixed rate tender procedures with fullallotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the reserve maintenance periodstarting in March 2021.Today\u2019s monetary policy decisions were taken to ensure that inflation remains on a sustained pathtowards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. While there are signs that someof the idiosyncratic domestic factors dampening growth are starting to fade, the weakening ineconomic data points to a sizeable moderation in the pace of the economic expansion that will extendinto the current year. The persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat ofprotectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets appears to be leaving marks on economicJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:19 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190307~de1fdbd0b0.en.html 2/12sentiment. Moreover, underlying inflation continues to be muted. The weaker economic momentum isslowing the adjustment of inflation towards our aim. At the same time, supportive financing conditions,favourable labour market dynamics and rising wage growth continue to underpin the euro areaexpansion and gradually rising inflation pressures. Today\u2019s decisions will support the further build-up ofdomestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. Significantmonetary policy stimulus will continue to be provided by our forward guidance on the key ECB interestrates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series ofTLTROs. In any event, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, asappropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council\u2019s inflation aim ina sustained manner.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro areareal GDP increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2018, following growth of 0.1%in the third quarter. Incoming data have continued to be weak, in particular in the manufacturing sector,reflecting the slowdown in external demand compounded by some country and sector-specific factors.The impact of these factors is turning out to be somewhat longer-lasting, which suggests that the near-term growth outlook will be weaker than previously anticipated. Looking ahead, the effect of theseadverse factors is expected to unwind. The euro area expansion will continue to be supported byfavourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, and the ongoing \u2013 albeitsomewhat slower \u2013 expansion in global activity.This assessment is broadly reflected in the March 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for theeuro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.1% in 2019, 1.6% in 2020 and1.5% in 2021. Compared with the December 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, theoutlook for real GDP growth has been revised down substantially in 2019 and slightly in 2020.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are still tilted to the downside, on account of thepersistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism andvulnerabilities in emerging markets.According to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.5% in February 2019,after 1.4% in January, reflecting somewhat higher energy and food price inflation. On the basis ofcurrent futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to remain at around current levels beforedeclining towards the end of year. Measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, but labourcost pressures have strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation andtightening labour markets. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over themedium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion andrising wage growth.This assessment is also broadly reflected in the March 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections forthe euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.2% in 2019, 1.5% in 2020 and 1.6% in 2021.Compared with the December 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook forHICP inflation has been revised down across the projection horizon, reflecting in particular the moresubdued near-term growth outlook.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth decreased to 3.8% in January 2019,from 4.1% in December 2018. M3 growth continues to be backed by bank credit creation,11/23/23, 4:19 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190307~de1fdbd0b0.en.html 3/12notwithstanding a recent moderation in credit dynamics. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remainedthe main contributor to broad money growth.The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations declined to 3.3% in January 2019, from3.9% in December 2018, reflecting a base effect but also, in some countries, the typical laggedreaction to the slowdown in economic activity, while the annual growth rate of loans to householdsremained at 3.2%. Borrowing conditions for firms and households are still favourable, as the monetarypolicy measures put in place since June 2014 continue to support access to financing, in particular forsmall and medium-sized enterprises. The policy measures decided today, and in particular the newseries of TLTROs, will help to ensure that bank lending conditions remain favourable going forward.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary forthe continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over themedium term.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contributemore decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. Theimplementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up toincrease resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growthpotential. This is particularly important in view of the overall limited implementation of the 2018country-specific recommendations, as recently communicated by the European Commission.Regarding fiscal policies, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the operation ofautomatic stabilisers are providing support to economic activity. At the same time, countries wheregovernment debt is high need to continue rebuilding fiscal buffers. All countries should continue toincrease efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. Likewise, thetransparent and consistent implementation of the European Union\u2019s fiscal and economic governanceframework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro areaeconomy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. TheGoverning Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps tocomplete the banking union and the capital markets union.We are now at your disposal for questions.* * *Mr President, could you give us an idea about the reasons why you decided on the specificfeatures of the TLTRO-III programme? For example why are the maturities two years? Why haveyou indexed it to the MRO, and also why is the start date in September when the fundingbecomes relevant for banks' Net Stable Funding Ratios in June already.My second question is what you would like to achieve with this programme, so are you tryingto keep the size of the balance sheet stable? Or are you trying to add extra accommodation?Draghi: The design of the TLTRO responds to a variety of objectives. The key objective derives fromhow the situation of bank funding looks like over the next few years. In the coming years we will have acongestion for bank funding caused by the coming to maturity of the existing TLTROs, the coming tomaturity of sizable amounts of bank bonds, various regulatory compliances. The TLTROs, as has been11/23/23, 4:19 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190307~de1fdbd0b0.en.html 4/12said in the introductory statement, maintain [and] preserve favourable bank lending conditions and asmooth transition of monetary policy. Now, the precise design, whether it's two instead of four, doreflect the changed conditions we have today. Now, further details especially on the pricing and otherdetails, will get to be known in due time.Now, the second question really addresses the substance of today's meeting so let me give you abroad account of how this meeting unfolded. In so doing, I think I'm pretty sure I'll respond to some ofthe questions you intend to ask. First of all, the decisions: It's four sets of decisions. We moved thecalendar-based part of our forward guidance from September to December. The second, we confirmthe reinvestment in full of the principle payments from maturing securities. Now, you understand theimportance of the chained element in our monetary policy. Having moved the calendar-based, so doesthe expected \u2013 well, whatever the horizon is going to be during which the purchases will take place tokeep the stock unchanged, so you see this is adding accommodation.To answer your question, as a matter of fact you asked me is this adding accommodation? Thefinancing conditions have been \u2013 well, monetary policy has been very accommodative, but alsofinancing conditions as a matter of fact have even eased since our last meeting. This is also partly dueto the structure of our forward guidance so that expected interest rates have gone down since the lastmeeting and especially at the end of last year as well. Then the third element is the targeted longer-term refinancing operations that we've just discussed. Then we have the fixed-rate tender procedureswith full allotment for as long as necessary, at least until the end of the reserve maintenance periodstarting in March 2021.Now, what are the features of all these measures? First of all, they are data-driven. These aredecisions that have been taken following a significant downward revision of the forecasts by our staff.Second, you've seen and you've just heard me say that optionality is reiterated in all instances, whichmeans that the Governing Council is both willing and committed to act when if needed, amplifying theuse of these instruments based on the data. Third is what I just said; all this takes place in anenvironment where monetary policy accommodation is already very substantial.Second point is, how did we get to take these decisions? The answer here is that they wereunanimous. There was unanimity and I think given the complexity of the package, I think it's a very,very positive sign for the cohesiveness of the Governing Council and of our deliberations. Third, whatis the general context in which these decisions have taken place? Well, we're coming \u2013 and maybe westill are \u2013 in a period of continued weakness and pervasive uncertainty. That's why the forecast hasbeen revised downwards quite significantly. Now, I will come and comment in a moment about thepervasive uncertainty but the factors that have originally caused this weakness, which are mostly ofexternal source, are still there. The uncertainty is partly related to how long these factors will continueaffecting the world economy, the eurozone economy and confidence more generally.There are two observations to make about the assessment of the outlook. First, the Governing Councilexpressed confidence, all members expressed confidence in the baseline, which means that weassess the probabilities of a recession as being very low, as well as the probabilities of a de-anchoringof inflation expectations are indeed very low in our assessment. What are the reasons? Well, thereasons are the same that underpinned the strength of our economy in our previous meetings; namelynominal wage growth continues, labour market, though at a kind of slower rate but continues to", "30": "11/23/23, 3:57 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200312~f857a21b6c.en.html 1/11INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 12 March 2020Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council, whichwas also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.Since our last Governing Council meeting in late January, the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19)has been a major shock to the growth prospects of the global and euro area economies and hasheightened market volatility. Even if ultimately temporary in nature, it will have a significant impact oneconomic activity. In particular, it will slow down production as a result of disrupted supply chains andreduce domestic and foreign demand, especially through the adverse impact of the necessarycontainment measures. In addition, the heightened uncertainty negatively affects expenditure plansand their financing.Governments and all other policy institutions are called upon to take timely and targeted actions toaddress the public health challenge of containing the spread of the coronavirus and mitigate itseconomic impact. In particular, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal policy response is required tosupport businesses and workers at risk. The Governing Council strongly supports the commitment ofeuro area governments and the European Institutions to joint and coordinated policy action inresponse to the repercussions of the spread of the coronavirus. We also welcome the decisions takenby the ECB\u2019s Supervisory Board, which are detailed in a separate press release published earliertoday.In line with our mandate, the Governing Council is determined to support households and firms in theface of the current economic disruptions and heightened uncertainty. Accordingly, we decided on acomprehensive package of monetary policy measures. Together with the substantial monetary policystimulus already in place, these measures will support liquidity and funding conditions for households,businesses and banks and will help to preserve the smooth provision of credit to the real economy.First, we decided to conduct, temporarily, additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) toprovide immediate liquidity support to the euro area financial system. Although we do not see materialsigns of strains in money markets or liquidity shortages in the banking system, these operations willprovide an effective backstop in case of need. They will be carried out through a fixed rate tenderprocedure with full allotment, with an interest rate that is equal to the average rate on the depositfacility. The LTROs will provide liquidity at favourable terms to bridge the period until the TLTRO IIIoperation in June 2020.Second, the Governing Council decided to apply considerably more favourable terms during the periodfrom June 2020 to June 2021 to all TLTRO III operations outstanding during that same time. TheseJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 3:57 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200312~f857a21b6c.en.html 2/11operations will support bank lending to those affected most by the spread of the coronavirus, inparticular small and medium-sized enterprises. Throughout this period, the interest rate on theseTLTRO III operations will be 25 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem\u2019s mainrefinancing operations. For counterparties that maintain their levels of credit provision, the rate appliedin these operations will be lower, and, over the period ending in June 2021, can be as low as 25 basispoints below the average interest rate on the deposit facility. Moreover, the maximum total amount thatcounterparties will henceforth be entitled to borrow in TLTRO III operations is raised to 50% of theirstock of eligible loans as at 28 February 2019. In this context, the Governing Council will mandate theEurosystem committees to investigate collateral easing measures to ensure that counterpartiescontinue to be able to make full use of our funding support.Third, we decided to add a temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases of \u20ac120 billion untilthe end of the year, ensuring a strong contribution from the private sector purchase programmes. Incombination with the existing asset purchase programme (APP), this will support favourable financingconditions for the real economy in times of heightened uncertainty. We continue to expect net assetpurchases to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates,and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates.In addition, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expectthem to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustlyconverge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and suchconvergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the keyECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditionsand an ample degree of monetary accommodation.Further details on the precise terms of our new operations will be published in dedicated pressreleases this afternoon at 15:30 CET.In view of current developments, the Governing Council will continue to monitor closely theimplications of the spread of the coronavirus for the economy, for medium-term inflation and for thetransmission of its monetary policy. The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments,as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with itscommitment to symmetry.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latestindicators suggest a considerable worsening of the near-term growth outlook. The disruption of supplychains is impeding production plans in the manufacturing sector, while necessary containmentmeasures against the further spread of the coronavirus are adversely affecting economic activity.Before the coronavirus outbreak, euro area real GDP growth moderated to 0.1%, quarter on quarter, inthe fourth quarter of 2019, following growth of 0.3% in the third quarter. This mainly reflected theongoing weakness in the euro area manufacturing sector and slowing investment growth. Lookingbeyond the disruption stemming from the coronavirus, euro area growth is expected to regain tractionover the medium term, supported by favourable financing conditions, the euro area fiscal stance andthe expected resumption in global activity.11/23/23, 3:57 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200312~f857a21b6c.en.html 3/11This assessment is only partly reflected in the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections forthe euro area, as their data cut-off date predates the most recent rapid spread of the coronavirus to theeuro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 0.8% in 2020, 1.3% in 2021 and1.4% in 2022. In particular, the projections foresee very muted growth in the first half of 2020, followedby an improvement in the second half of the year. Compared with the December 2019 Eurosystemstaff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised down notably for2020 and slightly for 2021, on account of the potential economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are clearly on the downside. In addition to thepreviously identified risks related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities inemerging markets, the spread of the coronavirus adds a new and substantial source of downside riskto the growth outlook.According to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation decreased to 1.2% in February2020, from 1.4% in January. On the basis of the sharp decline in current and futures prices for oil,headline inflation is likely to decline considerably over the coming months. Indicators of inflationexpectations have fallen and measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted. While labourcost pressures have so far remained resilient amid tighter labour markets, the weaker growthmomentum is delaying their pass-through to inflation. Over the medium term, the increase in inflationwill be supported by our monetary policy measures and the recovery in euro area growth dynamics.This assessment is only partly reflected in the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections forthe euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.1% in 2020, 1.4% in 2021 and 1.6% in 2022.Compared with the December 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook forHICP inflation is broadly unrevised over the projection horizon. The implications of the coronavirus forinflation are surrounded by high uncertainty, given that downward pressures linked to weaker demandmay be offset by upward pressures related to supply disruptions. The recent sharp decline in oil pricesposes significant downside risks to the short-term inflation outlook.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth stood at 5.2% in January 2020, havingmoderated somewhat from its recent peak. Money growth continues to reflect ongoing bank creditcreation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3 relative to other financialinstruments. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continues to be the main contributor to broad moneygrowth.Loans to the private sector continued to expand. The annual growth rate of loans to households pickedup somewhat to 3.7% in January 2020, from 3.6% in December 2019. The annual growth rate of loansto non-financial corporations remained unchanged at 3.2% in January, confirming the moderation seensince autumn 2019 and likely reflecting the typically lagged reaction to the past weakening in theeconomy. Overall, our accommodative monetary policy stance, including the measures taken today,will safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing,including for those affected most by the ramifications of the coronavirus and, in particular, for small andmedium-sized enterprises.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary for therobust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.11/23/23, 3:57 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200312~f857a21b6c.en.html 4/11Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance is now needed in view of theweakened outlook and to safeguard against the further materialisation of downside risks. We welcomethe measures already taken by several governments to ensure sufficient health sector resources andto provide support to affected companies and employees. In particular, measures such as providingcredit guarantees are needed to complement and reinforce the monetary policy measures taken today.We welcome the commitment of the euro area governments and the European Institutions to act now,strongly, and together in response to the repercussions of the further spread of the coronavirus.Before we take your questions, we would like to express our profound gratitude to all those who arededicating their time and efforts in saving lives and containing the spread of the coronavirus.* * *My first question would be about the rationale for not cutting interest rates today. Could yougive us the reason why there was no rate cut today? Is it because there was not enoughsupport for such a move within the Governing Council, or maybe you all considered this iscounterproductive? That's my first question.Another question is about the issue you mentioned as the last, which is this extra envelope ofQE. Have you also discussed this part of adding that envelope, change your issue and issuerlimits of the current programme, and also, will the decisions change anything with regards tothe orientation of the APP towards meeting the capital key?President Lagarde: I would, first of all, like to indicate to you that we very much operated in the samesetting at the Governing Council of the ECB. In other words, some members were in the room, othermembers were online and participated fully to the discussions. We innovated. We had a goodoutcome, so much so that we actually had a unanimous decision on the various elements of thepackage that I have announced to you earlier on. So, this unanimous decision that was reached todaywas clearly determined by the fact that we believe that we have the most efficient, best targeted andmost focused set of tools to address the kind of risks that we are facing under the currentcircumstances. So, if we are to compare one instrument versus the other we certainly considered alltogether that the use of this additional \u20ac120 billion asset purchase programme on the top of pre-existing programmes was the most efficient response to the market excess sensitivities that we see atthe moment. That's question one.Your second question had to do with how we are going to organise this asset purchase programme. Ican assure you on that page that first of all we will make use of all the flexibilities that are embedded inthe framework of the asset purchase programme, and that, second, at the end of the asset purchaseprogramme we will converge towards the capital keys.A question on the economy with the risks pointed clearly to the downside. Can the euro zoneavoid a recession this year?What will happen with the strategy review; will it be postponed or put on hold, given that youcan't even hold public hearings?President Lagarde: I think it is clear to all of us that the economies of the world, and certainly theeconomies of the euro area are facing a major shock. I think the response to your question will clearlydepend on the speed, the strength and the collective approach that will be taken by all players, and as", "31": "11/23/23, 4:16 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210311~d368d7151a.en.html 1/12INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 11 March 2021Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of the meeting of the Governing Council, which wasalso attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.While the overall economic situation is expected to improve over 2021, there remains uncertaintysurrounding the near-term economic outlook, relating in particular to the dynamics of the pandemicand the speed of vaccination campaigns. The rebound in global demand and additional fiscalmeasures are supporting global and euro area activity. But persistently high rates of coronavirus(COVID-19) infection, the spread of virus mutations, and the associated extension and tightening ofcontainment measures are weighing on euro area economic activity in the short term. Looking ahead,the ongoing vaccination campaigns, together with the envisaged gradual relaxation of containmentmeasures, underpin the expectation of a firm rebound in economic activity in the course of 2021.Inflation has picked up over recent months mainly on account of some transitory factors and anincrease in energy price inflation. At the same time, underlying price pressures remain subdued in thecontext of weak demand and significant slack in labour and product markets. While our latest staffprojection exercise foresees a gradual increase in underlying inflation pressures, it confirms that themedium-term inflation outlook remains broadly unchanged from the staff projections in December 2020and below our inflation aim.In these conditions, preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period remainsessential. Financing conditions are defined by a holistic and multifaceted set of indicators, spanningthe entire transmission chain of monetary policy from risk-free interest rates and sovereign yields tocorporate bond yields and bank credit conditions. Market interest rates have increased since the startof the year, which poses a risk to wider financing conditions. Banks use risk-free interest rates andsovereign bond yields as key references for determining credit conditions. If sizeable and persistent,increases in these market interest rates, when left unchecked, could translate into a prematuretightening of financing conditions for all sectors of the economy. This is undesirable at a time whenpreserving favourable financing conditions still remains necessary to reduce uncertainty and bolsterconfidence, thereby underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability.Against this background, the Governing Council decided the following:First, we will continue to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchaseprogramme (PEPP) with a total envelope of \u20ac1,850 billion until at least the end of March 2022 and, inany case, until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. Based on a jointJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:16 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210311~d368d7151a.en.html 2/12assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Council expects purchasesunder the PEPP over the next quarter to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during thefirst months of this year.We will purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening offinancing conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on theprojected path of inflation. In addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes andamong jurisdictions will continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy. If favourablefinancing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelopeover the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full. Equally, theenvelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter thenegative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.We will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under thePEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will bemanaged to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.Second, net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of\u20ac20 billion. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long asnecessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before westart raising the key ECB interest rates.We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the keyECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditionsand an ample degree of monetary accommodation.Third, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect themto remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to alevel sufficiently close to, but below, 2 per cent within our projection horizon, and such convergencehas been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.Finally, we will continue to provide ample liquidity through our refinancing operations. In particular, ourthird series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) remains an attractive source offunding for banks, supporting bank lending to firms and households.Preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period for all sectors of the economyremains essential to underpin economic activity and safeguard medium-term price stability. We willalso continue to monitor developments in the exchange rate with regard to their possible implicationsfor the medium-term inflation outlook. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate,to ensure that inflation moves towards our aim in a sustained manner, in line with our commitment tosymmetry.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Followingthe strong rebound in growth in the third quarter of 2020, euro area real GDP declined by 0.7 per centin the fourth quarter. Looking at the full year, real GDP is estimated to have contracted by 6.6 per centin 2020, with the level of economic activity for the fourth quarter of the year standing 4.9 per centbelow its pre-pandemic level at the end of 2019.11/23/23, 4:16 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210311~d368d7151a.en.html 3/12Incoming economic data, surveys and high-frequency indicators point to continued economicweakness in the first quarter of 2021 driven by the persistence of the pandemic and the associatedcontainment measures. As a result, real GDP is likely to contract again in the first quarter of the year.Economic developments continue to be uneven across countries and sectors, with the services sectorbeing more adversely affected by the restrictions on social interaction and mobility than the industrialsector, which is recovering more quickly. Although fiscal policy measures are supporting householdsand firms, consumers remain cautious in the light of the pandemic and its impact on employment andearnings. Moreover, weaker corporate balance sheets and elevated uncertainty about the economicoutlook are still weighing on business investment.Looking ahead, the ongoing vaccination campaigns, together with the gradual relaxation ofcontainment measures \u2013 barring any further adverse developments related to the pandemic \u2013underpin the expectation of a firm rebound in economic activity in the course of 2021. Over themedium term, the recovery of the euro area economy should be supported by favourable financingconditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a recovery in demand as containment measures aregradually lifted.This assessment is broadly reflected in the baseline scenario of the March 2021 ECB staffmacroeconomic projections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP growth at4.0 per cent in 2021, 4.1 per cent in 2022 and 2.1 per cent in 2023. Compared with the December2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for economic activity is broadlyunchanged.Overall, the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook over the medium term have become morebalanced, although downside risks remain in the near term. On the one hand, better prospects forglobal demand, bolstered by the sizeable fiscal stimulus, and the progress in vaccination campaignsare encouraging. On the other hand, the ongoing pandemic, including the spread of virus mutations,and its implications for economic and financial conditions continue to be sources of downside risk.Euro area annual inflation increased sharply to 0.9 per cent in January and February 2021, up from-0.3 per cent in December. The upswing in headline inflation reflects a number of idiosyncratic factors,such as the end of the temporary VAT rate reduction in Germany, delayed sales periods in some euroarea countries and the impact of the stronger than usual changes in HICP weights for 2021, as well ashigher energy price inflation. On the basis of current oil futures prices, headline inflation is likely toincrease in the coming months, but some volatility is expected throughout the year reflecting thechanging dynamics of the factors currently pushing inflation up. These factors can be expected to fadeout of annual inflation rates early next year. Underlying price pressures are expected to increasesomewhat this year due to current supply constraints and the recovery in domestic demand, althoughpressures are expected to remain subdued overall, also reflecting low wage pressures and the pastappreciation of the euro. Once the impact of the pandemic fades, the unwinding of the high level ofslack, supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, will contribute to a gradual increasein inflation over the medium term. Survey-based measures and market-based indicators of longer-terminflation expectations remain at subdued levels, although market-based indicators have continued theirgradual increase.11/23/23, 4:16 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210311~d368d7151a.en.html 4/12This assessment is broadly reflected in the baseline scenario of the March 2021 ECB staffmacroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresees annual inflation at 1.5 per cent in 2021,1.2 per cent in 2022 and 1.4 per cent in 2023. Compared with the December 2020 Eurosystem staffmacroeconomic projections, the outlook for inflation has been revised up for 2021 and 2022, largelydue to temporary factors and higher energy price inflation, while it is unchanged for 2023.Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of broad money (M3) stood at 12.5 per centin January 2021, after 12.4 per cent in December and 11.0 per cent in November 2020. Strong moneygrowth continued to be supported by the ongoing asset purchases by the Eurosystem, which remainthe largest source of money creation. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 has remained the maincontributor to broad money growth, consistent with a still heightened preference for liquidity in themoney-holding sector and a low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid forms of money.Developments in loans to the private sector were characterised by somewhat weaker lending to non-financial corporations and resilient lending to households. The monthly lending flow to non-financialcorporations continued the moderation observed since the end of the summer. At the same time, theannual growth rate remained broadly unchanged, at 7.0 per cent, after 7.1 per cent in December, stillreflecting the very strong increase in lending in the first half of the year. The annual growth rate ofloans to households remained broadly stable at 3.0 per cent in January, after 3.1 per cent inDecember, amid a solid positive monthly flow.Overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments and otherEuropean institutions, remain essential to support bank lending conditions and access to financing, inparticular for those most affected by the pandemic.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary tosupport economic activity and the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to,2 per cent over the medium term.Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical in view of thesharp contraction in the euro area economy. To this end, support from national fiscal policies shouldcontinue given weak demand from firms and households relating to the ongoing pandemic and theassociated containment measures. At the same time, fiscal measures taken in response to thepandemic emergency should, as much as possible, remain temporary and targeted in nature toaddress vulnerabilities effectively and to support a swift recovery. The three safety nets endorsed bythe European Council for workers, businesses and governments provide important funding support.The Governing Council recognises the key role of the Next Generation EU package and stresses theimportance of it becoming operational without delay. It calls on Member States to ensure a timelyratification of the Own Resources Decision, to finalise their recovery and resilience plans promptly andto deploy the funds for productive public spending, accompanied by productivity-enhancing structuralpolicies. This would allow the Next Generation EU programme to contribute to a faster, stronger andmore uniform recovery and would increase economic resilience and the growth potential of MemberStates\u2019 economies, thereby supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area. Suchstructural policies are particularly important in addressing long-standing structural and institutionalweaknesses and in accelerating the green and digital transitions.", "32": "11/23/23, 4:16 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220310~1bc8c1b1ca.en.html 1/11MONET ARY POLICY  STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 10 March 2022Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a watershed for Europe. The Governing Council expresses its fullsupport to the people of Ukraine. We will ensure smooth liquidity conditions and implement thesanctions decided by the European Union and European governments. We will take whatever action isneeded to fulfil the ECB\u2019s mandate to pursue price stability and to safeguard financial stability.The Russia-Ukraine war will have a material impact on economic activity and inflation through higherenergy and commodity prices, the disruption of international commerce and weaker confidence. Theextent of these effects will depend on how the conflict evolves, on the impact of current sanctions andon possible further measures. In recognition of the highly uncertain environment, the GoverningCouncil considered a range of scenarios in today\u2019s meeting.The impact of the Russia-Ukraine war has to be assessed in the context of solid underlying conditionsfor the euro area economy, helped by ample policy support. The recovery of the economy is boostedby the fading impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant. Supply bottlenecks have been showing somesigns of easing and the labour market has been improving further. In the baseline of the new staffprojections, which incorporate a first assessment of the implications of the war, GDP growth has beenrevised downwards for the near term, owing to the war in Ukraine. The projections foresee theeconomy growing at 3.7 per cent in 2022, 2.8 per cent in 2023 and 1.6 per cent in 2024.Inflation has continued to surprise on the upside because of unexpectedly high energy costs. Pricerises have also become more broadly based. The baseline for inflation in the new staff projections hasbeen revised upwards significantly, with annual inflation at 5.1 per cent in 2022, 2.1 per cent in 2023and 1.9 per cent in 2024. Inflation excluding food and energy is projected to average 2.6 per cent in2022, 1.8 per cent in 2023 and 1.9 per cent in 2024, also higher than in the December projections.Longer-term inflation expectations across a range of measures have re-anchored at our inflationtarget. The Governing Council sees it as increasingly likely that inflation will stabilise at its two per centtarget over the medium term.In alternative scenarios for the economic and financial impact of the war, which will be publishedtogether with the staff projections on our website, economic activity could be dampened significantly bya steeper rise in energy and commodity prices and a more severe drag on trade and sentiment.Inflation could be considerably higher in the near term. However, in all scenarios, inflation is stillexpected to decrease progressively and settle at levels around our two per cent inflation target in2024.Jump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:16 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220310~1bc8c1b1ca.en.html 2/11Based on our updated assessment and taking into account the uncertain environment, the GoverningCouncil today revised the purchase schedule for its asset purchase programme (APP) for the comingmonths. Monthly net purchases under the APP will amount to \u20ac40 billion in April, \u20ac30 billion in May and\u20ac20 billion in June. The calibration of net purchases for the third quarter will be data-dependent andreflect our evolving assessment of the outlook. If the incoming data support the expectation that themedium-term inflation outlook will not weaken even after the end of our net asset purchases, theGoverning Council will conclude net purchases under the APP in the third quarter. If the medium-terminflation outlook changes and if financing conditions become inconsistent with further progress towardsour two per cent target, we stand ready to revise our schedule for net asset purchases in terms of sizeand/or duration.Any adjustments to the key ECB interest rates will take place some time after the end of our netpurchases under the APP and will be gradual. The path for the key ECB interest rates will continue tobe determined by the Governing Council\u2019s forward guidance and by its strategic commitment tostabilise inflation at two per cent over the medium term. Accordingly, the Governing Council expectsthe key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels until it sees inflation reaching two per centwell ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and itjudges that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent withinflation stabilising at two per cent over the medium term.We also confirmed our other policy measures, as detailed in the  published at 13:45today.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing, and will thenexplain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityThe economy grew by 5.3 per cent in 2021, with GDP returning to its pre-pandemic level at the end ofthe year. However, growth slowed to 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2021 and is expected to remainweak during the first quarter of 2022.The prospects for the economy will depend on the course of the Russia-Ukraine war and on the impactof economic and financial sanctions and other measures. At the same time, other headwinds to growthare now waning. In the baseline of the staff projections, the euro area economy should still growrobustly in 2022 but the pace will be slower than was expected before the outbreak of the war.Measures to contain the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant have had a milder impact thanduring previous waves and are now being lifted. The supply disruptions caused by the pandemic alsoshow some signs of easing. The impact of the massive energy price shock on people and businessesmay be partly cushioned by drawing on savings accumulated during the pandemic and bycompensatory fiscal measures.Over the medium term, according to the baseline of the staff projections, growth will be driven byrobust domestic demand, supported by a stronger labour market. With more people in jobs,households should earn higher incomes and spend more. The global recovery and the ongoing fiscaland monetary policy support are also contributing to this growth outlook. Fiscal and monetary supportremains critical, especially in this difficult geopolitical situation.press release11/23/23, 4:16 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220310~1bc8c1b1ca.en.html 3/11InflationInflation increased to 5.8 per cent in February, from 5.1 per cent in January. We expect it to rise furtherin the near term. Energy prices, which surged by 31.7 per cent in February, continue to be the mainreason for this high rate of inflation and are also pushing up prices across many other sectors. Foodprices have also increased, owing to seasonal factors, elevated transportation costs and the higherprice of fertilisers. Energy costs have risen further in recent weeks and there will be further pressureon some food and commodity prices owing to the war in Ukraine.Price rises have become more widespread. Most measures of underlying inflation have risen overrecent months to levels above two per cent. However, it is uncertain how persistent the rise in theseindicators will be, given the role of temporary pandemic-related factors and the indirect effects ofhigher energy prices. Market-based indicators suggest that energy prices will stay high for longer thanpreviously expected but will moderate over the course of the projection horizon. Price pressuresstemming from global supply bottlenecks should also subside.Labour market conditions have continued to improve, with unemployment falling to 6.8 per cent inJanuary. Even though labour shortages are affecting more and more sectors, wage growth remainsmuted overall. Over time, the return of the economy to full capacity should support somewhat fastergrowth in wages. Various measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived from financialmarkets and from surveys stand at around two per cent. These factors will also contribute further tounderlying inflation and will help headline inflation to settle durably at our two per cent target.Risk assessmentThe risks to the economic outlook have increased substantially with the Russian invasion of Ukraineand are tilted to the downside. While risks relating to the pandemic have declined, the war in Ukrainemay have a stronger effect on economic sentiment and could worsen supply-side constraints again.Persistently high energy costs, together with a loss of confidence, could drag down demand more thanexpected and constrain consumption and investment.The same factors are risks to the outlook for inflation, which are on the upside in the near term. Thewar in Ukraine is a substantial upside risk, especially to energy prices. If price pressures feed throughinto higher than anticipated wage rises or if there are adverse persistent supply-side implications,inflation could also turn out to be higher over the medium term. However, if demand were to weakenover the medium term, this could also lower pressures on prices.Financial and monetary conditionsThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused substantial volatility in financial markets. Following theoutbreak of the war, risk-free market interest rates have partially reversed the increase observed sinceour February meeting and equity prices have fallen.The financial sanctions against Russia, including the exclusion of some Russian banks from SWIFT,have so far not caused severe strains in money markets or liquidity shortages in the euro area bankingsystem. Bank balance sheets remain healthy overall, owing to robust capital positions and fewer non-performing loans. Banks are now as profitable as they were before the pandemic.11/23/23, 4:16 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220310~1bc8c1b1ca.en.html 4/11Bank lending rates for firms have increased somewhat, while lending rates for household mortgagesremain steady at historically low levels. Lending flows to firms have declined after increasing stronglyin the last quarter of 2021. Lending to households is holding up, especially for house purchases.ConclusionSumming up, the Russian invasion of Ukraine will negatively affect the euro area economy and hassignificantly increased uncertainty. If the baseline of the staff projections materialises, the economyshould continue to rebound thanks to the declining impact of the pandemic and the prospect of soliddomestic demand and strong labour markets. Fiscal measures, including at the European Union level,would also help to shield the economy. Based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook andtaking into account the uncertain environment, we revised our schedule for net asset purchases overthe coming months and confirmed all our other policy measures. We are very attentive to the prevailinguncertainties. The calibration of our policies will remain data-dependent and reflect our evolvingassessment of the outlook. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments to ensure that inflationstabilises at our two per cent target over the medium term.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *A lot of the recent communication from the ECB has been about how supply driven the currentinflation and even core inflation surge is, so how much agreement was there in the GoverningCouncil about accelerating the pace of normalisation now?Secondly: your new guidance states that interest rates will follow some time after net bondbuying ends so does that mean that we are back to excluding rate hikes later this year, or howdoes that square with the significantly higher inflation projections you just presented?Thank you very much for your three questions. First of all, in terms of Governing Council: we had veryintense discussions about the current economic situation, about the outlook, about the uncertainty. Andas with most institutions, communities, families \u2013 and probably you all \u2013 the war of Russia againstUkraine has tainted and overshadowed a lot of those discussions. There were different views aroundthe table - in all directions. But after those good discussions there was a determination by allGoverning Council members to rally the proposal that was put together by the Executive Board andpresented by our Chief Economist. It takes a balanced approach. It delivers on the mandate that wehave, which as you know is price stability in the face of what we are seeing.Your second question related to accelerating normalisation. That was not the decision that was madetoday. The decision that was made was to progress step by step, to acknowledge the addeduncertainty that we are facing and to therefore have added optionalities so that we can in allcircumstances respond in an agile way. You will have noted that our decision in relation to assetpurchases under the APP is conditional and clearly states that we have a declining pace of purchasefor Q2 and that for Q3, if the outlook for medium-term inflation is confirmed by the data, we will indeedend asset purchases. But if on the other hand the data \u2013 which are critically important because we aredata dependent in our decisions \u2013 do not support this medium-term outlook as we see it now, then we", "33": "11/23/23, 3:50 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230316~6c10b087b5.en.html 1/12MONET ARY POLICY  STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 16 March 2023Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.Inflation is projected to remain too high for too long. Therefore, the Governing Council today decided toincrease the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points, in line with our determination to ensurethe timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. The elevated level of uncertaintyreinforces the importance of a data-dependent approach to our policy rate decisions, which will bedetermined by our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financialdata, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.We are monitoring current market tensions closely and stand ready to respond as necessary topreserve price stability and financial stability in the euro area. The euro area banking sector is resilient,with strong capital and liquidity positions. In any case, our policy toolkit is fully equipped to provideliquidity support to the euro area financial system if needed and to preserve the smooth transmissionof monetary policy.The new ECB staff macroeconomic projections were finalised in early March before the recentemergence of financial market tensions. As such, these tensions imply additional uncertainty aroundthe baseline assessments of inflation and growth. Prior to these latest developments, the baseline pathfor headline inflation had already been revised down, mainly owing to a smaller contribution fromenergy prices than previously expected. ECB staff now see inflation averaging 5.3 per cent in 2023,2.9 per cent in 2024 and 2.1 per cent in 2025. At the same time, underlying price pressures remainstrong. Inflation excluding energy and food continued to increase in February and ECB staff expect itto average 4.6 per cent in 2023, which is higher than foreseen in the December projections.Subsequently, it is projected to come down to 2.5 per cent in 2024 and 2.2 per cent in 2025, as theupward pressures from past supply shocks and the reopening of the economy fade out and as tightermonetary policy increasingly dampens demand.The baseline projections for growth in 2023 have been revised up to an average of 1.0 per cent as aresult of both the decline in energy prices and the economy\u2019s greater resilience to the challenginginternational environment. ECB staff then expect growth to pick up further, to 1.6 per cent, in both 2024and 2025, underpinned by a robust labour market, improving confidence and a recovery in realincomes. At the same time, the pick-up in growth in 2024 and 2025 is weaker than projected inDecember, owing to the tightening of monetary policy.The decisions taken today are set out in a  available on our website.Jump to the transcript of the questions and answerspress release11/23/23, 3:50 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230316~6c10b087b5.en.html 2/12I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explainour assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityThe euro area economy stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2022, thus avoiding the previously expectedcontraction. However, private domestic demand fell sharply. High inflation, prevailing uncertainties andtighter financing conditions dented private consumption and investment, which fell by 0.9 per cent and3.6 per cent respectively.Under the baseline, the economy looks set to recover over the coming quarters. Industrial productionshould pick up as supply conditions improve further, confidence continues to recover, and firms workoff large order backlogs. Rising wages and falling energy prices will partly offset the loss of purchasingpower that many households are experiencing as a result of high inflation. This, in turn, will supportconsumer spending.Moreover, the labour market remains strong, despite the weakening of economic activity. Employmentgrew by 0.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the unemployment rate stayed at its historicallow of 6.6 per cent in January 2023.Government support measures to shield the economy from the impact of high energy prices should betemporary, targeted and tailored to preserving incentives to consume less energy. As energy prices falland risks around the energy supply recede, it is important to start rolling back these measurespromptly and in a concerted manner. Measures falling short of these principles are likely to drive upmedium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a stronger monetary policy response.Moreover, in line with the EU\u2019s economic governance framework and as stated in the EuropeanCommission\u2019s guidance of 8 March 2023, fiscal policies should be oriented towards making oureconomy more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euroarea\u2019s supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, can help reduce price pressures in the mediumterm. To that end, governments should swiftly implement their investment and structural reform plansunder the Next Generation EU programme. The reform of the EU\u2019s economic governance frameworkshould be concluded rapidly.InflationInflation edged down to 8.5 per cent in February. The decline resulted from a renewed sharp drop inenergy prices. By contrast, food price inflation increased further, to 15.0 per cent, with the past surgein the cost of energy and of other inputs for food production still feeding through to consumer prices.Moreover, underlying price pressures remain strong. Inflation excluding energy and food increased to5.6 per cent in February and other indicators of underlying inflation have also stayed high. Non-energyindustrial goods inflation rose to 6.8 per cent in February, mainly reflecting the delayed effects of pastsupply bottlenecks and high energy prices. Services inflation, which rose to 4.8 per cent in February, isalso still being driven by the gradual pass-through of past energy cost increases, pent-up demand fromthe reopening of the economy and rising wages.11/23/23, 3:50 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230316~6c10b087b5.en.html 3/12Wage pressures have strengthened on the back of robust labour markets and employees aiming torecoup some of the purchasing power lost owing to high inflation. Moreover, many firms were able toraise their profit margins in sectors faced with constrained supply and resurgent demand. At the sametime, most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around two per cent,although they warrant continued monitoring, especially in light of recent volatility in market-basedinflation expectations.Risk assessmentRisks to the outlook for economic growth are tilted to the downside. Persistently elevated financialmarket tensions could tighten broader credit conditions more strongly than expected and dampenconfidence. Russia\u2019s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people continues to be a significantdownside risk to the economy and could again push up the costs of energy and food. There could alsobe an additional drag on euro area growth if the world economy weakened more sharply thanexpected. However, companies could adapt more quickly to the challenging international environmentand, together with the fading-out of the energy shock, this could support higher growth than currentlyexpected.The upside risks to inflation include existing pipeline pressures that could still send retail prices evenhigher than expected in the near term. Domestic factors, such as a persistent rise in inflationexpectations above our target or higher than anticipated increases in wages and profit margins, coulddrive inflation higher, including over the medium term. Moreover, a stronger than expected economicrebound in China could give a fresh boost to commodity prices and foreign demand. The downsiderisks to inflation include persistently elevated financial market tensions that could acceleratedisinflation. In addition, falling energy prices could translate into reduced pressure from underlyinginflation and wages. A weakening of demand, including owing to a stronger deceleration of bank creditor a stronger than projected transmission of monetary policy, would also contribute to lower pricepressures than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term.Financial and monetary conditionsMarket interest rates rose considerably in the weeks following our last meeting. But the increase hasstrongly reversed over recent days in a context of severe financial market tensions. Bank credit to euroarea firms has become more expensive. Credit to firms has weakened further, owing to lower demandand tighter credit supply conditions. Household borrowing has become more expensive as well,especially owing to higher mortgage rates. This rise in borrowing costs and the resultant decline indemand, along with tighter credit standards, have led to a further slowdown in the growth of loans tohouseholds. Amid these weaker loan dynamics, money growth has slowed sharply, driven by its mostliquid components.ConclusionSumming up, inflation is projected to remain too high for too long. Therefore, the Governing Counciltoday decided to increase the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points, in line with ourdetermination to ensure the timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target.

We are monitoring current market tensions closely and stand ready to respond asnecessary to preserve price stability and financial stability in the euro area.In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflationreturns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policytransmission.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *I was wondering, could you explain a little bit how you see the path of interest rates ahead?Until a few days ago, it seemed pretty clear that interest rates would have to rise further afterthis meeting, but you didn't give any guidance in the statement. Does this mean it could be thatwe've already reached the peak in interest rates?Then secondly, regarding the banking sector more broadly: a lot of people have drawn parallelsbetween what happened at Credit Suisse and Silicon Valley Bank between, and failures we'veseen in the last financial crisis like Bear Stearns. Did you see any risks that we are on the vergeof a systemic crisis like in 2008?On your first question: I would call your attention to one particular paragraph, which is the first one inour monetary policy statement in which we are really trying to dissect for you the mechanism of ourreaction function. This is really the best guidance that we can provide and it is 1) the assessment ofthe inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, 2) the dynamics of underlyinginflation, and 3) the strength of our monetary policy transmission. So, that's brand new. These threecomponents, we never discussed them, we never let them out and they are clearly identified as thethree elements that will be taken into account to determine our reaction function going forward.Second point: if our baseline was to persist when the uncertainty reduces, we know that we have a lotmore ground to cover. But it's a big caveat. If our baseline was to persist. As you know, the projectionsthat were determined by staff \u2013 are based on data and assessment of the situation with a cut-off date.That cut-off date was 15 February for the international outlook and technical assumptions and 1 Marchfor the euro area macroeconomic projections. Now, since 1 March a lot obviously has developed andthe projections that we have do not incorporate any of the most recent developments and certainly notthe impact of the most recent financial tensions that we have observed on the markets.So, there is a level of uncertainty that has been completely elevated as a result of that, and that is thereason why we reinforced the principle of data dependency that we have indicated in the past with aclear map of the reaction function that we will have in the future. So, it is not possible at this point intime and on the basis of the first component that I have mentioned, which is assessment of theinflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, it is not possible to determine atthis point in time what the path will be going forward. But we know that it will be data dependent andwe know that if the baseline as we have it was confirmed and was to persist, we would have moreground to cover.", "34": "11/23/23, 3:49 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230504~f242392c72.en.html 1/12MONET ARY POLICY  STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 4 May 2023Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.The inflation outlook continues to be too high for too long. In light of the ongoing high inflationpressures, the Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basispoints. Overall, the incoming information broadly supports the assessment of the medium-terminflation outlook that we formed at our previous meeting. Headline inflation has declined over recentmonths, but underlying price pressures remain strong. At the same time, our past rate increases arebeing transmitted forcefully to euro area financing and monetary conditions, while the lags andstrength of transmission to the real economy remain uncertain.Our future decisions will ensure that the policy rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive toachieve a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target and will be kept at thoselevels for as long as necessary. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determiningthe appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our policy rate decisions will continue tobe based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financialdata, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.The key ECB interest rates remain our primary tool for setting the monetary policy stance. In parallel,we will keep reducing the Eurosystem\u2019s asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio at a measured andpredictable pace. In line with these principles, the Governing Council expects to discontinue thereinvestments under the APP as of July 2023.The decisions taken today are set out in a  available on our website.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explainour assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityThe euro area economy grew by 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, according to Eurostat\u2019spreliminary flash estimate. Lower energy prices, the easing of supply bottlenecks and fiscal policysupport for firms and households have contributed to the resilience of the economy. At the same time,private domestic demand, especially consumption, is likely to have remained weak.Business and consumer confidence have recovered steadily in recent months but remain weaker thanbefore Russia\u2019s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people. We see a divergence across sectors ofthe economy. The manufacturing sector is working through a backlog of orders, but its prospects areJump to the transcript of the questions and answerspress release11/23/23, 3:49 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230504~f242392c72.en.html 2/12worsening. The services sector is growing more strongly, especially owing to the reopening of theeconomy.Household incomes are benefiting from the strength of the labour market, with the unemployment ratefalling to a new historical low of 6.5 per cent in March. Employment has continued to grow and totalhours worked exceed pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, the average number of hours workedremains somewhat below its pre-pandemic level and its recovery has stalled since mid-2022.As the energy crisis fades, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and ina concerted manner to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for astronger monetary policy response. Fiscal policies should be oriented towards making our economymore productive and gradually bringing down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area\u2019ssupply capacity, especially in the energy sector, can also help reduce price pressures in the mediumterm. In this regard, we welcome the publication of the European Commission\u2019s legislative proposalsfor the reform of the EU\u2019s economic governance framework, which should be concluded soon.InflationAccording to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, inflation was 7.0 per cent in April, after having dropped from 8.5per cent in February to 6.9 per cent in March. While base effects led to some increase in energy priceinflation, from -0.9 per cent in March to 2.5 per cent in April, the rate stands far below those recordedafter the start of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. Food price inflation remains elevated, however,standing at 13.6 per cent in April, after 15.5 per cent in March.Price pressures remain strong. Inflation excluding energy and food was 5.6 per cent in April, havingedged down slightly compared with March to return to its February level. Non-energy industrial goodsinflation fell to 6.2 per cent in April, from 6.6 per cent in March, when it declined for the first time inseveral months. But services inflation increased to 5.2 per cent in April, from 5.1 per cent in March.Inflation is still being pushed up by the gradual pass-through of past energy cost increases and supplybottlenecks. In services, especially, it is still being pushed higher also by pent-up demand from thereopening of the economy and by rising wages. The information available up to March suggests thatindicators of underlying inflation remain high.Wage pressures have strengthened further as employees, in a context of a robust labour market,recoup some of the purchasing power they have lost as a result of high inflation. Moreover, in somesectors firms have been able to increase their profit margins on the back of mismatches betweensupply and demand and the uncertainty created by high and volatile inflation. Although most measuresof longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around two per cent, some indicators haveedged up and warrant continued monitoring.Risk assessmentRenewed financial market tensions, if persistent, would pose a downside risk to the outlook for growthas they could tighten broader credit conditions more strongly than expected and dampen confidence.Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine also continues to be a significant downside risk to the economy.However, the recent reversal of past adverse supply shocks, if sustained, could spur confidence and11/23/23, 3:49 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230504~f242392c72.en.html 3/12support higher growth than currently expected. The continued resilience of the labour market, bybolstering household confidence and spending, could also lead to higher growth than anticipated. There are still significant upside risks to the inflation outlook. These include existing pipeline pressuresthat could send retail prices higher than expected in the near term. Moreover, Russia\u2019s war againstUkraine could again push up the costs of energy and food. A lasting rise in inflation expectations aboveour target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflationhigher, including over the medium term. Recent negotiated wage agreements have added to theupside risks to inflation, especially if profit margins remain high. The downside risks include renewedfinancial market tensions, which could bring inflation down faster than projected. Weaker demand, duefor example to a more marked slowing of bank lending or a stronger transmission of monetary policy,would also lead to lower price pressures than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term.Financial and monetary conditionsThe euro area banking sector has proved resilient in the face of the financial market tensions thatarose ahead of our last meeting. Our policy rate increases are being transmitted strongly to risk-freeinterest rates and to the financing conditions for firms, households and banks. For firms andhouseholds, loan growth has weakened owing to higher borrowing rates, tighter credit supplyconditions and lower demand. Our latest bank lending survey reported a tightening of overall creditstandards, which was stronger than banks had expected in the previous round and suggests thatlending may weaken further. Weak lending has meant that money growth has also continued todecline.ConclusionSumming up, the inflation outlook continues to be too high for too long. In light of the ongoing highinflation pressures, the Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by25 basis points. Overall, the incoming information broadly supports the assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook that we formed at our previous meeting. Headline inflation has declined overrecent months, but underlying price pressures remain strong.

Howconcerned are you about potential spillover effects to the euro area?Thank you for your question. I will take the first and ask my colleague and friend Vice-President Luisde Guindos to address the second one. So let me tell you a little bit about the mood in the room of theGoverning Council. I would characterise the mood as determined \u2013 all governors are determined tofight inflation, tame inflation and return it to 2% over the medium term. And we all concluded, as youhave seen, that the inflation outlook is too high and has been so for too long. I would say then that themood was very focused and yet, it is an in-between-projections Governing Council meeting. But wewere extremely attentive to all data that was available to us and obviously one case in point is theBank Lending Survey that you all received or saw on Tuesday when it was published and whichcontains a lot of intelligence and information about the intention and the comparison between thelending practices and standards with what was expected by the banks. I\u2019m happy to come back to thatlater, but it explains obviously the decision that we made for this 25 basis point increase.I think in terms of method, we were method-dependent in many ways just as we are data-dependent,because we have articulated the reaction function of our monetary policy decisions, with the three keyelements of the inflation outlook informed by the financial and economic data, the dynamics ofunderlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. So we checked all the data thatwe had against these three criteria. And as is always the case at the Governing Council meeting, therewere a variety of views expressed and I think that it\u2019s fair to say that everybody agreed that increasingrates was necessary; that second, we are not pausing, that\u2019s very clear, and, third, we know that wehave more ground to cover on the basis of the baseline that we had, which is still guiding us until wehave our next projection exercise, and on the basis of the data that we have received in the course ofthe last few days and that we brought together during the meeting.I think the ultimate balancing act, which received almost unanimous support and that is reflected in themonetary policy statement in front of you, was really predicated on the methods, the data we received,and the understanding that where we are is totally consistent with the baseline that we had for theoutlook last time around. Remember, at the last March meeting that\u2019s what I said. And second, thatunderlying inflation is still high and third, informed by the bank lending survey and the data that wehave concerning interest rates, which is a little bit outdated because it goes back to February, thetransmission of our monetary policy is working at least [with regards] to the financing leg and we arenot yet certain about the next leg, which is transmission from banks to the real economy. So it\u2019s on thebasis of all that, that we made our decision. Now that we have increased rates significantly andsometimes by very large increments, establishing absolute credibility on our determination, it wassensible, in view of what I have told you, to return to a more standard increment, with theunderstanding that, based on the information we have today, we have more ground to cover and weare not pausing \u2013 that\u2019s extremely clear.De Guindos: Turning to your second question, I think that we should start with a consideration: if youlook at the characteristics of the US banks that are running into difficulties, I think that there are some", "35": "11/23/23, 4:13 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is181025.en.html 1/11INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEMario Draghi, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-Presidentof the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 25 October 2018Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council, whichwas also attended by the Commission Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interestrates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through thesummer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustainedconvergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we will continue to make net purchases underthe asset purchase programme (APP) at the new monthly pace of \u20ac15 billion until the end ofDecember 2018. We anticipate that, subject to incoming data confirming our medium-term inflationoutlook, we will then end net purchases. We intend to reinvest the principal payments from maturingsecurities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of our net assetpurchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and anample degree of monetary accommodation.Incoming information, while somewhat weaker than expected, remains overall consistent with anongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation pressures.The underlying strength of the economy continues to support our confidence that the sustainedconvergence of inflation to our aim will proceed and will be maintained even after a gradual winding-down of our net asset purchases. At the same time, uncertainties relating to protectionism,vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility remain prominent. Significantmonetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures andheadline inflation developments over the medium term. This support will continue to be provided by thenet asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and theassociated reinvestments, and by our enhanced forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates. Inany event, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensurethat inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council\u2019s inflation aim in a sustained manner.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro areareal GDP increased by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in both the first and the second quarter of 2018.Incoming information, while somewhat weaker than expected, remains overall consistent with ourbaseline scenario of an ongoing broad-based economic expansion, supported by domestic demandand continued improvements in the labour market. Some recent sector-specific developments arehaving an impact on the near-term growth profile. Our monetary policy measures continue to underpinJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:13 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is181025.en.html 2/11domestic demand. Private consumption is fostered by ongoing employment growth and rising wages.At the same time, business investment is supported by solid domestic demand, favourable financingconditions and corporate profitability. Housing investment remains robust. In addition, the expansion inglobal activity is expected to continue supporting euro area exports, though at a slower pace.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced. At thesame time, risks relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial marketvolatility remain prominent.Euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 2.1% in September 2018, from 2.0% in August, reflectingmainly higher energy and food price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual ratesof headline inflation are likely to hover around the current level over the coming months. Whilemeasures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows.Domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of capacity utilisation andtightening labour markets. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the endof the year and to increase further over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures,the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth stood at 3.5% in September 2018, after3.4% in August. Apart from some volatility in monthly flows, M3 growth is increasingly supported bybank credit creation. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broadmoney growth.The growth of loans to the private sector strengthened further, continuing the upward trend observedsince the beginning of 2014. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rose to4.3% in September 2018, from 4.1% in August, while the annual growth rate of loans to householdsstood at 3.1%, unchanged from the previous month. The euro area bank lending survey for the thirdquarter of 2018 indicates that loan growth continues to be supported by increasing demand across allloan categories and favorable bank lending conditions for loans to enterprises and loans for housepurchase.The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues tosignificantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing \u2013 in particularfor small and medium-sized enterprises \u2013 and credit flows across the euro area.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary forthe continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over themedium term.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contributemore decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. Theimplementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up toincrease resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growthpotential. Regarding fiscal policies, the broad-based expansion calls for rebuilding fiscal buffers. Thisis particularly important in countries where government debt is high and for which full adherence to theStability and Growth Pact is critical for safeguarding sound fiscal positions. Likewise, the transparent11/23/23, 4:13 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is181025.en.html 3/11and consistent implementation of the EU\u2019s fiscal and economic governance framework over time andacross countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving thefunctioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council urges specificand decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union.We are now at your disposal for questions.* * *Did you discuss downgrading your risk assessment to tilted to the downside? What were themain arguments for and against in the discussion?Second question is about Italy, as you can imagine. In the past you said, \u201cLook at the facts andnot the words\u201d, but the facts have been coming in and then haven't been that good. There's abudget in breach of EU rules; it's been rejected by the Commission. Now with facts on thetable, what is your assessment now?Let me answer the first question; it will require a little time. By and large, the Governing Councildiscussions you've seen from the introductory statement confirmed the balance of risks and of coursedidn't take any decision on monetary policy. There was acknowledgement of a somewhat weakermomentum, but in the midst of most eurozone countries \u2013 which still have positive output gaps, andslightly expansionary and sometimes in some cases pro-cyclical fiscal policies in some countries.We're talking about a weaker momentum, not a downturn. This is clearly certified by most surveyindicators that have come out since the last time we met. But these indicators remain above \u2013 and insome cases well above \u2013 historical averages and certainly is certified by slower growth. Then the issueis: what are the reasons behind this weaker momentum and these weaker survey indicators? Here wego into a variety of explanations, one of which certainly is country-specific factors; so-calledidiosyncratic phenomena. Think about the car sector in Germany. This is having quite a powerful effectfor this quarter but not next quarter.The second is the export performance. Last time we discussed the export performance saying that lastyear, 2017, had an extraordinary export performance. Now we're coming back to normal and so wehad a decline in exports that seems now is reflected in the current weaker momentum, but seems nowto have come to a halt. Then of course we have trade uncertainties. We have the stalemate betweenUS and China, with Brexit, with Italy, with financial market volatility, so a bunch of uncertainties. Thenwe have perhaps the one important part of the explanation; it's simply that we're having growthreturning to potential after 2017, where it was clearly above potential.It's not simple here to distinguish what is transitory from what is going to be permanent, what is countryspecific from what is extended to the whole of the euro area. What is actually having an impact onconsumption and investment and what is not having an impact. For one thing, we still observeconsumption; pretty strong, buoyed by an expanding employment, an expanding labour market, risingwages and so business investment. Also the emerging market economy situation seems to havestabilised somehow. All in all, the assessment of the Governing Council was, yes, there is a weakermomentum. Yes, there are weaker survey data coming out and maybe some more expected in thefuture. But is this enough of a change to make us change the baseline scenario? The answer is no.These risks are not being considered at this point in time enough to change the balance of risks. Now,11/23/23, 4:13 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is181025.en.html 4/11of course we'll have to see the projections in December and that was also one other consideration. Iwill elaborate on inflation and monetary policy later.On Italy, you have to remember that Italy is a fiscal discussion, so there wasn't much discussion aboutItaly. As a matter of fact, the Vice-President, Dombrovskis, was there and basically, I asked himpermission to quote him, to quote what he said. He said, \u201cOf course we have to observe and applyfiscal rules but we're also seeking a dialogue\u201d. I think that's what it is, but then I could answer otherquestions about the facts.Still again about Italy. I would like to refer to your recent statement that the Italian situation wasnot posing any risks of contagion. My question is whether you confirm this statement orwhether it has changed.No, I didn't say there wasn\u2019t any risk of contagion; I said at that point in time there was no sign ofcontagion. It's different.Okay, let me also respond to the other part of the question I was asked before about; what are thefacts? First let me say, what's the context. The context of our discussion today was, as I said before,the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission, who said of course he has to apply fiscal rulesbut he's also seeking a dialogue. The second point of context is what I said in the previous pressconference in the IMF, during the course of the IMF meetings, is that I'm personally \u2013 and that's apersonal perception so take it for what it's worth \u2013 I am confident that an agreement will be found.Now let me come to the facts. Interest rates have come up and are coming up. That means the lendingrates are going up still moderately, I should say, for households and for firms. It means that householdswill have to pay more for borrowing from banks and so do companies. Of course in the case ofcompanies that finance, fund themselves issuing bonds, the pass-through from the capital markets tothe bond market \u2013 to the corporate bond market \u2013 is obviously faster. For them, the increase inborrowing rates has been more marked and quicker. Now, all this likely means that it will have effectson credit and ultimately on growth and, by the way, on the very same space that is needed for fiscalexpansion. In a sense, if the interest rates keep on going up, the room that is available to expand thebudget gets smaller.As I said, the increases in interest rates have been there now for a while. We've analysed it both fromsurveys and through direct evidence; these increasing rates. But these increasing rates are not so far\u2013 at least banking rates \u2013 are not significant, or not material. However we have now the bank lendingsurvey of this quarter. It does say that basically, terms and conditions applied by Italian banks on newloans to enterprises and households for house purchases, tightened. Terms and conditions \u2013 so notstandards \u2013 terms and conditions tightened in the third quarter of 2018, driven by a higher cost offunds and balance sheet constraints.Now, what about the spillovers? Since the last time I spoke about this, we have observed someincrease in interest rates in some other countries, or non-core countries, let's call them this way. Againit's not material but it's been there. And so again the issue is: what's the cause of them; because thesecountries themselves had specific idiosyncratic phenomena, facts, events that may justify, and havebeen estimated to justify, some increase in rates. So far we reached I think the conclusion that it's kind", "36": "11/23/23, 4:10 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is191024~78a5550bc1.en.html 1/14INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEMario Draghi, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-Presidentof the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 24 October 2019Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council, whichwas also attended by the Commission Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis, and the incoming President,Ms Lagarde.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interestrates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen theinflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projectionhorizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.As decided at our last meeting in September, we will restart net purchases under our asset purchaseprogramme (APP) at a monthly pace of \u20ac20 billion as from 1 November. We expect them to run for aslong as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly beforewe start raising the key ECB interest rates.We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the keyECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditionsand an ample degree of monetary accommodation.The Governing Council reiterated the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for aprolonged period of time to support underlying inflation pressures and headline inflation developmentsover the medium term. In particular, the Governing Council\u2019s forward guidance will ensure that financialconditions adjust in accordance with changes to the inflation outlook. In any case, the GoverningCouncil continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflationmoves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.The incoming data since the last Governing Council meeting in early September confirm our previousassessment of a protracted weakness in euro area growth dynamics, the persistence of prominentdownside risks and muted inflation pressures. At the same time, ongoing employment growth andincreasing wages continue to underpin the resilience of the euro area economy. The comprehensivepackage of policy measures that we decided at our last meeting provides substantial monetarystimulus, which will contribute to a further easing in borrowing conditions for firms and households.This will support the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus,the sustained convergence of inflation to our medium-term inflation aim.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro areareal GDP growth was confirmed at 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2019, following aJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:10 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is191024~78a5550bc1.en.html 2/14rise of 0.4% in the previous quarter. Incoming economic data and survey information continue to pointto moderate but positive growth in the second half of this year. This slowdown in growth mainly reflectsthe ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of persistent global uncertainties, whichcontinue to weigh on the euro area manufacturing sector and are dampening investment growth.At the same time, the services and construction sectors remain resilient, despite some moderation.The euro area expansion is supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains inconjunction with rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing \u2013 albeitsomewhat slower \u2013 growth in global activity.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain on the downside. In particular, these riskspertain to the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionismand vulnerabilities in emerging markets.Euro area annual HICP inflation decreased from 1.0% in August 2019 to 0.8% in September, reflectinglower food and energy price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation islikely to decline slightly further before rising again at the end of the year. Measures of underlyinginflation remained generally muted and indicators of inflation expectations stand at low levels. Whilelabour cost pressures have strengthened amid tighter labour markets, the weaker growth momentumis delaying their pass-through to inflation. Over the medium term inflation is expected to increase,supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and robust wagegrowth.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth increased to 5.7% in August 2019, after5.1% in July. Sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for theprivate sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continuesto be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side.The growth of loans to firms and households remained solid, benefiting from the continued pass-through of our accommodative monetary policy stance to bank lending rates. The annual growth rateof loans to non-financial corporations increased to 4.3% in August, from 4.0% in July 2019, while theannual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged at 3.4% in August. The euro areabank lending survey for the third quarter of 2019 indicates a slight easing of credit standards andincreasing demand for loans to households, while demand for loans to firms remained broadly stable.Our accommodative monetary policy stance will help to safeguard favourable bank lending conditionsand will continue to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary forthe continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over themedium term.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contributemore decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential, supporting aggregate demand at thecurrent juncture and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural policies in euro areacountries needs to be substantially stepped up to boost euro area productivity and growth potential,11/23/23, 4:10 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is191024~78a5550bc1.en.html 3/14reduce structural unemployment and increase resilience. The 2019 country-specific recommendationsshould serve as the relevant signpost.Regarding fiscal policies, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance is currently providing somesupport to economic activity. In view of the weakening economic outlook and the continuedprominence of downside risks, governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timelymanner. In countries where public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudent policies and meetstructural balance targets, which will create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely. Allcountries should intensify their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances.Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the European Union\u2019s fiscal and economicgovernance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience ofthe euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority.The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps tocomplete the banking union and the capital markets union.We are now at your disposal for questions.* * *The IMF just at their last meeting raised concerns about the effects of low interest rates on thefinancial system, so my first question would be: what makes you so confident that more ofnegative rates and quantitative easing or asset purchases is doing more good than harm?My second question would be on your legacy and whether you feel it's been tarnished by therecent discussions, which were unusually public, about the rift in the Governing Council andthe disagreement about the policy action taken?President Draghi: Well, the IMF didn't say that the negative rates are ineffective. As a matter of fact,the overall assessment of negative rates is generally positive. For us, it's very positive; it's been a verypositive experience. Negative rates have stimulated the economy and affected positively employment,and so all in all we're exactly in the direction we wanted them to be. But the IMF also raised concernsabout potential side effects of very negative rates for a long time. The discussion really didn't go intotoo much detail, but we are also aware of that and we are monitoring these risks. I should say that firstof all we should distinguish different categories: banks, insurance companies, pension funds and otherintermediaries. The overall assessment has been clearly positive. In other words, the improvements inthe economy have more than offset negative side effects from low rates. The fact that we aremonitoring this constantly is shown by our decision in early September of introducing a tiering system,which basically partly compensates the banks from the negative rates.Now, your second question: frankly, the answer is no. We have discussions, everybody hasdiscussions, all jurisdictions have disagreements when monetary policy decisions come to bediscussed. These disagreements are often made public, often they are not, so I think it's not been thefirst time. I've taken this as part and parcel of the ongoing debate and discussions.I have two questions. The first one is about the fact that the Governing Council tasked therelevant Eurosystem committees with examining options for the size and composition ofpotential new net asset purchases. Taking into account eventual committees' options and evenif the Governing Council did not discuss this topic, given that the markets consider the APP\u2019s11/23/23, 4:10 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is191024~78a5550bc1.en.html 4/14firepower crucial, what is your opinion on the options that could be considered in enlarging theAPP?My second question is looking forward: what do you see are the main risks on your risk radarthat you can foresee for the European economy and for the financial markets? In other words,what should we all worry about the most on the short-term and long-term horizon?President Draghi: Since you're going back to the issue of voting and committees, let me just give you afew highlights. First of all, I will read sentences from the public account; the account you've seen. First,all members agreed that the further easing of monetary policy stance was warranted. Then we had anopen discussion about the choice of instruments best suited to address current challenges. We giveaccount of these discussions. Then we start going bit by bit, saying what sort of majority was for eachpart of the discussion. We say a clear majority of Governing Council members supported the broadpackage of measures that was ultimately decided upon in September. A large majority of membersagreed to change the modalities of the new series of TLTROs. All members concurred with continuedreinvestment. Members generally agreed with the proposal to enhance the state-based component ofthe Governing Council forward guidance on interest rates. A clear majority of members agreed with theproposal to restart net purchases under the asset purchase programme, with the modalities that I'vejust explained. A very large majority of members agreed with the proposal to lower the rate on thedeposit facility by ten basis points. Finally, a majority of members went along with the proposedintroduction of the two-tier system for reserve remuneration. This comes straight from the publicaccount that you've seen.No surprise that today, basically, the proposal of the chief economist \u2013 namely, to maintain themonetary policy stance \u2013 went, basically, through and was approved with unanimity. So it's notsurprising, given these majorities. Now, coming to your point about the committees, let me again goback to the Introductory Statement in July, where we tasked the committees with examining options,including ways to reinforce our forward guidance on policy rates, mitigating measures such as thedesign of a tiered system for reserve remuneration, and options for the size and composition ofpotential new asset purchases. This is the introductory statement in July. Then, we have already gonethrough this on other occasions, but the function of the committees is to provide technical advice to theGoverning Council and that's what they did. Then the Governing Council of course decides as itdeems appropriate. It's not the first time that the Governing Council has a different mind; it's happenedmany other times, so no surprises there. It's all in a sense confirmed by maintaining the monetarypolicy stance today.What are the main risks? Well, the main risk from all viewpoints, but especially also from a financialstability viewpoint, is a downturn in the economy. Whether it's global or it's the eurozone, that I thinkwould be the main risk from all viewpoints: from the side of convergence of inflation to our objectiveobviously, from the angle of maintaining a high level of employment and of economic activity and ofnominal wage growth as we have seen today, and from the angle of financial stability itself. Becauseclearly one of the great benefits that the banking sector \u2013 actually all players in the financial system \u2013had from this accommodative monetary policy was the extraordinary improvement in the quality oftheir credit, of their assets more generally, which comes with a recovery, which basically affectedpositively the profitability of the banking system.", "37": "11/23/23, 4:17 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is201029~80b00b5789.en.html 1/13INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 29 October 2020Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council, whichwas also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.The resurgence in coronavirus (COVID-19) infections presents renewed challenges to public healthand the growth prospects of the euro area and global economies. Incoming information signals that theeuro area economic recovery is losing momentum more rapidly than expected, after a strong, yetpartial and uneven, rebound in economic activity over the summer months. The rise in COVID-19cases and the associated intensification of containment measures is weighing on activity, constituting aclear deterioration in the near-term outlook. In fact, while activity in the manufacturing sector hascontinued to recover, activity in the services sector has been slowing visibly. Although fiscal policymeasures are supporting households and firms, consumers are cautious in the light of the pandemicand its ramifications for employment and earnings. Moreover, weaker balance sheets and increaseduncertainty about the economic outlook are weighing on business investment. Headline inflation isbeing dampened by low energy prices and muted underlying price pressures in the context of weakdemand and significant slack in labour and product markets.The monetary policy measures that we have taken since early March are helping to preservefavourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions across the euro area, thereby providingcrucial support to underpin economic activity and to safeguard medium-term price stability. At the sametime, in the current environment of risks clearly tilted to the downside, the Governing Council willcarefully assess the incoming information, including the dynamics of the pandemic, prospects for arollout of vaccines and developments in the exchange rate. The new round of Eurosystem staffmacroeconomic projections in December will allow a thorough reassessment of the economic outlookand the balance of risks. On the basis of this updated assessment, the Governing Council willrecalibrate its instruments, as appropriate, to respond to the unfolding situation and to ensure thatfinancing conditions remain favourable to support the economic recovery and counteract the negativeimpact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path. This will foster the convergence of inflationtowards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.In the meantime, we decided to reconfirm our accommodative monetary policy stance.We will keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present orlower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to,Jump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:17 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is201029~80b00b5789.en.html 2/13but below, 2 percent within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistentlyreflected in underlying inflation dynamics.We will continue our purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with atotal envelope of \u20ac1,350 billion. These purchases contribute to easing the overall monetary policystance, thereby helping to offset the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path ofinflation. The purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across assetclasses and among jurisdictions. This allows us to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmissionof monetary policy. We will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until at least the end of June2021 and, in any case, until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. Wewill reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at leastthe end of 2022. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoidinterference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.Net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of \u20ac20billion, together with the purchases under the additional \u20ac120 billion temporary envelope until the endof the year. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long asnecessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before westart raising the key ECB interest rates. We intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principalpayments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past thedate when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary tomaintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.We will also continue to provide ample liquidity through our refinancing operations. In particular, ourthird series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) remains an attractive source offunding for banks, supporting bank lending to firms and households.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro areareal GDP contracted by 11.8 percent, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2020. Following thetrough in April 2020, the euro area economy rebounded strongly in the third quarter, making up abouthalf of the contraction in the first half of the year. The significant surge in coronavirus infection ratesand the associated intensification of containment measures since the summer constitute clearheadwinds to the short-term outlook. In fact, recent hard data, survey results and high-frequencyindicators point to a significant softening in economic activity in the final quarter of the year. Moreover,economic developments continue to be uneven across sectors. In particular, activity in the servicessector is slowing again as it is the sector most affected by the new restrictions on social activities andmobility. Looking ahead, while the uncertainty related to the evolution of the pandemic will likelydampen the strength of the recovery in the labour market and in consumption and investment, the euroarea economy should continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions and anexpansionary fiscal stance.Overall, the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are clearly tilted to the downside. Thislargely reflects the recent resurgence in COVID-19 infections, the associated intensification ofcontainment measures and a highly uncertain timeline of the pandemic and its implications foreconomic and financial conditions.11/23/23, 4:17 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is201029~80b00b5789.en.html 3/13Euro area annual inflation decreased to -0.3 percent in September, from -0.2 percent in August,reflecting developments in the prices of energy, non-energy industrial goods and services. On thebasis of oil price dynamics and taking into account the temporary reduction in German VAT, headlineinflation is likely to remain negative until early 2021. Moreover, near-term price pressures will remainsubdued owing to weak demand, notably in the tourism and travel-related sectors, as well as to lowerwage pressures and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate. Once the impact of the pandemicfades, a recovery in demand, supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, will putupward pressure on inflation over the medium term. Market-based indicators and survey-basedmeasures of longer-term inflation expectations remain broadly unchanged at low levels.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth rose to 10.4 percent in September 2020,from 9.5 percent in August, thus remaining well above the levels recorded before the COVID-19pandemic. Strong money growth continues to reflect domestic credit expansion and the ongoing assetpurchases by the Eurosystem, as well as precautionary considerations which foster a heightenedpreference for liquidity in the money-holding sector. In this environment, the narrow monetaryaggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the main contributor tobroad money growth.Developments in loans to the private sector continued to be shaped by the impact of the COVID-19pandemic on economic activity. Following strong increases in the early months of the pandemic, theannual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 7.1 percent in September,unchanged from August. This, however, masks a moderation in recent monthly loan flows. The annualgrowth rate of loans to households edged up to 3.1 percent in September, from 3.0 percent in August.Growth in loans to the private sector continues to benefit from historically low bank lending rates.According to our bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2020, credit conditions on loans to firmstightened. While banks indicated that their funding and balance sheet conditions remain supportive,higher risk perceptions could weigh on their attitude towards loan creation. Surveyed banks reported afall in firms\u2019 loan demand in the third quarter, reflecting a decline in emergency liquidity needs andweakening corporate investment. The survey indicates an increase in households\u2019 net demand forloans in the third quarter, while also suggesting the intention to tighten credit standards for households.Overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments andEuropean institutions, remain essential to support access to financing, including for those mostaffected by the ramifications of the pandemic.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary tosupport economic activity and the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to,2 percent over the medium term.Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of thesharp contraction in the euro area economy and the reduction in private demand. While fiscalmeasures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should, as much as possible, be targetedand temporary in nature, weak demand from firms and households and the heightened risk of adelayed recovery warrant continued support from national fiscal policies. The three safety nets11/23/23, 4:17 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is201029~80b00b5789.en.html 4/13endorsed by the European Council for workers, businesses and sovereigns provide important fundingsupport in this context.The Governing Council recognises the key role of the Next Generation EU package and stresses theimportance of it becoming operational without delay. Provided the funds are deployed for productivepublic spending and accompanied by productivity-enhancing structural policies, Next Generation EUwill contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery and will increase economic resilienceand the growth potential of Member States\u2019 economies, thereby supporting the effectiveness ofmonetary policy in the euro area. Such structural policies are particularly important in addressing long-standing structural and institutional weaknesses and in accelerating the green and digital transition.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *Can I ask you about whether you have been discussing by how much you might enlarge yoursupport programme by December, and which instruments you primarily have in mind? Is it anincrease in APP or PEPP or both? Will it be a package?Secondly, the Fed has been quite quick in adjusting with a new inflation target. Would youfollow suit quickly as well, and would you also consider the Fed is doing that now to allow foran overshooting of inflation?Lagarde: Well, thank you very much. Let me maybe take the opportunity of your question tosummarise for you what the Governing Council at large was in full agreement upon. The full GoverningCouncil was in total agreement to analyse the current economic situation and to recognise andacknowledge the fact that risks are clearly, clearly tilted to the downside. We all acknowledge the roleand the importance as a driving force of the pandemic and the increase of contagion, as well as theimpact that containment measures will have on the economy. So it is with that recognition and thatacknowledgement that we agreed, all of us, that it was necessary to take action, and therefore torecalibrate our instruments at our next Governing Council meeting. So the teams, the committees, staffmembers are already at work in order to do this recalibration exercise, and this recalibration exercisewill touch on all our instruments. It is not going to be one or the other. It is not going to be looking atone single instrument. It will be looking at all our instruments, how they interact together, what will bethe optimal outcome, and what will be the mix that will best address the situation. Because we also allagreed that the aim that we are pursuing is to make sure that we can maintain favourable financingconditions in order to help with the recovery, and in order to also address the negative consequencesresulting from the pandemic on our inflation path. So we will be looking at everything.Now, in the meantime, we're not going to just stand still. We are going to use all the instruments thatwe have with the entire flexibility that we have, and I'm clearly here referring to PEPP more thanothers, to address the situation and to address any development of the situation. We have done that inthe past. We have responded very promptly, very appropriately - very heavily, some would say - to thefirst wave that hit the euro area economies. We have done it for the first wave; we will do it again forthe second wave. But don't assume that it will be one instrument; we're going to look at all of them, thecombination of them all, to arrive at the best possible outcome to deal with the situation. As I said, with", "38": "11/23/23, 4:08 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is211028~939f22970b.en.html 1/12MONET ARY POLICY  STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 28 October 2021Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.The euro area economy continues to recover strongly, although momentum has moderated to someextent. Consumers continue to be confident and their spending remains strong. But shortages ofmaterials, equipment and labour are holding back production in some sectors. Inflation is rising,primarily because of the surge in energy prices but also as the recovery in demand is outpacingconstrained supply. We foresee inflation rising further in the near term, but then declining in the courseof next year.Market interest rates have increased since our last meeting in early September. However, overallfinancing conditions currently remain favourable for firms, households and the public sector.Favourable financing conditions are essential for the economy to continue its recovery and to counterthe negative impact of the pandemic on the inflation path.We continue to judge that favourable financing conditions can be maintained with a moderately lowerpace of net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) than in thesecond and third quarters of this year.We also confirmed our other measures, namely the level of the key ECB interest rates, our forwardguidance on their likely future evolution, our purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP),our reinvestment policies and our longer-term refinancing operations, as detailed in the published at 13:45 today. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensurethat inflation stabilises at our two per cent target over the medium term.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then talkabout our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityThe economy continued to grow strongly in the third quarter, even though momentum moderated tosome extent. We still expect output to exceed its pre-pandemic level by the end of the year.The grip of the pandemic on the economy has visibly weakened, with restrictions being lifted as aresult of successful health measures and large numbers of people now vaccinated. This is supportingconsumer spending, especially on entertainment, dining, travel and transportation. But higher energyprices may reduce purchasing power in the months to come.Jump to the transcript of the questions and answerspress release11/23/23, 4:08 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is211028~939f22970b.en.html 2/12The recovery in domestic and global demand is also supporting production and business investment.That said, shortages of materials, equipment and labour are holding back the manufacturing sector.Delivery times have lengthened considerably, and transport costs and energy prices have surged.These constraints are clouding the outlook for the coming quarters.The labour market continues to improve. Unemployment has fallen and the number of people in jobretention schemes is down significantly from the peak last year. This supports the prospect of higherincomes and increased spending. But, both the number of people in the labour force and the hoursworked in the economy remain below their pre-pandemic levels.To sustain the recovery, targeted and coordinated fiscal support should continue to complementmonetary policy. This support will also help the economy adjust to the structural changes that areunder way. An effective implementation of the Next Generation EU programme and the \u201cFit for 55\u201dpackage will contribute to a stronger, greener and more even recovery across euro area countries.InflationInflation increased to 3.4 per cent in September. We expect it to rise further this year. But while thecurrent phase of higher inflation will last longer than originally expected, we expect inflation to declinein the course of next year.The upswing in inflation largely reflects a combination of three factors. First, energy prices \u2013 especiallyfor oil, gas and electricity \u2013 have risen sharply. In September, energy inflation accounted for about halfof overall inflation. Second, prices are also going up because recovering demand related to thereopening of the economy is outpacing supply. These dynamics are especially visible in the prices ofconsumer services, as well as the prices of goods affected most strongly by supply shortages. Andfinally, base effects related to the end of the VAT cut in Germany are still contributing to higher inflation.We expect the influence of all three factors to ease in the course of 2022 or to fall out of the year-on-year inflation calculation. As the recovery continues, the gradual return of the economy to full capacitywill underpin a rise in wages over time. Market and survey-based measures of longer-term inflationexpectations have moved closer to two per cent. These factors will support underlying inflation and thereturn of inflation to our target over the medium term.Risk assessmentThe recovery continues to depend on the course of the pandemic and further progress withvaccinations. We see the risks to the economic outlook as broadly balanced. In the near term, supplybottlenecks and rising energy prices are the main risks to the pace of recovery and the outlook forinflation. If supply shortages and higher energy prices last longer, these could slow down the recovery.At the same time, if persistent bottlenecks feed through into higher than anticipated wage rises or theeconomy returns more quickly to full capacity, price pressures could become stronger. However,economic activity could outperform our expectations if consumers become more confident and saveless than currently expected.Financial and monetary conditions11/23/23, 4:08 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is211028~939f22970b.en.html 3/12Growth and medium-term inflation dynamics still depend on favourable financing conditions for allsectors of the economy. Market interest rates have increased. Nevertheless, financing conditions forthe economy remain favourable, not least because bank lending rates for firms and households remainat historically low levels. While there was a pick-up in September, lending to firms remains moderate.This continues to reflect the fact that firms generally need less external funding, since these have highcash holdings and are increasingly retaining their earnings. Lending to households remains strong,driven by demand for mortgages. Our most recent bank lending survey shows that credit conditions forfirms stabilised and were supported \u2013 for the first time since 2018 \u2013 by a reduction in banks\u2019 riskperceptions. By contrast, banks are taking a slightly more cautious approach to housing loans andhave tightened their lending standards for these loans accordingly. Bank balance sheets continue to besupported by favourable funding conditions and remain solid.ConclusionSumming up, the euro area economy continues to recover strongly, although at a more moderatepace. Rising energy prices, the recovery in demand and supply bottlenecks are currently pushing upinflation. While inflation will take longer to decline than previously expected, we expect these factors toease in the course of next year. We continue to foresee inflation in the medium term remaining belowour two per cent target. Our policy measures, including our revised forward guidance on the key ECBinterest rates, are crucial to helping the economy shift to a sustained recovery and, ultimately, tobringing inflation over the medium term to our target.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *President Lagarde, thank you very much for taking my questions. I was wondering, becausethe markets were \u2013 well, everybody was anticipating that this meeting was all about inflation,so what have you been discussing, and what was on top of your agenda? Was there at least aslightly different assessment to the nature of inflation, given that inflation is at a 30-year highnow for the eurozone.My second question would be on the market expectation about the rate hike. Economists weresaying that the market has not fully absorbed your new forward guidance. Perhaps you can tellus more about it and why the market is wrong to expect a rate hike already by next year.Lagarde: Thank you very much. Actually, we talked about inflation, inflation, inflation. That has been atopic that has occupied a lot of our time and a lot of our debates. We went I think in-depth intoanalysing the factors that are driving inflation. We looked at, obviously, what is happening now, whichis clearly of concern, particularly to citizens of Europe, but we also looked at the medium-term outlookthat we have. I think I would summarise those factors driving inflation, as we see it at the moment, intwo key categories. One is related to pandemic and recovery, and the other one is related to energy. Ifyou look at the one that is related to recovery and the post-pandemic period, we are seeing shortages.We're seeing shortages in equipment; we're seeing shortages in labour, and that has to do with thefact that the rebound of demand, the decompressed demand, if you will, is not exactly connected withthe supply, and we have this supply-demand disconnection.11/23/23, 4:08 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is211028~939f22970b.en.html 4/12The second, as I said, is energy, and on that front we have drivers of the energy prices that have to dowith the recovery, that have to do with the demand, but also other factors having to do with inventory,with the wind, with maintenance in Norway, with demand in China, with the supply by Russia. Allelements that actually are contributing to the high energy prices that we are facing at the moment.Those are the three key buckets that are causing inflation as we discussed it today and yesterdayafternoon. Now, there is a third category, which is very much related to the base effects, and I wouldput first and foremost, obviously, the German VAT, which is going to continue to impact our inflationnumbers until the end of this year, but which will disappear as of 1 January. So that's one categorybase effect that will fade as of the beginning of the year. We also believe that the other two bucketsthat I have just discussed with you, that is recovery-related and pandemic consequences on the onehand, energy prices on the other hand. We have every reason to believe that they are going togradually fade over the course of 2022. I'm happy to discuss further, but there might be otherquestions on these particular matters.We did talk a lot about those, and we did a lot of soul-searching to actually test our analysis, and weare confident that this analysis of the temporality of those two categories is actually correct, and willlead to a decline over the course of '22. Now, granted, it will take a little longer than what we hadexpected, and the bottlenecks will gradually be sorted out, but it will take a bit longer. On the energyfront, we also believe that it's in the course of '22 that we will see a decline in \u2013 at least a stabilisation,if not a decline of energy prices. So that was predominantly what we discussed with members of theGoverning Council this morning and yesterday. We also, obviously, looked at the financial conditionsthat prevail at the moment in order to arrive at our monetary policy decisions, but inflation took a lot ofour time, and it takes quite a bit of the space of the monetary policy statement that you have in front ofyou.I would, by the way, add that our analysis certainly does not support that the conditions of our forwardguidance are satisfied at the time of lift-off, as expected by markets, nor any time soon thereafter. Soyou asked me about this market expectations regarding lift-offs, and we look at all of that, but we reallyvery deeply looked and tested our analysis of the drivers of inflation, and we are confident that ouranticipation and our analysis is actually correct.President Lagarde, you and many of your colleagues have pushed back against the idea thatyou need to tighten policy in response to the inflation spike that we're seeing, but many of yourglobal counterparts have in fact started doing so. So could you explain in what ways theeurozone's underlying inflation dynamics are fundamentally different to those that we see inother advanced economies, or do you think that other central banks might be overreacting tothe rise in prices?Secondly, on the PEPP pace, you decided in September to slow your PEPP purchases to amoderate slower pace in the fourth quarter, but we haven't actually seen that in any of theweekly data so far this month. So does this have to do with countering the effects of policy-tightening expectations, or how should we read this data?Lagarde: Well, let me start with the latter part of your question, which has to do with our PEPPpurchases, and the decision that we made and that we reiterated this morning at our monetary policymeeting to slow the pace of purchase as compared with the second and third quarter of 2021.

We took today\u2019s decision, and expect to raise interest rates further,to ensure the timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term inflation target. We will basethe future policy rate path on the evolving outlook for inflation and the economy, following our meeting-by-meeting approach.Inflation remains far too high and will stay above our target for an extended period. In September, euroarea inflation reached 9.9 per cent. In recent months, soaring energy and food prices, supplybottlenecks and the post-pandemic recovery in demand have led to a broadening of price pressuresand an increase in inflation. Our monetary policy is aimed at reducing support for demand andguarding against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations.The Governing Council also decided to change the terms and conditions of the third series of targetedlonger-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). During the acute phase of the pandemic, thisinstrument played a key role in countering downside risks to price stability. Today, in view of theunexpected and extraordinary rise in inflation, it needs to be recalibrated to ensure that it is consistentwith the broader monetary policy normalisation process and to reinforce the transmission of our policyrate increases to bank lending conditions. We therefore decided to adjust the interest rates applicableto TLTRO III from 23 November 2022 and to offer banks additional voluntary early repayment dates.Finally, in order to align the remuneration of minimum reserves held by credit institutions with theEurosystem more closely with money market conditions, we decided to set the remuneration ofminimum reserves at the ECB\u2019s deposit facility rate.The decisions taken today are set out in a  available on our website. The details of thechanges to the TLTRO III terms and conditions are described in a separate  to bepublished at 15:45 CET. Another , detailing the change to the remuneration ofminimum reserves, will also be published at 15:45 CET.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explainour assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityJump to the transcript of the questions and answerspress releasepress releasetechnical press release11/23/23, 3:59 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is221027~358a06a35f.en.html 2/13Economic activity in the euro area is likely to have slowed significantly in the third quarter of the year,and we expect a further weakening in the remainder of this year and the beginning of next year. Byreducing people\u2019s real incomes and pushing up costs for firms, high inflation continues to dampenspending and production. Severe disruptions in the supply of gas have worsened the situation further,and both consumer and business confidence have fallen rapidly, which is also weighing on theeconomy. Demand for services is slowing, after a strong performance in previous quarters when thosesectors most affected by the pandemic-related restrictions reopened, and survey-based indicators fornew orders in the manufacturing sector are falling. Moreover, global economic activity is growing moreslowly, in a context of persistent geopolitical uncertainty, especially owing to Russia\u2019s unjustified waragainst Ukraine, and tighter financing conditions. Worsening terms of trade, as the prices paid forimports rise faster than those received for exports, are weighing on incomes in the euro area.The labour market continued to perform well in the third quarter, and the unemployment rate remainedat the historically low level of 6.6 per cent in August. While short-term indicators suggest that jobs werestill being created in the third quarter, the weakening of the economy could lead to somewhat higherunemployment in the future.To limit the risk of fuelling inflation, fiscal support measures to shield the economy from the impact ofhigh energy prices should be temporary and targeted at the most vulnerable. Policymakers shouldprovide incentives to lower energy consumption and bolster energy supply. At the same time,governments should pursue fiscal policies that show they are committed to gradually bringing downhigh public debt ratios. Structural policies should be designed to increase the euro area\u2019s growthpotential and supply capacity and to boost its resilience, thereby contributing to a reduction in medium-term price pressures. The swift implementation of the investment and structural reform plans under theNext Generation EU programme will make an important contribution to these objectives.InflationInflation rose to 9.9 per cent in September, reflecting further increases in all components. Energy priceinflation, at 40.7 per cent, remained the main driver of overall inflation, with an increasing contributionfrom gas and electricity prices. Food price inflation also rose further, to 11.8 per cent, as high inputcosts made food production more expensive.Supply bottlenecks are gradually easing, though their lagged impact is still contributing to inflation. Theimpact of pent-up demand, while weakening, is still driving up prices in the services sector. Thedepreciation of the euro has added to the build-up of inflationary pressures.Price pressures are evident in more and more sectors, in part owing to the impact of high energy costsfeeding through to the whole economy. Measures of underlying inflation have thus remained atelevated levels. Among those measures, inflation excluding energy and food rose further to 4.8 percent in September.Strong labour markets are likely to support higher wages, as is some catch-up in wages tocompensate for higher inflation. Incoming wage data and recent wage agreements indicate that thegrowth of wages may be picking up. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currentlystand at around two per cent, although further above-target revisions to some indicators warrantcontinued monitoring.11/23/23, 3:59 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is221027~358a06a35f.en.html 3/13Risk assessmentThe incoming data confirm that risks to the economic growth outlook are clearly on the downside,especially in the near term. A long-lasting war in Ukraine remains a significant risk. Confidence coulddeteriorate further and supply-side constraints could worsen again. Energy and food costs could alsoremain persistently higher than expected. A weakening world economy could be an additional drag ongrowth in the euro area.The risks to the inflation outlook are primarily on the upside. The major risk in the short term is afurther rise in retail energy prices. Over the medium term, inflation may turn out to be higher thanexpected if there are increases in the prices of energy and food commodities and a stronger pass-through to consumer prices, a persistent worsening of the production capacity of the euro areaeconomy, a persistent rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher than anticipated wagerises. By contrast, a decline in energy costs and a further weakening of demand would lower pricepressures.Financial and monetary conditionsBank funding costs are increasing in response to the rise in market interest rates. Borrowing has alsobecome more expensive for firms and households. Bank lending to firms remains robust, as they needto finance high production costs and build up inventories. At the same time, demand for loans tofinance investment has continued to decline. Lending to households is moderating, as credit standardshave tightened and demand for loans has decreased in a context of rising interest rates and lowconsumer confidence.Our most recent bank lending survey reports that credit standards tightened for all loan categories inthe third quarter of the year, as banks are becoming more concerned about the deteriorating outlookfor the economy and the risks faced by their customers in the current environment. Banks expect tocontinue tightening their credit standards in the fourth quarter.ConclusionSumming up, today we have raised the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points, and expect toraise interest rates further, to ensure the timely return of inflation to our medium-term target. With thisthird major policy rate increase in a row, we have made substantial progress in withdrawing monetarypolicy accommodation. The changes to the terms and conditions of our targeted longer-termrefinancing operations will also contribute to the ongoing policy normalisation process.Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meetingapproach. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflationreturns to our medium-term inflation target.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *Could you tell us whether you are comfortable with the expectation that interest rate steps aregoing to slow after today's decision and peak somewhere around 3% next year?11/23/23, 3:59 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is221027~358a06a35f.en.html 4/13Secondly: since we're now at the lower end of the neutral rate estimates, would it be fair toassume that the ECB could be ready to lay out a plan for reducing its balance sheet at its nextmeeting in December?So that is a bag of questions that you put into one question! What we have done with the decisiontaken today is making yet more progress in withdrawing the accommodative [policy] and [the] supportto demand that was made available. So we have made substantial progress in withdrawing that. Havewe completed the job? Have we finished the normalisation of our monetary policy as we have calledit? No. There is still ground to cover. What we have reiterated now is that we are going to decide thefuture path and pace of our rate increases on the basis of the data that we have, and we will do someeting-by-meeting. So we are very much and deliberately turning our back to forward guidance,which is not helpful in the current circumstances given the level of uncertainty that we have prettymuch all around.So what we are saying here is: Number one, we continue and make substantial progress inwithdrawing. We will have further rate increases in the future so the normalisation process continues.At some point in time, we will have of course to identify the rate which will deliver the 2% medium-termtarget that we have. So the destination for us is clear. The exact pace will be determined meeting-by-meeting. To do that, as I said, it will be data dependent and it will be meeting-by-meeting but we willlook precisely at three key factors. Just to give you a bit of flavour of how we are going to work in thenext meetings that we have.First, we will look of course at the inflation outlook, which takes into account the evolution of theeconomy, including the higher likelihood of a recession. So number one is the inflation outlook, this iswhat we are fighting, it\u2019s inflation, that's the first one. Second is, we will also take into account themeasures that we have taken so far because in the last three meetings including this one, we havehiked by 200 basis points. Third, we will also be attentive to the transmission lag of monetary policyand we know, as we do that, that any decision that we make is not going to have an immediate impacton inflation, but will be subject to the time lag that always affects monetary policy decisions. That givesyou \u2013 I hope \u2013 a bit of the flavour of the thinking and the rationale behind those decisions that will bemade and those hikes that we will decide in the near future.I think you had a second question which had to do with our balance sheet, so you covered it all in onequestion \u2013 not all because there are lots of other interesting and decisive matters that we discussed.Well, let us call it the reduction of our APP monetary portfolio. This is a matter that we have discussedat our last retreat amongst ourselves, the governors. We did not discuss the substantive issues today\u2013 deliberately \u2013 because we decided on a lot of issues. But what we decided is that we would pursuethat discussion and we would decide the key principles of the reduction of our APP monetary portfolioin December. So that gives you a bit of an indication of when those key principles will be discussedand decided, and I will be very pleased to inform you about those principles at our next monetarypolicy meeting in December. And that has to be of course in advance of the decision to implement andto roll out this reduction.Two questions for you. The first is with respect to the neutral rates. You said at the last meeting\u2013 and this is a quote \u2013 \u201cWhat I can tell you is that the further away we are, the larger the step weare taking, which is why we are front-loading now.\u201d Given that the deposit rate is now 1.5", "40": "11/23/23, 3:48 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is231026~c23b4eb5f0.en.html 1/11MONET ARY POLICY  STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBAthens, 26 October 2023Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. I would like to thankGovernor Stournaras for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to his staff for theexcellent organisation of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council.The Governing Council today decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged. Theincoming information has broadly confirmed our previous assessment of the medium-term inflationoutlook. Inflation is still expected to stay too high for too long, and domestic price pressures remainstrong. At the same time, inflation dropped markedly in September, including due to strong baseeffects, and most measures of underlying inflation have continued to ease. Our past interest rateincreases continue to be transmitted forcefully into financing conditions. This is increasinglydampening demand and thereby helps push down inflation.We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timelymanner. Based on our current assessment, we consider that the key ECB interest rates are at levelsthat, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to this goal. Ourfuture decisions will ensure that our policy rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long asnecessary.We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level andduration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of theinflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlyinginflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.The decisions taken today are set out in a  available on our website.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explainour assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityThe euro area economy remains weak. Recent information suggests that manufacturing output hascontinued to fall. Subdued foreign demand and tighter financing conditions are increasingly weighingon investment and consumer spending. The services sector is also weakening further. This is mainlybecause weaker industrial activity is spilling over to other sectors, the impetus from reopening effectsis fading and the impact of higher interest rates is broadening. The economy is likely to remain weakJump to the transcript of the questions and answerspress release11/23/23, 3:48 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is231026~c23b4eb5f0.en.html 2/11for the remainder of this year. But as inflation falls further, household real incomes recover and thedemand for euro area exports picks up, the economy should strengthen over the coming years.Economic activity has so far been supported by the strength of the labour market. The unemploymentrate stood at a historical low of 6.4 per cent in August. At the same time, there are signs that the labourmarket is weakening. Fewer new jobs are being created, including in services, consistent with thecooling economy gradually feeding through to employment.As the energy crisis fades, governments should continue to roll back the related support measures.This is essential to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would otherwise call foreven tighter monetary policy. Fiscal policies should be designed to make our economy moreproductive and to gradually bring down high public debt. Structural reforms and investments toenhance the euro area\u2019s supply capacity \u2013 which would be supported by the full implementation of theNext Generation EU programme \u2013 can help reduce price pressures in the medium term, whilesupporting the green and digital transitions. To that end, the reform of the EU\u2019s economic governanceframework should be concluded before the end of this year and progress towards Capital MarketsUnion and the completion of Banking Union should be accelerated.InflationInflation dropped to 4.3 per cent in September, almost a full percentage point lower than its Augustlevel. In the near term, it is likely to come down further, as the sharp price increases in energy andfood recorded in autumn 2022 will drop out of the yearly rates. September\u2019s decline was broad-based.Food price inflation slowed again, although it remains high by historical standards. In annual terms,energy prices fell by 4.6 per cent but, most recently, have risen again and become less predictable inview of the new geopolitical tensions.Inflation excluding energy and food dropped to 4.5 per cent in September, from 5.3 per cent in August.This fall was supported by improving supply conditions, the pass-through of previous declines inenergy prices, and the impact of tighter monetary policy on demand and corporate pricing power.Goods and services inflation rates fell substantially, to 4.1 per cent and 4.7 per cent respectively, withservices inflation also being pulled down by pronounced base effects. Price pressures in tourism andtravel appear to be moderating.Most measures of underlying inflation continue to decline. At the same time, domestic price pressuresare still strong, reflecting also the growing importance of rising wages. Measures of longer-terminflation expectations mostly stand around 2 per cent. Nonetheless, some indicators remain elevatedand need to be monitored closely.Risk assessmentThe risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. Growth could be lower if the effects ofmonetary policy turn out stronger than expected. A weaker world economy would also weigh ongrowth. Russia\u2019s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict triggered by the terrorist attacksin Israel are key sources of geopolitical risk. This may result in firms and households becoming lessconfident and more uncertain about the future, and dampen growth further. Conversely, growth couldbe higher than expected if the still resilient labour market and rising real incomes mean that people11/23/23, 3:48 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is231026~c23b4eb5f0.en.html 3/11and businesses become more confident and spend more, or the world economy grows more stronglythan expected.Upside risks to inflation could come from higher energy and food costs. The heightened geopoliticaltensions could drive up energy prices in the near term, while making the medium-term outlook moreuncertain. Extreme weather, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could push food prices upby more than expected. A lasting rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher thananticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over themedium term. By contrast, weaker demand \u2013 for example owing to a stronger transmission ofmonetary policy or a worsening of the economic environment in the rest of the world amid greatergeopolitical risks \u2013 would ease price pressures, especially over the medium term.Financial and monetary conditionsLonger-term interest rates have risen markedly since our last meeting, reflecting strong increases inother major economies. Our monetary policy continues to transmit strongly into broader financingconditions. Funding has become more expensive for banks, and interest rates for business loans andmortgages rose again in August, to 5.0 per cent and 3.9 per cent respectively.Higher borrowing rates, with the associated cuts in investment plans and house purchases, led to afurther sharp drop in credit demand in the third quarter, as reported in our latest bank lending survey.Moreover, credit standards for loans to firms and households tightened further. Banks are becomingmore concerned about the risks faced by their customers and are less willing to take on risksthemselves.Against this background, credit dynamics have weakened further. The annual growth rate of loans tofirms has dropped sharply, from 2.2 per cent in July to 0.7 per cent in August and 0.2 per cent inSeptember. Loans to households remained subdued, with the growth rate slowing to 1.0 per cent inAugust and 0.8 per cent in September. Amid weak lending and the reduction in the Eurosystembalance sheet, the annual growth rate of M3 fell to -1.3 per cent in August \u2013 the lowest level recordedsince the start of the euro \u2013 and still stood at -1.2 per cent in September.ConclusionThe Governing Council today decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged. Theincoming information has broadly confirmed our previous assessment of the medium-term inflationoutlook.

We will continue to follow adata-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction.In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflationreturns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policytransmission.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *What role did the recent weak economic data and the war in Gaza play in today's discussion?And secondly, did you discuss or at least begin talking about ending PEPP reinvestment earlieror raising banks\u2019 reserve requirements?Neither of these two questions, neither the PEPP, nor the remuneration of required reserves havebeen discussed at this meeting. You ask me about the current geopolitical environment and how thathas weighed on our decision. I think we repeat two or three times in the context of this monetary policystatement the risks posed by the geopolitical environment and these aggravated risks as we see themunfold and develop. And of course, you have a special sentence in the monetary policy statement(MPS) that refers specifically, in addition to the totally unjustified war of Russia against Ukraine, to thetragic developments as a result of the terrorist attack on Israel. We are monitoring the situation. Weare very attentive to the economic consequences that that could have, whether in terms of direct orindirect impact on energy prices, or the level of confidence that economic actors will continue todisplay.I have two questions. I think on many peoples\u2019 minds is the question how long is actually\u201csufficiently long\u201d and what will make you rethink and perhaps cut rates at one point in time?Is it at 2% inflation? Is it at 2.5? Is it at 3? I think that is something the market is interested in.My second question is on your comments about the yields, which are on the rise as well in theeuro area and you said from other jurisdictions or from other regions, you are probablyreferring to the United States. Are you concerned about that rise in yields as well and alsoabout the potential fragmentation here?So how long is \u201csufficiently long\u201d? Obviously, we refer to \u201ctimely manner\u201d, \u201csufficiently long\u201d, but in thesame breath I say we shall be data dependent. At this point of our fight against inflation and after tensuccessive hikes, now is not the time for forward guidance. Now is the time to really stick to our datadependency \u2018knitting\u2019 if I may say and we shall do so. We have acknowledged on the occasion of thismeeting that our assessment is confirmed, the assessment that we had in September. All numbers, ifanything, have reinforced our assessment of the situation. We have applied the three criteria that youall know well; the inflation outlook, duly informed by any information that we have, the underlyinginflation in all its compositions and the strength of the transmission of monetary policy. So, we willcontinue to be data dependent.Your second question was essentially when and at what level do you cut? This was not discussed atall, and the debate would be absolutely premature. We have acknowledged in our review of themacroeconomic situation back in September and yet again this time around, and we all know, and youknow, that labour cost, wages, profit units \u2013 the analysis of that \u2013 is critically important to determine the", "41": "11/23/23, 4:08 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180913.en.html 1/11INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEMario Draghi, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-Presidentof the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 13 September 2018Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council, whichwas also attended by the Commission Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interestrates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through thesummer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustainedconvergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we will continue to make net purchases underthe asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of \u20ac30 billion until the end of thismonth. After September 2018, we will reduce the monthly pace of the net asset purchases to \u20ac15billion until the end of December 2018 and we anticipate that, subject to incoming data confirming ourmedium-term inflation outlook, we will then end net purchases. We intend to reinvest the principalpayments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after theend of our net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourableliquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.The incoming information, including our new September 2018 staff projections, broadly confirms ourprevious assessment of an ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy and graduallyrising inflation. The underlying strength of the economy continues to support our confidence that thesustained convergence of inflation to our aim will proceed and will be maintained even after a gradualwinding-down of our net asset purchases. At the same time, uncertainties relating to risingprotectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility have gained moreprominence recently. Significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build-upof domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. This supportwill continue to be provided by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stockof acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by our enhanced forward guidance on thekey ECB interest rates. In any event, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of itsinstruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council\u2019sinflation aim in a sustained manner.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro areareal GDP increased by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2018, following growth at thesame rate in the previous quarter. Despite some moderation following the strong growth performancein 2017, the latest economic indicators and survey results overall confirm ongoing broad-based growthJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:08 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180913.en.html 2/11of the euro area economy. Our monetary policy measures continue to underpin domestic demand.Private consumption is supported by ongoing employment gains, which, in turn, partly reflect pastlabour market reforms, and by rising wages. Business investment is fostered by the favourablefinancing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. Housing investment remainsrobust. In addition, the expansion in global activity is expected to continue, supporting euro areaexports.This assessment is broadly reflected in the September 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections forthe euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 2.0% in 2018, 1.8% in 2019and 1.7% in 2020. Compared with the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, theoutlook for real GDP growth has been revised down slightly for 2018 and 2019, mainly due to asomewhat weaker contribution from foreign demand.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced. At thesame time, risks relating to rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financialmarket volatility have gained more prominence recently.According to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.0% in August 2018,down from 2.1% in July. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflationare likely to hover around the current level for the remainder of the year. While measures of underlyinginflation remain generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. Domestic costpressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tighteninglabour markets, which is pushing up wage growth. Uncertainty around the inflation outlook is receding.Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the end of the year and thereafter toincrease gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuingeconomic expansion and rising wage growth.This assessment is also broadly reflected in the September 2018 ECB staff macroeconomicprojections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.7% in 2018, 2019 and 2020,which is unchanged from the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth declined to 4.0% in July 2018, from4.5% in June. Apart from some volatility in monthly flows, M3 growth is increasingly supported by bankcredit creation. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad moneygrowth.The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 isproceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 4.1% in July 2018,while the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.0%, both unchanged from June.The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues tosignificantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing \u2013 in particularfor small and medium-sized enterprises \u2013 and credit flows across the euro area.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary forthe continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over themedium term.11/23/23, 4:08 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180913.en.html 3/11In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contributemore decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. Theimplementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up toincrease resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growthpotential. Regarding fiscal policies, the broad-based expansion calls for rebuilding fiscal buffers. Thisis particularly important in countries where government debt is high and for which full adherence to theStability and Growth Pact is critical for safeguarding sound fiscal positions. Likewise, the transparentand consistent implementation of the EU\u2019s fiscal and economic governance framework over time andacross countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving thefunctioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council urges specificand decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union.We are now at your disposal for questions.* * *You've decided to reduce bond purchases from October. But you've still left the ending of theprogramme at the end of the year open to or dependent on the incoming data. Could you walkus through the arguments behind that decision; why leaving the ending of the programme stillopen?Based on the forecast you've received today and the discussion that you had, would you saythat the output gap in the eurozone is already closed or is close to being closed this year? Orwe'll still have to wait for that to happen next year?The answer to your second question is that we have seen growth rates now for some time abovegrowth potential. To the first question, basically we haven't discussed this. My reading is here: we willreduce the monthly pace until the end of December. We anticipate that, subject to incoming dataconfirming our medium-term inflation outlook, we will then end net purchases. I think that's the text,that's what we've discussed; we haven't elaborated on that. But let me make clear that it's \u2013 when westop, this doesn't mean that our monetary policy stops being accommodating. The amount ofaccommodation will remain very significant, through our reinvestment policy and through our forwardguidance and interest rates.Your new economic forecasts suggest that inflation will hover around 1.7% for the next two anda bit years; is that consistent with these mandates and the decision to phase out QE?In relation to that: shouldn't the ECB be aiming for an overshoot on inflation rather than anundershoot given that it's been below target for so long?The answer to the first question is, yes, it's consistent. We have seen convergence and that's what thediscussion today confirms. We are seeing convergence of the inflation rate to our aim. We haveconfidence that this is happening, confidence based first and foremost on our monetary policy, whichremains accommodative and second, on the underlying strength of the economy. The ever-improvingconditions of the labour market - we\u2019ll maybe elaborate on that. But certainly the last number is alsoquite significant. The latest number about employment, it says that 9.2 million jobs have been createdin the euro area since 2013 and rising wages. We are confident that our present monetary policystance is consistent with our aim.11/23/23, 4:08 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2018/html/ecb.is180913.en.html 4/11Second point: our objective is an inflation rate which is below, but close to 2% over the medium term;we stay with that, that's our objective.I'd like to ask about whether or not there was any discussion \u2013 or even a discussion of whenyou will have a discussion \u2013 on the reinvestment policy.I'd also be interested in your personal view of this idea floating around of an \u201cOperation Twist\u201d-style operation that could perhaps be tailored to the needs of specific eurozone member states.Now, frankly we haven't discussed and we haven't \u2013 as I said last time, we haven't even discussedwhen we are going to discuss it. Now, having said that we have two meetings before year-end. So weeither discuss next time or in December. It's just a matter of \u2013 we'll take this decision in the comingdays, really. It was going to be at the level of committees first and foremost because it'll have to beprepared \u2013 properly prepared. Other than that, as you've seen from my reading, the reinvestmentstatement is exactly the same as before.Now, we haven't discussed either the \u201cOperation Twist\u201d or whether to reinvest in different maturities. Ithink what I said last time \u2013 and I can confirm that even though we haven't discussed, I believe theGoverning Council would be pretty unanimous on that \u2013 is that the capital key will remain the guidingprinciple.Even if it looks open-ended, let's say that QE is about to end and there is growing confusion inItaly I think about what QE has been really all about. Some people think that QE is a sort ofsecurities markets programme and that the end of QE will mean that Italy in particular will beabandoned, left alone to fight against attacks of speculators. I don't know whether you want tocomment on what QE is really all about.It's actually a comment made on other occasions in different contexts. The mandate of the ECB isprice stability in the medium term. QE has been one of the tools we used to pursue this task. In thepast the ECB was asked: why are we keeping, for example, interest rates negative and we aredepriving the savers from their income? Or why are we hurting insurance companies, banks, throughlow interest rates? As always answered, the mandate of the ECB is not to protect bankers' profits orinsurance companies' profits. In this case, responding to your question, it's not to ensure thatgovernment deficits would be financed under all conditions. Our task is to pursue price stability.You've mentioned increasing risks concerning emerging markets. The currency crises inArgentina and Turkey seem to have contagion effects on other emerging markets. How much ofa threat is that for the eurozone economy and the world economy?The current problems in the emerging markets seem to be related at least partly also to thetightening of monetary policy in the US and the withdrawal of liquidity. The ECB alsoanticipates to stop net purchases next year. What kind of risks do you expect when the twomain central banks reduce liquidity?Well, considering the first questions, the increased uncertainties in some emerging markets is certainlyone factor that adds to the general uncertainty in world markets. But having said that, so far thespillovers from Turkey and Argentina to other countries have not been substantial. Once again aswe've seen two or three years ago with similar crises in emerging markets, once again it is shown thatthe countries that are most vulnerable to contagion are the countries which have the weakest", "42": "11/23/23, 3:55 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190912~658eb51d68.en.html 1/12INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEMario Draghi, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-Presidentof the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 12 September 2019Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have conducted a thorough assessmentof the economic and inflation outlook, also taking into account the latest staff macroeconomicprojections for the euro area. As a result, the Governing Council took the following decisions in pursuitof its price stability objective.First, as regards the key ECB interest rates, we decided to lower the interest rate on the depositfacility by 10 basis points to -0.50%. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the rateon the marginal lending facility will remain unchanged at their current levels of 0.00% and 0.25%respectively. We now expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels untilwe have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2%within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlyinginflation dynamics.Second, the Governing Council decided to restart net purchases under its asset purchase programme(APP) at a monthly pace of \u20ac20 billion as from 1 November. We expect them to run for as long asnecessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before westart raising the key ECB interest rates.Third, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the keyECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditionsand an ample degree of monetary accommodation.Fourth, we decided to change the modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer-termrefinancing operations (TLTRO III) to preserve favourable bank lending conditions, ensure the smoothtransmission of monetary policy and further support the accommodative stance of monetary policy.The interest rate in each operation will now be set at the level of the average rate applied in theEurosystem\u2019s main refinancing operations over the life of the respective TLTRO. For banks whoseeligible net lending exceeds a benchmark, the rate applied in TLTRO III operations will be lower, andcan be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of theoperation. The maturity of the operations will be extended from two to three years.Fifth, in order to support the bank-based transmission of monetary policy the Governing Councildecided to introduce a two-tier system for reserve remuneration in which part of banks\u2019 holdings ofexcess liquidity will be exempt from the negative deposit facility rate.Jump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 3:55 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190912~658eb51d68.en.html 2/12Separate press releases with further details of the measures taken by the Governing Council will bepublished this afternoon at 15:30 CET.The Governing Council reiterated the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for aprolonged period of time and continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, toensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment tosymmetry.Today\u2019s decisions were taken in response to the continued shortfall of inflation with respect to our aim.In fact, incoming information since the last Governing Council meeting indicates a more protractedweakness of the euro area economy, the persistence of prominent downside risks and mutedinflationary pressures. This is reflected in the new staff projections, which show a further downgrade ofthe inflation outlook.At the same time, robust employment growth and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilienceof the euro area economy. With today\u2019s comprehensive package of monetary policy decisions, we areproviding substantial monetary stimulus to ensure that financial conditions remain very favourable andsupport the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, thesustained convergence of inflation to our medium-term inflation aim.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro areareal GDP increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2019, following a rise of0.4% in the previous quarter. Incoming economic data and survey information continue to point tomoderate but positive growth in the third quarter of this year. This slowdown in growth mainly reflectsthe prevailing weakness of international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties,which are particularly affecting the euro area manufacturing sector.At the same time, the services and construction sectors show ongoing resilience and the euro areaexpansion is also supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and risingwages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing \u2013 albeit somewhat slower \u2013growth in global activity.This assessment is broadly reflected in the September 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections forthe euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.1% in 2019, 1.2% in 2020and 1.4% in 2021. Compared with the June 2019 staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for realGDP growth has been revised down for 2019 and 2020.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside. These risks mainlypertain to the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat ofprotectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.According to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.0% in August 2019,unchanged from July. Lower energy inflation was offset by higher food inflation, while the rate of HICPinflation excluding food and energy was unchanged. On the basis of current futures prices for oil,headline inflation is likely to decline before rising again towards the end of the year. Measures ofunderlying inflation remained generally muted and indicators of inflation expectations stand at lowlevels. While labour cost pressures strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacityutilisation and tightening labour markets, their pass-through to inflation is taking longer than previously11/23/23, 3:55 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190912~658eb51d68.en.html 3/12anticipated. Over the medium term underlying inflation is expected to increase, supported by ourmonetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and robust wage growth.This assessment is also broadly reflected in the September 2019 ECB staff macroeconomicprojections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.2% in 2019, 1.0% in 2020 and1.5% in 2021. Compared with the June 2019 staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICPinflation has been revised down over the whole projection horizon, reflecting lower energy prices andthe weaker growth environment.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth increased to 5.2% in July 2019, after4.5% in June. Sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for theprivate sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continuesto be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side.The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations remained unchanged at 3.9% in July2019. The annual growth rate of overall loans to non-financial corporations continues to be solid,although short-term loans \u2013 which are more sensitive to the cycle \u2013 show signs of weakness. Theannual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.4% in July, after 3.3% in June, continuing itsgradual improvement. Overall, loan growth is still benefiting from historically low bank lending rates.The monetary policy measures we have taken today, including the more accommodative terms of thenew series of TLTROs, will help to safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue tosupport access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary forthe continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over themedium term.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contributemore decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential, supporting aggregate demand at thecurrent juncture and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural policies in euro areacountries needs to be substantially stepped up to boost euro area productivity and growth potential,reduce structural unemployment and increase resilience. The 2019 country-specific recommendationsshould serve as the relevant signpost.Regarding fiscal policies, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance is currently providing somesupport to economic activity. In view of the weakening economic outlook and the continuedprominence of downside risks, governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timelymanner. In countries where public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudent policies that willcreate the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely. All countries should reinforce theirefforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances.Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the European Union\u2019s fiscal and economicgovernance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience ofthe euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority.The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps tocomplete the banking union and the capital markets union.11/23/23, 3:55 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190912~658eb51d68.en.html 4/12We are now at your disposal for questions.* * *Good afternoon Mr President.President Draghi: Good afternoon.The question, my first question would be about the dynamic in the room because going into themeeting we\u2019ve seen quite a vocal opposition, especially to the restarting of the QE, so probablyme and the others here would like to know how much support each of the instruments thatwere eventually adopted got and whether, how much support was there for it? My secondquestion is specifically about your Asset Purchase Programme (APP) because it\u2019s effectively aprogramme that\u2019s open-ended, it starts from November which basically means you will end upbuying bonds or assets for months or years, the question is do you have the space to do it,have you considered changing limits or adding other assets to the programme? Thank you.President Draghi: Thank you. If I can, before giving you the sort of the chemistry of the meeting let mejust spend a word trying to explain what we have actually done. I think as I kind of sketched in theIntroductory Statement there were three elements that prompted action. Along the lines, by the way,that you would find in my Sintra speech. First of all after, and again if anything after Sintra the casebecame even stronger because the protracted slowdown in the eurozone economy is actually moremarked than expected, this is the first element. The second element is the persistent and thepersistence of downside risks of trade nature but also geo-political nature in the eurozone. And by theway our baseline scenario that actually contains the third reason for acting, namely the downwardrevision in projected inflation with the inflation expectations at this low level and the current underlyinginflation being muted. This baseline scenario is also relatively favourable because it doesn\u2019t containthe case of a hard Brexit for example, the probability of which has gone up over recent time, and itdoesn\u2019t contain some of the trade measures, trade escalation at least, some of the trade escalationthat\u2019s taken place since August. So with this relatively favourable baseline scenario there was adowngrade in inflation and inflation expectations. And so that\u2019s over the whole horizon. And that\u2019s whatprompted the measures we\u2019ve taken and let me just spend a word explaining them and then I willanswer your points more specifically. First of all, the lowering of the DFR, the Deposit Facility Rate,together with the reinforced forward guidance operates all throughout the yield curve, especially in theshort- and the medium-term segments. And then you see that there is a different forward guidancetoday, it\u2019s a strengthened state-dependence, there is no more calendar-dependence and this shouldgive a pretty good guidepost, pretty clear guidepost for rate expectations by linking our policy to morestringent conditions for the inflation outlook. Over our projection horizon, projected inflation will not onlyneed now to converge but also as I think I read in the Introductory Statement, also stabilise around alevel sufficiently close to but below 2%. The reference to levels sufficiently close to but below 2%signals that we want to see projected inflation to significantly increase from the current realised andprojected inflation figures which are well below the levels that we consider to be in line with our aim.Our guidance would remain forward-looking but at the same time it contains elements that protect usagainst the risk of over-reacting to transitory shocks to inflation as well as against forecast andmeasurement errors, as we would emphasise that convergence should be robust, that\u2019s important, andalso important is the reference to underlying inflation that will have to increase to ensure that the pick-", "43": "11/23/23, 4:07 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200910~5c43e3a591.en.html 1/12INTRODUCT ORY STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 10 September 2020Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council, whichwas also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.The incoming data since our last monetary policy meeting in July suggest a strong rebound in activitybroadly in line with previous expectations, although the level of activity remains well below the levelsprevailing before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. While activity in the manufacturing sector hascontinued to improve, momentum in the services sector has slowed somewhat recently. The strengthof the recovery remains surrounded by significant uncertainty, as it continues to be highly dependenton the future evolution of the pandemic and the success of containment policies. Euro area domesticdemand has recorded a significant recovery from low levels, although elevated uncertainty about theeconomic outlook continues to weigh on consumer spending and business investment. Headlineinflation is being dampened by low energy prices and weak price pressures in the context of subdueddemand and significant labour market slack.Against this background, ample monetary stimulus remains necessary to support the economicrecovery and to safeguard medium-term price stability. Therefore, we decided to reconfirm ouraccommodative monetary policy stance.We will keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present orlower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to,but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected inunderlying inflation dynamics.We will continue our purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with atotal envelope of \u20ac1,350 billion. These purchases contribute to easing the overall monetary policystance, thereby helping to offset the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path ofinflation. The purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across assetclasses and among jurisdictions. This allows us to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmissionof monetary policy. We will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until at least the end of June2021 and, in any case, until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. Wewill reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at leastthe end of 2022. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoidinterference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.Net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of \u20ac20billion, together with the purchases under the additional \u20ac120 billion temporary envelope until the endJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 4:07 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200910~5c43e3a591.en.html 2/12of the year. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long asnecessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before westart raising the key ECB interest rates. We intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principalpayments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past thedate when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary tomaintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.We will also continue to provide ample liquidity through our refinancing operations. In particular, thelatest operation in the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) hasregistered a very high take-up of funds, supporting bank lending to firms and households.The monetary policy measures that we have taken since early March are providing crucial support tounderpin the recovery of the euro area economy and to safeguard medium-term price stability. Inparticular, they support liquidity and funding conditions in the economy, help to sustain the flow ofcredit to households and firms, and contribute to maintaining favourable financing conditions for allsectors and jurisdictions. At the same time, in the current environment of elevated uncertainty, theGoverning Council will carefully assess incoming information, including developments in the exchangerate, with regard to its implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. It continues to stand ready toadjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in asustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro areareal GDP contracted by 11.8%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2020. Incoming data andsurvey results indicate a continued recovery of the euro area economy and point to a strong reboundin GDP growth in the third quarter. Alongside a significant rebound in industrial and servicesproduction, there are signs of a notable recovery in consumption. Recently, momentum has slowed inthe services sector compared with the manufacturing sector, which is also visible in survey results forAugust. The increases in coronavirus infection rates during the summer months constitute headwindsto the short-term outlook. Looking ahead, a further sustained recovery remains highly dependent onthe evolution of the pandemic and the success of containment policies. While the uncertainty related tothe evolution of the pandemic will likely dampen the strength of the recovery in the labour market andin consumption and investment, the euro area economy should be supported by favourable financingconditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a strengthening in global activity and demand.This assessment is broadly reflected in the September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections forthe euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP growth at \u2011 8.0% in 2020, 5.0% in 2021 and3.2% in 2022. Compared with the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlookfor real GDP growth has been revised up for 2020 and is largely unchanged for 2021 and 2022.Given the exceptional uncertainty currently surrounding the outlook, the projections include twoalternative scenarios, which we will publish on our website following this press conference. Overall, thebalance of risks to the euro area growth outlook is seen to remain on the downside. This assessmentlargely reflects the still uncertain economic and financial implications of the pandemic.According to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation decreased to \u2011 0.2% in August,from 0.4% in July. On the basis of current and futures prices for oil and taking into account thetemporary reduction in the German VAT rate, headline inflation is likely to remain negative over the11/23/23, 4:07 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200910~5c43e3a591.en.html 3/12coming months before turning positive again in early 2021. Moreover, in the near term price pressureswill remain subdued owing to weak demand, lower wage pressures and the appreciation of the euroexchange rate, despite some upward price pressures related to supply constraints. Over the mediumterm, a recovery in demand, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, will putupward pressure on inflation. Market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations havereturned to their pre-pandemic levels, but still remain very subdued, while survey-based measuresremain at low levels.This assessment is broadly reflected in the September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections forthe euro area, which foresee annual inflation at 0.3% in 2020, 1.0% in 2021 and 1.3% in 2022.Compared with the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for inflation isunchanged for 2020, has been revised up for 2021, and is unchanged for 2022. The unchangedprojection for inflation in 2022 masks an upward revision to inflation excluding energy and food \u2013 inpart reflecting the positive impact of the monetary and fiscal policy measures \u2013 which was largelyoffset by the revised path of energy prices.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth continued to rise, reaching 10.2% in July2020, after 9.2% in June. Strong money growth reflects domestic credit creation and the ongoing assetpurchases by the Eurosystem, as well as precautionary considerations which foster a heightenedpreference for liquidity in the money-holding sector. In this environment, the narrow monetaryaggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the main contributor tobroad money growth.Developments in loans to the private sector continued to be shaped by the impact of the coronaviruson economic activity. Following strong increases in the early months of the pandemic, the annualgrowth rate of loans to non-financial corporations remained broadly stable in July, standing at 7.0%,compared with 7.1% in June. High rates of corporate loan growth continue to mirror elevated liquidityneeds of firms to finance their ongoing expenditures and working capital and to further build liquiditybuffers, although the rebound in economic activity has resulted in some recovery in their revenues.The annual growth rate of loans to households also remained stable at 3.0% in July \u2013 the same rate asobserved since April 2020. Growth in loans to the private sector continues to benefit from historicallylow bank lending rates.Overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments andEuropean institutions, will continue to support access to financing, including for those most affected bythe ramifications of the pandemic.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from themonetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary for therobust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of thesharp contraction in the euro area economy. Fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemicemergency should as much as possible be targeted and temporary in nature. The three safety netsendorsed by the European Council for workers, businesses and sovereigns, amounting to a total of\u20ac540 billion, provide important funding support in this context. The Governing Council also stronglywelcomes the Next Generation EU package of \u20ac750 billion, which has the potential to significantly11/23/23, 4:07 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2020/html/ecb.is200910~5c43e3a591.en.html 4/12support the regions and sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, strengthen the Single Market and build alasting and prosperous recovery.In order to fully reach its potential, the package will need to be firmly rooted in sound structuralpolicies conceived and implemented at the national level. Well-designed structural policies couldcontribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery from the crisis, thereby supporting theeffectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area. Targeted structural policies are particularly importantto revitalise our economies, with a focus on boosting investment in priority areas such as the greenand digital transitions.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *President Lagarde, your words indicate to me that the exchange rate was a topic of discussionin the Governing Council today, so could you give me a bit of detail about that discussion?How concerned are you about the current level of the euro? Do you think this strength isjustified and how much does this affect the policy?A second question is about whether you discussed any change to any of your policies, whetherit's the PEPP or APP, TLTRO, tiering, was there any change being discussed today?Lagarde: Yes, indeed the Governing Council discussed the appreciation of the euro but as you know,we do not target the exchange rate. Our mandate is price stability and clearly to the extent that theappreciation of the euro exercises a negative pressure on prices, we have to monitor carefully such amatter. This was indeed extensively discussed during our Governing Council.On your second question concerning changes to our programmes, we as always look at how effectiveand efficient our policies are and our purchase programmes have been. So when we look at the impactthat a programme like the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme has been, we can onlyacknowledge the fact that it has been efficient and it has been effective. Whether you look at thesovereign yields across the euro area, whether you look at all indicators of fragmentation, you can \u2013and we can \u2013 and we certainly did take stock of the fact that it has worked in relation to bothstabilisation of financing conditions and in respect of the risk of fragmentation. In addition to that,clearly in terms of monetary stance we also acknowledge the fact that PEPP has also served itspurpose, although initially it was not intended for that particular aspect of our monetary policy, but itdid. So we decided to maintain our accommodative monetary policy, and certainly under currentcircumstances it is very likely that the full envelope of PEPP will be used for the purpose of developingthose policies.I have two questions. The first is on PEPP. The ECB does not fix the size of its net purchasesprogrammes in relation to the size of government bond issuance. However what you called theambitious fiscal measures in response to coronavirus pandemic by the euro area memberstates will result this year and next year in a massive increase in debt-to-GDP levels, addingpressure on debt sustainability in some countries. Are you and the Governing Council worriedthat public debt increases might jeopardise financial stability and provoke unwantedtightening, higher yields and spreads? So in that sense, the market suspects the PEPP to beincreased and what do you think about market expectations on that front?", "44": "11/23/23, 3:52 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210909~b2d882f724.en.html 1/12MONET ARY POLICY  STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 9 September 2021Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.The rebound phase in the recovery of the euro area economy is increasingly advanced. Output isexpected to exceed its pre-pandemic level by the end of the year. With more than 70 per cent ofEuropean adults fully vaccinated, the economy has largely reopened, allowing consumers to spendmore and companies to increase production. While rising immunity to the coronavirus means that theimpact of the pandemic is now less severe, the global spread of the Delta variant could yet delay thefull reopening of the economy. The current increase in inflation is expected to be largely temporary andunderlying price pressures are building up only slowly. The inflation outlook in our new staff projectionshas been revised slightly upwards, but in the medium term inflation is foreseen to remain well belowour two per cent target.Financing conditions for firms, households and the public sector have remained favourable since ourprevious quarterly assessment in June. Favourable financing conditions are essential for the economyto continue its recovery and to offset the negative impact of the pandemic on inflation.Based on a joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Counciljudges that favourable financing conditions can be maintained with a moderately lower pace of netasset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) than in the previoustwo quarters.We also confirmed our other measures, namely the level of the key ECB interest rates, our forwardguidance on their likely future evolution, our purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP),our reinvestment policies and our longer-term refinancing operations, as detailed in the published at 13:45 today. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensurethat inflation stabilises at our two per cent target over the medium term.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing, and then talk aboutour assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityThe economy rebounded by 2.2 per cent in the second quarter of the year, which was more thanexpected. It is on track for strong growth in the third quarter. The recovery builds on the success of thevaccination campaigns in Europe, which have allowed a significant reopening of the economy.Jump to the transcript of the questions and answerspress release11/23/23, 3:52 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210909~b2d882f724.en.html 2/12With the lifting of restrictions, the services sector is benefiting from people returning to shops andrestaurants and from the rebound in travel and tourism. Manufacturing is performing strongly, eventhough production continues to be held back by shortages of materials and equipment. The spread ofthe Delta variant has so far not required lockdown measures to be reimposed. But it could slow therecovery in global trade and the full reopening of the economy.Consumer spending is increasing, although consumers remain somewhat cautious in the light of thepandemic developments. The labour market is also improving rapidly, which holds out the prospect ofhigher incomes and greater spending. Unemployment is declining and the number of people in jobretention schemes has fallen by about 28 million from the peak last year. The recovery in domestic andglobal demand is further boosting optimism among firms, which is supporting business investment.At the same time, there remains some way to go before the damage to the economy caused by thepandemic is overcome. There are still more than two million fewer people employed than before thepandemic, especially among the younger and lower skilled. The number of workers in job retentionschemes also remains substantial.To support the recovery, ambitious, targeted and coordinated fiscal policy should continue tocomplement monetary policy. In particular, the Next Generation EU programme will help ensure astronger and uniform recovery across euro area countries. It will also accelerate the green and digitaltransitions, support structural reforms and lift long-term growth.We expect the economy to rebound firmly over the medium term. Our new staff projections foreseeannual real GDP growth at 5.0 per cent in 2021, 4.6 per cent in 2022 and 2.1 per cent in 2023.Compared with our June staff projections, the outlook has improved for 2021 and is broadlyunchanged for 2022 and 2023.InflationInflation increased to 3.0 per cent in August. We expect inflation to rise further this autumn but todecline next year. This temporary upswing in inflation mainly reflects the strong increase in oil pricessince around the middle of last year, the reversal of the temporary VAT reduction in Germany, delayedsummer sales in 2020 and cost pressures that stem from temporary shortages of materials andequipment. In the course of 2022 these factors should ease or will fall out of the year-on-year inflationcalculation.Underlying inflation pressures have edged up. As the economy recovers further, and supported by ourmonetary policy measures, we expect underlying inflation to rise over the medium term. This increaseis expected to be only gradual, since it will take time for the economy to return to operating at fullcapacity, and therefore wages are expected to grow only moderately. Measures of longer-term inflationexpectations have continued to increase, but these remain some distance from our two per cent target.The new staff projections foresee annual inflation at 2.2 per cent in 2021, 1.7 per cent in 2022 and 1.5per cent in 2023, being revised up compared with the previous projections in June. Inflation excludingfood and energy price inflation is projected to average 1.3 per cent in 2021, 1.4 per cent in 2022 and1.5 per cent in 2023, also being revised up from the June projections.11/23/23, 3:52 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210909~b2d882f724.en.html 3/12Risk assessmentWe see the risks to the economic outlook as broadly balanced. Economic activity could outperform ourexpectations if consumers become more confident and save less than currently expected. A fasterimprovement in the pandemic situation could also lead to a stronger expansion than currentlyenvisaged. If supply bottlenecks last longer and feed through into higher than anticipated wage rises,price pressures could be more persistent. At the same time, the economic outlook could deteriorate ifthe pandemic worsens, which could delay the further reopening of the economy, or if supply shortagesturn out to be more persistent than currently expected and hold back production.Financial and monetary conditionsThe recovery of growth and inflation still depends on favourable financing conditions for all sectors ofthe economy. Market interest rates have eased over the summer, but reversed recently. Overall,financing conditions for the economy remain favourable.Bank lending rates for firms and households are at historically low levels. Lending to households isholding up, especially for house purchases. The somewhat slower growth of lending to firms is mainlydue to the fact that firms are still well funded, because they borrowed heavily in the first wave of thepandemic. They have high cash holdings and are increasingly retaining earnings, which reduces theneed for external funding. For larger firms, issuing bonds is an attractive alternative to bank loans.Solid bank balance sheets continue to ensure that sufficient credit is available.However, many firms and households have taken on more debt during the pandemic. A deterioration inthe economic outlook could threaten their financial health. This, in turn, would worsen the quality ofbanks\u2019 balance sheets. Policy support remains essential to prevent balance sheet strains andtightening financing conditions from reinforcing each other.ConclusionSumming up, the euro area economy is clearly rebounding. However, the speed of the recoverycontinues to depend on the course of the pandemic and progress with vaccinations. The current rise ininflation is expected to be largely temporary and underlying price pressures will build up only gradually.The slight improvement in the medium-term inflation outlook and the current level of financingconditions allow favourable financing conditions to be maintained with a moderately lower pace of netasset purchases under the PEPP. Our policy measures, including our revised forward guidance on thekey ECB interest rates, are key to helping the economy shift to a sustained recovery and, ultimately, tobringing inflation to our two per cent target.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *I had two questions. The first was on the pace, on the discussion around reducing assetpurchases. Some of your Council members have suggested that they would like to see theprogramme, the Pandemic Emergency Purchasing Programme (PEPP) coming to an end soon.Would you characterise this, or did you characterise this internally, as a taper, or is it a turningpoint, or how would you characterise the move? And the second question was, why you feel11/23/23, 3:52 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210909~b2d882f724.en.html 4/12confident enough to do this? Your 2023 outlook for inflation is 1.5 per cent, which is some waybelow your medium-term target. There also seems to be a lot of uncertainty in the globaleconomy around Delta, around slowdown in China. So, why did you think reducing yourstimulus was the correct move? Thank you.Lagarde: Well, thank you so much for your questions. I would preface my response to your firstquestion by a quote, actually, in a way, which is, the lady isn\u2019t tapering. Because what we are doing isrecalibrating PEPP, which I\u2019ll remind you is the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, and weare recalibrating just as we did back in December and back in March. We are doing that on the basisof the framework, which is a joint assessment, so we look at the financing conditions, and weconcluded that they remain favourable, and we do that on the basis on the inflation outlook. And asyou rightly pointed out, our inflation outlook has been upgraded, and it has been the case for \u201921,significantly, \u201922, quite significantly, and to a lesser extent, \u201923. But across the board, you have animprovement on the inflation numbers for the whole horizon that we look at. We also look at otherindicators, and on those accounts as well, there has been a significant improvement of the inflationnumbers, both for \u201922 and \u201923. So, on the basis of that joint assessment, and because we know thatwe need to keep favourable financing conditions, this is the commitment that we have and this is whatwe agreed in December. That hasn\u2019t varied. We believe that we can maintain those favourablefinancing conditions with a moderately lower pace of purchase, and, of course, the choice of words isrelevant. It is moderately lower than what we have done in Q2 and Q3. Are we confident enough?Well, you know, the September meeting is conducted in the light of our projections, and what we areseeing is clearly an improvement on many fronts. The output numbers are much higher. The inflationnumbers have been upgraded as I\u2019ve just indicated. The employment numbers have also improvedand the unemployment situation is serious, of course, but more benign than was anticipated. So, onthe basis of all that, and the success of the vaccination campaign, which we have all along said wascritically important to determine the economic recovery, we believe that the euro area economy isrebounding. And that gives us the confidence to take the measure that we have taken, which, as I said,is a recalibration of our Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme for the next three months.Thank you for the opportunity, and nice to see you on Webex. President Lagarde, I have twoquestions. My first question is on financing conditions. For how long will the ECB preservefavourable financing conditions, to support the recovery? Also after the COVID crisis, in asense, will favourable financing conditions end with the end of the Pandemic EmergencyPurchase Programme? And my second question is on PEPP. As the Coronavirus crisis enters anew phase as you have described, with the new Delta variant, but also a better economicoutlook and a good pace of vaccinations, can you tell us a bit more how the Governing Councilintends to judge and assess the end of the COVID crisis phase, given that PEPP will end whenthe COVID crisis phase is over? Thank you.Lagarde: Well, thank you very much, and it\u2019s very nice to see you as well. This is a significantimprovement from previous press conferences, so we\u2019re probably heading in the right direction here.The next step will be to actually see each other with appropriate distance between us. On thecommitment for favourable financing conditions, I\u2019ll remind you that that was decided at our GoverningCouncil meeting in December, under the auspices of the PEPP. So PEPP is an emergency", "45": "11/23/23, 3:57 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220908~cd8363c58e.en.html 1/12MONET ARY POLICY  STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 8 September 2022Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.The Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points. Thismajor step frontloads the transition from the prevailing highly accommodative level of policy ratestowards levels that will ensure the timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target.Based on our current assessment, over the next several meetings we expect to raise interest ratesfurther to dampen demand and guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflationexpectations. We will regularly re-evaluate our policy path in light of incoming information and theevolving inflation outlook. Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent andfollow a meeting-by-meeting approach.We took today\u2019s decision, and expect to raise interest rates further, because inflation remains far toohigh and is likely to stay above our target for an extended period. According to Eurostat\u2019s flashestimate, inflation reached 9.1 per cent in August. Soaring energy and food prices, demand pressuresin some sectors owing to the reopening of the economy, and supply bottlenecks are still driving upinflation. Price pressures have continued to strengthen and broaden across the economy and inflationmay rise further in the near term. As the current drivers of inflation fade over time and thenormalisation of our monetary policy works its way through to the economy and price-setting, inflationwill come down. Looking ahead, ECB staff have significantly revised up their inflation projections andinflation is now expected to average 8.1 per cent in 2022, 5.5 per cent in 2023 and 2.3 per cent in2024.After a rebound in the first half of 2022, recent data point to a substantial slowdown in euro areaeconomic growth, with the economy expected to stagnate later in the year and in the first quarter of2023. Very high energy prices are reducing the purchasing power of people\u2019s incomes and, althoughsupply bottlenecks are easing, they are still constraining economic activity. In addition, the adversegeopolitical situation, especially Russia\u2019s unjustified aggression towards Ukraine, is weighing on theconfidence of businesses and consumers. This outlook is reflected in the latest staff projections foreconomic growth, which have been revised down markedly for the remainder of the current year andthroughout 2023. Staff now expect the economy to grow by 3.1 per cent in 2022, 0.9 per cent in 2023and 1.9 per cent in 2024.The lasting vulnerabilities caused by the pandemic still pose a risk to the smooth transmission of ourmonetary policy. The Governing Council will therefore continue applying flexibility in reinvestingJump to the transcript of the questions and answers11/23/23, 3:57 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220908~cd8363c58e.en.html 2/12redemptions coming due in the pandemic emergency purchase programme portfolio, with a view tocountering risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.The decisions taken today are set out in a  available on our website. A separate technicalpress release on the remuneration of government deposits will be published at 15:45 CET.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explainour assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityThe euro area economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2022, mainly owing to strongconsumer spending on contact-intensive services, as a result of the lifting of pandemic-relatedrestrictions. Over the summer, as people travelled more, countries with large tourism sectors benefitedespecially. At the same time, businesses suffered from high energy costs and continued supplybottlenecks, although the latter have been gradually easing.While buoyant tourism has been supporting economic growth during the third quarter, we expect theeconomy to slow down substantially over the remainder of this year. There are four main reasonsbehind this. First, high inflation is dampening spending and production throughout the economy, andthese headwinds are reinforced by gas supply disruptions. Second, the strong rebound in demand forservices that came with the reopening of the economy will lose steam in the coming months. Third, theweakening in global demand, also in the context of tighter monetary policy in many major economies,and the worsening terms of trade will mean less support for the euro area economy. Fourth,uncertainty remains high and confidence is falling sharply.At the same time, the labour market has remained robust, supporting economic activity. Employmentincreased by more than 600,000 people in the second quarter of 2022 and the unemployment ratestood at a historical low of 6.6 per cent in July. Total hours worked increased further, by 0.6 per cent, inthe second quarter of 2022 and have surpassed their pre-pandemic levels. Looking ahead, the slowingeconomy is likely to lead to some increase in the unemployment rate.Fiscal support measures to cushion the impact of higher energy prices should be temporary andtargeted at the most vulnerable households and firms to limit the risk of fuelling inflationary pressures,to enhance the efficiency of public spending and to preserve debt sustainability. Structural policiesshould aim at raising the euro area\u2019s growth potential and supporting its resilience.InflationInflation rose further to 9.1 per cent in August. Energy price inflation remained extremely elevated, at38.3 per cent, and it was again the dominant component of overall inflation. Market-based indicatorssuggest that, in the near term, oil prices will moderate, while wholesale gas prices will stayextraordinarily high. Food price inflation also rose in August, to 10.6 per cent, partly reflecting higherinput costs related to energy, disruptions of trade in food commodities and adverse weather conditions.While supply bottlenecks have been easing, these continue to gradually feed through to consumerprices and are putting upward pressure on inflation, as is recovering demand in the services sector.The depreciation of the euro has also added to the build-up of inflationary pressures.press release11/23/23, 3:57 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220908~cd8363c58e.en.html 3/12Price pressures are spreading across more and more sectors, in part owing to the impact of highenergy costs across the whole economy. Accordingly, measures of underlying inflation remain atelevated levels and the latest staff projections see inflation excluding food and energy reaching 3.9 percent in 2022, 3.4 per cent in 2023 and 2.3 per cent in 2024.Resilient labour markets and some catch-up to compensate for higher inflation are likely to supportgrowth in wages. At the same time, incoming data and recent wage agreements indicate that wagedynamics remain contained overall. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currentlystand at around two per cent, although recent above-target revisions to some indicators warrantcontinued monitoring.Risk assessmentIn the context of the slowing global economy, risks to growth are primarily on the downside, inparticular in the near term. As reflected in the downside scenario in the staff projections, a long-lastingwar in Ukraine remains a significant risk to growth, especially if firms and households faced rationingof energy supplies. In such a situation, confidence could deteriorate further and supply-side constraintscould worsen again. Energy and food costs could also remain persistently higher than expected. Afurther deterioration in the global economic outlook could be an additional drag on euro area externaldemand.The risks to the inflation outlook are primarily on the upside. In the same way as for growth, the majorrisk in the short term is a further disruption of energy supplies. Over the medium term, inflation mayturn out to be higher than expected because of a persistent worsening of the production capacity of theeuro area economy, further increases in energy and food prices, a rise in inflation expectations aboveour target, or higher than anticipated wage rises. However, if energy costs were to decline or demandwere to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressures on prices.Financial and monetary conditionsMarket interest rates have increased in anticipation of further monetary policy normalisation inresponse to the inflation outlook. Credit to firms has become more expensive over recent months, andbank lending rates for households now stand at their highest levels in more than five years. In terms ofvolumes, bank lending to firms has so far remained strong, in part reflecting the need to finance highproduction costs and inventory building. Mortgage lending to households is moderating because oftightening credit standards, rising borrowing costs and weak consumer confidence.ConclusionSumming up, we raised the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points today, and expect to raiseinterest rates further, because inflation remains far too high and is likely to stay above our target for anextended period. This major step frontloads the transition from the prevailing highly accommodativelevel of policy rates towards levels that will support a timely return of inflation to our two per centmedium-term target.Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meetingapproach. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation11/23/23, 3:57 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220908~cd8363c58e.en.html 4/12returns to our medium-term inflation target.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *Could you give us a flavour of the Governing Council's discussions, the arguments for andagainst, that led to today's decision to raise rates by 75 basis points and not for example by 50or 100 basis points?Then my second question: from the present standpoint how close to both the neutral rate ofinterest and the expected terminal rate does today's decision bring us, in your view?I'll take them in turn. On your first question: the Governing Council unanimously decided to raise thethree key ECB rates by 75 basis points. We had different views around the table, a thoroughdiscussion but the outcome of our discussion was a unanimous decision. So how did we come to thatdecision? As I have said before, and as I have repeated in that monetary policy statement, since ourlast July meeting we are data dependent and operate meeting by meeting. This is the methodologythat we adopt. So we were presented by staff with their projection. We had the inflation numbers andthe growth outlook, of course. So in the face of these extremely high numbers \u2013 the last [inflation]reading was 9.1% [year-on-year] for a monthly reading, but if you look at the last ten readings, theywere the last ten highest readings in turn \u2013 we had a good analysis of the decomposition of thesources of inflation. A good analysis of where the inflation actually lies and what products areparticularly affected.Of course energy is still the major source of inflation \u2013 [energy price inflation is] 38.3% compared witha year ago \u2013 slightly moving down in these August numbers, but it is still a dominant factor, as is in theincrease in food. But we also have an inflation that spreads across the whole range of products inparticular in the service sector, where supply factors are less prevalent and where demand plays arole. So we have a range of products and services that are actually north of 4% [inflation rate]. In theface of an inflation that is extremely high, that is of a magnitude and persistence across sectors of thatnature, obviously determined action had to be taken. This is very much in line with our determination toactually normalise monetary policy as we started back in December. So for those who consistentlyrepeat that the European Central Bank is lagging behind, I contend that we are on a journey thatstarted back in December where we decided to put an end to the asset purchases, the PEPP and thenthe APP, to move out of negative interest rates as we did back in July and now to continue on ournormalisation path, with a frontloading exercise that we conducted today, because we believe that thedeviation from target is such that it warrants this frontloading. We also decided that this was not anisolated decision, but that we would raise interest rates further. We didn't say that we would raiseinterest rates by 75 [basis points], as if 75 was the norm; it is not. We will determine meeting bymeeting on the basis of data how we reach that level of interest rates which will actually return us tothe 2% target in the medium term. It is not there at the moment. Our forecast at the end of December[2024] \u2013 which is not the medium term but it's the end of our projection exercise \u2013 is at 2.3%. We arenot there, so we have more journey to cover going forward.You were interested in the flavour of the Governing Council meeting; we had a very cordial, effective,deep discussion on all these matters and that certainly helped us on the basis of the proposals by staff", "46": "11/23/23, 3:49 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230914~686786984a.en.html 1/11MONET ARY POLICY  STATEMENTPRESS CONFERENCEChristine Lagarde, President of the ECB,Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 14 September 2023Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.Inflation continues to decline but is still expected to remain too high for too long. We are determined toensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. In order toreinforce progress towards our target, the Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECBinterest rates by 25 basis points.The rate increase today reflects our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incomingeconomic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policytransmission. The September ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area see averageinflation at 5.6 per cent in 2023, 3.2 per cent in 2024 and 2.1 per cent in 2025. This is an upwardrevision for 2023 and 2024 and a downward revision for 2025. The upward revision for 2023 and 2024mainly reflects a higher path for energy prices. Underlying price pressures remain high, even thoughmost indicators have started to ease. ECB staff have slightly revised down the projected path forinflation excluding energy and food, to an average of 5.1 per cent in 2023, 2.9 per cent in 2024 and 2.2per cent in 2025. Our past interest rate increases continue to be transmitted forcefully. Financingconditions have tightened further and are increasingly dampening demand, which is an importantfactor in bringing inflation back to target. With the increasing impact of our tightening on domesticdemand and the weakening international trade environment, ECB staff have lowered their economicgrowth projections significantly. They now expect the euro area economy to expand by 0.7 per cent in2023, 1.0 per cent in 2024 and 1.5 per cent in 2025.Based on our current assessment, we consider that the key ECB interest rates have reached levelsthat, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely returnof inflation to our target. Our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be set atsufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary. We will continue to follow a data-dependentapproach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest ratedecisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economicand financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policytransmission.The decisions taken today are set out in a  available on our website.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explainour assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Jump to the transcript of the questions and answerspress release11/23/23, 3:49 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230914~686786984a.en.html 2/11Economic activityThe economy is likely to remain subdued in the coming months. It broadly stagnated over the first halfof the year, and recent indicators suggest it has also been weak in the third quarter. Lower demand forthe euro area\u2019s exports and the impact of tight financing conditions are dampening growth, includingthrough lower residential and business investment. The services sector, which had so far beenresilient, is now also weakening. Over time, economic momentum should pick up, as real incomes areexpected to rise, supported by falling inflation, rising wages and a strong labour market, and this willunderpin consumer spending.The labour market has so far remained resilient despite the slowing economy. The unemployment ratestayed at its historical low of 6.4 per cent in July. While employment grew by 0.2 per cent in the secondquarter, momentum is slowing. The services sector, which has been a major driver of employmentgrowth since mid-2022, is now also creating fewer jobs.As the energy crisis fades, governments should continue to roll back the related support measures.This is essential to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would otherwise call foran even stronger monetary policy response. Fiscal policies should be designed to make our economymore productive and to gradually bring down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area\u2019ssupply capacity \u2013 which would be supported by the full implementation of the Next Generation EUprogramme \u2013 can help reduce price pressures in the medium term, while supporting the greentransition. The reform of the EU\u2019s economic governance framework should be concluded before theend of this year and progress towards Capital Markets Union should be accelerated.InflationInflation declined to 5.3 per cent in July but remained at that level in August, according to Eurostat\u2019sflash estimate. Its decline was interrupted because energy prices rose compared with July. Food priceinflation has come down from its peak in March but was still almost 10 per cent in August. In thecoming months, the sharp price increases recorded in the autumn of 2022 will drop out of the yearlyrates, thus pulling inflation down.Inflation excluding energy and food fell to 5.3 per cent in August, from 5.5 per cent in July. Goodsinflation declined to 4.8 per cent in August, from 5.0 per cent in July and 5.5 per cent in June, owing tobetter supply conditions, previous drops in energy prices, easing price pressures in the earlier stagesof the production chain and weaker demand. Services inflation edged down to 5.5 per cent but was stillkept up by strong spending on holidays and travel and by the high growth of wages. The annualgrowth rate of compensation per employee remained constant at 5.5 per cent in the second quarter ofthe year. The contribution of labour costs to annual domestic inflation increased in the second quarter,in part owing to weaker productivity, while the contribution of profits fell for the first time since early2022.Most measures of underlying inflation are starting to fall as demand and supply have become morealigned and the contribution of past energy price increases is fading out. At the same time, domesticprice pressures remain strong.11/23/23, 3:49 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230914~686786984a.en.html 3/11Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around 2 per cent. But someindicators have increased and need to be monitored closely.Risk assessmentThe risks to economic growth are tilted to the downside. Growth could be slower if the effects ofmonetary policy are more forceful than expected, or if the world economy weakens, for instance owingto a further slowdown in China. Conversely, growth could be higher than projected if the strong labourmarket, rising real incomes and receding uncertainty mean that people and businesses become moreconfident and spend more.Upside risks to inflation include potential renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food.Adverse weather conditions, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could push food prices upby more than expected. A lasting rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher thananticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over themedium term. By contrast, weaker demand \u2013 for example due to a stronger transmission of monetarypolicy or a worsening of the economic environment outside the euro area \u2013 would lead to lower pricepressures, especially over the medium term.Financial and monetary conditionsOur monetary policy tightening continues to be transmitted strongly to broader financing conditions.Funding has again become more expensive for banks, as savers are replacing overnight deposits withtime deposits that pay more interest and the ECB\u2019s targeted longer-term refinancing operations arebeing phased out. Average lending rates for business loans and mortgages continued to increase inJuly, to 4.9 per cent and 3.8 per cent respectively.Credit dynamics have weakened further. Loans to firms grew at an annual rate of 2.2 per cent in July,down from 3.0 per cent in June. Loans to households also grew less strongly, by 1.3 per cent, after 1.7per cent in June. In annualised terms based on the last three months of data, household loansdeclined by 0.8 per cent, which is the strongest contraction since the start of the euro. Amid weaklending and the reduction in the Eurosystem balance sheet, the annual growth rate of M3 fell from 0.6per cent in June to an all-time low of -0.4 per cent in July. In annualised terms over the past threemonths, M3 contracted by 1.5 per cent.ConclusionInflation continues to decline but is still expected to remain too high for too long. We are determined toensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. In order toreinforce progress towards our target, the Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECBinterest rates by 25 basis points. Based on our current assessment, we consider that the key ECBinterest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make asubstantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to our target. Our future decisions will ensurethat the key ECB interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary. Wewill continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration ofrestriction.11/23/23, 3:49 PM PRESS CONFERENCEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230914~686786984a.en.html 4/11In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflationreturns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policytransmission.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *My first question is a general one. How did the discussion go? Because clearly before goinginto the meeting, there was much room for the so-called doves but also the hawks. So how didyou come to a compromise? And the second question. Is that a dovish hike, meaning that\u2019s itthe end of the rate hiking cycle now or do you leave the door open?So how did the discussion go? We had a lot of data, a lot of analysis done by staff and obviously thiswas a projection meeting and the projections were prepared by ECB staff. So we looked very closelyat all those data. And to give you an example, we spent hours and hours yesterday, morning andafternoon, with the usual presentation by staff in the morning and by the Chief Economist and themember of the Executive Board responsible for markets to have as much intelligence, numbers andanalysis as possible. And I'm pleased to say that at the end of this morning session, we came to theconclusion that we shared the analysis that was conducted, on GDP, on inflation, on anticipation. Andobviously some members did not draw the same conclusion and some governors would havepreferred to pause and reserve future decisions once more certainty, more intelligence would haveresulted from the passing of time and the impact of our many previous decisions. But I can tell you thatthere was a solid majority of the governors to agree with the decision that we have made and that Ihave just read to you. So yes, there are a few members in the Governing Council who would havepreferred a pause and we had to rely, as I told you, on a solid majority. It is not the practice to givenumbers of who did what and when, but suffice to say that the majority was solid. I don't want you tobelieve that we had an antagonistic adversarial discussion. We really went deep into the numbers andthe analysis, and tried to really take into account the sensitivity analysis, the scenarios that wereprovided by staff and we really discussed the baseline and the impact of our measures in the past. AndI am happy to go through the process that we followed in terms of reasoning.On your second question, is the door open or is the door closed? You know, there was a beautifultheatre play by De Marivaux, who said that a door has to be either opened or closed. But this istheatre. What we have decided is actually reflected in that key paragraph, which I have read twicebecause it is in the body of the text which was released to you earlier and also in the conclusion of thetext. And it has caveats: \u201cbased on our current assessment\u201d. So, it is based on all the data, thenumbers, the analysis, the assessment, the projections and any other information that we haveavailable. We considered that \u201cthe key ECB interest rates have reached levels\u201d \u2013 note, levels \u2013 \u201cthat,maintained for a sufficiently long duration\u201d \u2013 so there is the time element that comes up \u2013 \u201cwill make asubstantial contribution\u201d \u2013 substantial contribution, those are heavy words \u2013 \u201cto the timely return ofinflation to the target\u201d. And we don't stop here. The whole paragraph is important and needs to be readin symbiosis. So the next sentence says that \u201cour future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interestrates will be set at \u2013 one \u2013 \u201csufficiently restrictive levels\u201d \u2013 two \u2013 \u201cas long as necessary\u201d. Those arereally two parameters that are going to guide us very much. Not that we are forgetting about the threecomponents that have guided our reasoning so far. We will continue to follow a data-dependent"}
