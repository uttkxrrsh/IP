Over the last decade, the profile of central banks has gone up. First, we ha d the Great Moderation - a period of extraordinary benign macroeconomic e nvironment globally, characterized by steady growth in advanced economies and accelerated growth in emerging economies, and low and stable inflation a ll around. Central banks took credit for this, believed they had discovered th e Holy Grail and declared victory.  2. That sense of triumph was dented by the crisis as central banks came to be blamed for policies and actions that got the world into the crisis. Even so, central banks battled the crisis from the frontlines and regained some of the lost reputation by acting quickly, decisively, a nd where required in concert,  to stabilize the global economy which was hurtling towards collapse. Over the last few months, fears of a double-dip recession have resurfaced, and governments in advanced countries are locked in a policy logjam over the balance between short-term fiscal stimulus and long term fiscal consolidation. This has willy-nilly pushed central banks to the fore once again as monetary stimulus is having to  bear the burden of being the first, and in some cases, possibly the only li ne of defence against recession.                                                   1 Comments of  Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Stern School of Business, New York University, September 26, 2011. 3. The crisis has been an intellectual challenge in many ways. It has tested the armoury of instruments available to centr al banks and the limits of their policy force. It has also reopened questions that we thought had been answered and renewed debates that we thought had been settled. My own experience has been that real world problems are too complex to fit templa te solution of text books. I want to use this opportunity that you ha ve provided me to communicate to you some of the complexities and dilemmas in real world policy making, and I will do so from the perspective of th e Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  What is the appropriate mo netary policy response to complex growth-inflation dynamics?  4. India recovered from the crisis soone r than even other emerging economies, but inflation too caught up with us sooner th an elsewhere. Inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), which act ually went into negative territory for a brief period in mid-2009, started rising in  late 2009, and it has remained around 9-10 per cent since January 2010 reflecting both supply and demand pressures. Supply pressures stemmed fr om elevated domestic food prices and rising global prices of oil and other commodities. The source of demand pressures was an economy with low per capita income which recovered sharply from the crisis. The supply pressures and demand pressures collided triggering a wider inflationary process.  5. In response to the inflat ionary pressures, the Reserve Bank began to reverse its accommodative monetary policy as ear ly as October 2009. We have been criticized for our anti-inflationary stance,  ironically from two different directions. From one side, we have been critici zed for being hawkish on inflation. The argument has been that our inflation is driven largely by supply shocks, particularly, since mid-2010, by high oil and other commodity prices, and that monetary policy should not respond to such  inflation. We will only end up hurting growth. The criticism from the other side has been that the Reserve Bank has been soft on inflation, the baby step approach we followed - of increasing policy interest rates by 25 bp each time - was not deterrent  enough, and that the persistence of inflation is a result of our delayed response.  Both these critiques cannot obviously be right at the same time. Let me offe r a response to them and in the process explain the rationale for our  anti-inflationary stance.  Monetary Policy Too Hawkish 6. My response to the doves is as follows. Admittedly, monetary policy is best suited to contain inflationary pressures stemming from the aggregate demand side. In that case, the policy pres cription is clear. If infla tion is high, tighten monetary policy; and if inflation is low, loosen monetary policy. Monetary policy options in the face of supply shocks ar e less straight forward. Wh ether monetary policy is effective in dealing with supply shocks  is therefore a ma tter of both academic debate and policy contention.   7. The conventional wisdom is that if inflation expectations  are well anchored, monetary policy need not react to suppl y shocks. This premise is based on two assumptions; first that the supply shocks are purely temporary, and second that supply shocks are the only ones driving in flation. These assumptions do not always hold. In the real world, oftentimes supply shocks lead to a permanent trend upward shift in prices. Also, sometimes, demand pressures combine with supply shocks to stoke inflationary pressures.   8. A good illustration of the first assumption - mean reverting supply shocks - not holding comes from the world prices of oil whic h have trended up on a long period basis. International crude oil prices  recorded an annual average increase of around 17 per cent during the 2000s as agains t only a modest increase of 2 per cent during the 1990s and a decline of 3 per cen t during the 1980s. This obviously is the outcome of structural changes in supply and demand for oil. Monetary policy has to recognize these underlying tren ds and respond to them. If it looks upon these trends as pure transient supply shocks and ignores them, it runs the risk of destabilizing inflation expectations.  9. And now about the second assumption - of supply shocks not usually acting alone to stoke inflation. The shifting driver s of inflation in India over the past year and a half offer a good illustration. The increase in global commodity prices coincided with rapidly rising demand at ho me. GDP grew at 8.5 per cent last year (2010/11), faster than the trend growth rate  which is now estimated to be of the order of 8 per cent. In an environment of  rapid growth and hi gh capacity utilization, corporates regained pricing power and were able to pass th rough the increase in input prices to higher output prices thus fu elling generalized inflationary pressures.   10. Similar dynamics were at play on the food front. Rising incomes, especially in rural areas, have resulted in a shift in dietary habits away from cereals and toward protein-based foods. This is a stru ctural change and monetary policy will be misled if it treats this as  a one-off supply shock. Given the high share of food in the various consumer price indices (46% - 70%), persistent supply pressures on the food front can fuel inflation expectati ons; and in the face of growing demand pressures, rising inflation expectations can trigger a wage-price spiral. Recent reports that real wages of rural labour have gone up mark edly suggest that such a wage-price spiral may already be under way.  11. To summarize, the inflation that we have experienced over the last nearly twenty months is a result of a combination of supply shocks that had a trend impact on prices as well as demand pressures. Give n the nature of the inflation drivers and their combined impact, clearly there is a significant role for monetary policy in combating inflation. Our monetary policy stance is guided by this understanding, and is aimed at restraining demand a nd anchoring inflation expectations. The argument of our critics that monetary policy has no role because inflation is a result of imported commodity prices would have b een valid if the increase in commodity prices was a pure and transien t supply shock or if there were no demand pressures. That clearly was not the case in India.   Monetary Tightening Hurts Growth 12. Another argument made in this line of criticism is that monetary policy tightening is hurting growth. I believe a much more nuanced evaluation of our policy stance is necessary. Evidence from empirical research suggests that the relationship between growth and inflation is  non-linear. At low in flation and stable inflation expectations, there is a trade-o ff between growth and inflation. But above a certain threshold level of  inflation, this relationshi p reverses, the trade-off disappears, and high inflation actually st arts taking a toll on growth. Estimates by the Reserve Bank using differe nt methodologies put the thre shold level of inflation in the range of 4% - 6%. With WPI inflation ruling above 9 per cent, we are way past the threshold. At this high level, inflation is unambiguously inimical to growth; it saps investor confidence and er odes medium term growth prospects. The Reserve Bank’s monetary tightening is accordingly geared towards safeguarding medium term growth even if it means so me sacrifice in near term growth.   Monetary Policy Behind the Curve  13. Now let me turn to the criticism fr om the opposite side - that the Reserve Bank was slow in closing the monetary spig ots, that our ‘baby step’ approach was inadequate to tame the inflationary pre ssures, and that we are having to tighten aggressively lately to make up for lost time.   14. This criticism fails to appreciate the context - the nature of domestic inflation and global uncertainty - in which we were operating. The calibration of our monetary tightening was guided by the changing drivers of inflation over the course of fiscal year 2010/11. Early on in the year, inflation pressures had their origin in food prices, and accordingly our  monetary policy response was aimed at containing the spillover risk to non-food inflation. Note that policy rates had gone down to historically low levels during the crisis, and an abrupt  adjustment would have disrupted the market. Our judgement, therefore, was that tightening should be done gradually, in small steps, so as to allow time for the banks and the private sector to adjust to a higher interest rate environment.   15. The inflation scenario change d starting August 2010 when global commodity prices surged higher than anticipated. Global oil prices came under further pressure starting January 2011 because of political developments in the Middle East and North-Africa. Also, as I had indicated earlier, because of the narrowing of the output gap, producers were able to pass on higher input prices to higher output prices leading to inflati onary pressures getting generalized as evidenced by the increase in non-food ma nufactured product inflation from 5.3 per cent per cent in August 2010 to  8.5 per cent in March 2011. We responded to these changes in underlying drivers of inflation by tightening more aggressively starting May 2011.   16. The second factor relevant in the ‘behi nd the curve’ debate is that we also had to contend with an uncertain global recovery. Even as there was some talk of spring shoots in April 2010, the optimism di d not last; soon thereafter, the Greek sovereign debt crisis and unemployment concerns in the US revived concerns about the pace and shape of global recovery. These uncertainties increased both in nature and size as time passed with the euro area sovereign debt problem not only spreading but proving to be intractable, th e US recovery stalli ng and the Japanese economy assaulted by an unprecedented natural disaster. Our ‘baby step’ approach during 2010 was accordingly a delicate balancing act between supporting recovery at home amidst growing global uncertainty  and containing inflation pressures.   17. If the above factors are reckoned w ith, the ‘behind-the-curve’ argument loses potency. Starting in March 2010, we ha ve so far raised policy interest rates (the repo rate) by 350 bp. The effective ti ghtening has been even more, 500 bp, as the operational policy rate shifted from reve rse repo rate (absorption mode) to repo rate (infusion mode).   18. In offering a response to the criticis m of our monetary policy stance from both sides, my endeavour has been to co mmunicate to you th at every monetary policy action involves complex judgement. Th e supply shocks we confront in the real world are different from pure text book versions; oftentimes they coincide with rising demand pressures. We have to bala nce growth-inflation concerns. On top of that, monetary policy actions need to be forward looking even in the face of external uncertainty. This in essence is the dilemma of moneta ry policy decisions.   How do you justify liquidity injection in the midst of a tightening cycle? 19. The conventional tools of monetary po licy are controls over the volume of money (liquidity) and the price of money (policy intere st rate). Typically an expansionary stance would involve ea sing both the rate and volume, and conversely, a contractionary stance w ould involve tightening both of them. Occasionally, there arise situations when the price and volume instruments are deployed in opposite directions - for exampl e, injecting liquidity amidst a rate tightening cycle - that call for both cau tious judgement and extra effort at communication.   20. In understanding the motive force for liquidity adjustme nt by a central bank, it must be noted that a growing econom y requires the central bank to inject primary liquidity to meet the requirement for currency and credit. This injection can come about only through an expansion of  the reserve (base) money. In the first instance, liquidity injection happens through overnight borrowing by banks under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF). If the liquidity shortage is of a durable nature, the central bank needs to meet that need through outright open market operations (OMOs) by buying government securities.   21. As we progressed with monetary  tightening through 2010, the LAF window shifted from a surplus (absorption) mode to a deficit (injection) mode. This was consistent with our anti-inflationary stan ce since a deficit liquidity situation would improve monetary transmission. We had also indicated clearly that  it would be the endeavour of the Reserve Bank to maintain  the absorption or injection through the LAF window at about ± 1 per cent of the net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of banks. However, towards the second half  of 2010, systemic liquidity tightened further pushing the injec tion through the LAF window beyond 1 per cent of NDTL. This was owing to a combination of struct ural and one-off factors. Recognizing that the deficit in systemic liquidity was of a durable nature, the Reserve Bank conducted outright OMOs to inject liquidity of a durable nature.  22. This liquidity injection through OMOs happened at a time when we were tightening policy rates to combat inflat ion. These were seemingly contrarian actions, and many observers may have seen them as being conflicting and incoherent. We realized that there was a communication challenge here - to explain to the market that we remained committed to bringing inflation down, that our action in injecting liquidity was not inconsis tent with our anti-i nflation stance, that we continued to hold that liquidity shoul d be in a deficit mode in a monetary tightening cycle, but that we were injec ting liquidity only to ease the ‘excessive deficit’ in order to ensure that flow of credit for productiv e purposes was not choked.   23. Informed market participants did of course understand the rationale for our actions. But we recognized the importance of communicating the rationale to the larger public. If people got confused policy signals a nd believed thereby that the central bank’s commitment to inflation control was not credible, inflation expectations would get unhinged and that would erode the effec tiveness of our anti-inflation strategy. We, therefore, went the extra mile to communicate the rationale at a non-technical level.  Forward Guidance: How transparent can/should a central bank be? 24. Received wisdom today is that successful monetary policy is not just a matter of effective calibration of overnight in terest rates, but also of shaping market expectations of the way in which interest rates, inflation and income are likely to evolve on the way forward. Among the important instruments used by central banks for this purpose is the ‘forward guida nce’ they give in their monetary policy statements.   25. The practice of giving forward guidance varies across central banks. By far the most explicit has been the Bank of Canada which, given th e uncertainty during the crisis, gave a definite timeframe until which it would keep ove rnight rate at the ‘current’ level, subject of course to  the outlook for inflation. The ECB has traditionally been less explicit on the ground that policy commitment is not possible in an uncertain macro environm ent. The US Fed has a more credible record of using forward guidance to shap e and manage expectations. For over two years since the crisis, the Fed had guide d the markets by saying that ‘economic conditions are likely to warra nt exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period’. In its most recent statement of August 9, 2011, the Fed quantified ‘extended period’ as ‘at l east upto mid-2013’, thereby giving a more definitive time frame for market participants  to plan. The Fed evidently expects that by reducing uncertainty, at least in one dimension (time dimension), the forward guidance will help stimulate demand.   26. Giving forward guidance is not alwa ys necessarily a positive sum game. Central banks face several dilemmas. The fi rst is how exactly is the conditionality surrounding the guidance to be worded. It cannot be so vague as to lose all content value; on the other hand, it cannot be so precise that the central bank becomes a prisoner of its words and loses any flexib ility to deviate from  the guidance should the underlying circumstances change. A s econd, and related, dilemma is how to ensure that the market correctly appr eciates the conditiona lity and does not interpret the guidance as an  irrevocable commitment.   27. Starting early 2010, in keeping with th e best practice, the Reserve Bank too has begun giving forward guidance. And as expected, we too ha ve confronted the classic communication dilemma. Let me illust rate. In the First Quarter Review of July 2011, we said: “Going forward, the monetary policy stance will depend on the evolving inflation trajectory, which in turn, will be determined by trends in domestic growth and global commodity prices. A change in stance will be motivat ed by signs of a sustainable downturn in inflation.”   28. Simultaneously, we also noted that the stance of monetary policy will be to “manage the risk of growth fall ing significantly below trend”.   29. Reading the two statements together, some analysts have criticized the guidance for its lack of precision; more specifically, there were questions like, ‘what is the trend growth ra te’ and ‘how much deviati on from trend would the RBI tolerate’. This was valid criticism and these questions were relevant. With our trend growth rate, post-crisis, estimated at 8 pe r cent, the balance of  policy stance would shift if growth fell consistently and substantially below that rate. But a shift in stance will also be a function of the behaviour of the external and internal drivers of inflation. What we said in response to the criticism therefore was that defining precisely ‘what significantly below trend’ ex-ante was difficult, and that the ambiguity in the guidance was deliberate because it was unavoidable.   30. Central to this whole issue of forwar d guidance is that a central bank is handicapped by external uncertainty over wh ich it has no control. The crisis has brought this dilemma into sharp focus. On the one hand, central banks want to use the instrumentality of forward guidan ce to manage expectations, and even outcomes; on the other hand, they cannot be  precise enough because of external uncertainty. How to communicate monetary po licy so that the be nefit-cost balance is positive is yet another d ilemma for central banks.  Should monetary policy respond to asset prices? 31. Among the many questions thrown up by th e crisis is one about the role of central banks in dealing with asset pr ice bubbles. The broadly accepted theology before the crisis - although not the only  view - was the Greenspan orthodoxy which can be summarized as follows. First, asset price bubbles are hard to identify in real time, and the fundamental fact ors that drive asset prices are not directly observable. A central bank should not therefore sec ond guess the market. Second, monetary policy is too blunt an instrument to count eract asset price booms. And third, central banks can ‘clean up the mess’ after the bubble bursts. The surmise therefore was that the cost-benefit calculus of a more activist monetary stance of “leaning against the wind” was clearly negative. In other wo rds, it is not the j ob of central bankers to remove the punch bowl no matter that the party is getting wild. 32. The crisis has dented the credib ility of the Greenspan orthodoxy. The emerging view post-crisis is that central banks cannot remain indifferent to asset price bubbles. However, it has thrown up a debate over what should be the role of the central bank and how that role might aff ect its other responsibilities, and indeed its autonomy. The debate is still fluid and there are no conclusive answers. Nevertheless, it has helped in crystallizing some views to guide the way forward. Let me discuss some of them.  33. As much as the pre-crisis orthodoxy about not deploying monetary policy in aid of asset price management has now lost  its potency, reservations persist about its efficacy. The essence of the argument is  that the typical monetary policy action of raising policy interest rate in sma ll steps of 25-50 basis points will not help contain the surge in asset prices. On  the other hand, monetary policy action aggressive enough to deter asset price build  up will take a heavy toll on the real economy. A consensus is building around the view that the most  appropriate way of addressing asset prices is through macroprudential instruments, either independently or in conjunction with monetary policy. Indeed, macroprudential instruments are at the heart of the Ba sel 3 package which was agreed upon last year.  34. Macroprudential policies are neat in concept but throw up a host of problems in operation. The t ools of macroprudential polic y such as capital norms, countercyclical buffers and risk weights fall within the domain of regulation. But there also has to be consistency between  the monetary stan ce and macroprudential policy. Does this then mean th at the central bank should al so have responsibility for bank regulation? If on the other hand, the responsibilities are distributed across different agencies, what should be the platform and protocol for coordination? What should be the role  of the government?   35. Indeed, the post-crisis trend has been  to entrust macroprudential supervision to central banks, and where cen tral banks already have this  responsibility, to define it more explicitly. While there could be some synergies in that, there are also questions about potential c onflicts of interest such as when, for example, the macroeconomic situation may require a tight  monetary policy, but the central bank may demur because such tightening may rais e concerns about the stability of the banking system. Some people argue t hough that potential conflicts between monetary policy and macroprudential polic y are being exaggerated. In entrusting responsibility for macroprude ntial supervision, and mo re broadly for financial stability, to central banks, there are con cerns also about how this responsibility, might impact the prized autonomy of central banks. This apprehension arises because macroprudential decisions entail a greater element of subjective judgement than do monetary policy decisions, and if that be the case, it opens up scope for interference from the outside.  36. My attempt as above has been only to give you a flavour of the many complex questions thrown up by this issu e of central bank responsibility for asset price management, indeed more broadly fo r financial stability. The scope of this lecture does not permit a detailed assessment of the debate. But let me give you the Reserve Bank perspective on this.  37. The Reserve Bank has traditionally had a much broader mandate, including responsibility for some development func tions, than is typical of advanced economy central banks. Our experience in regard to simultaneously managing both monetary policy and macroprudential policy has been positive, indeed synergistic. Asset price trends are one of the many vari ables we take into account in monetary policy calibration. We have used conventi onal monetary policy in struments such as policy interest rates if demand pressure s are across board. On the other hand, if demand pressures are confined to specific sectors, we have found it more efficient to use macroprudential instruments such as  risk weights and provisioning norms so as to put sand in the wheels of credit flowin g to those sectors. We have also used macroprudential instruments symmetrically - tightening in times of excess demand as, for example, in the years before the crisis, and easing in times of slackening demand, for example, as part of the crisis response.   38. Even as macroprudential policies have become the talk of the town post-crisis, deploying them requires careful j udgement. In order to make a judgement, a central bank has to ascertain if the asset price build up is driven by ‘excessive leverage’ and if the price build up is acro ss board or confined to specific sectors. By far the most important thing to remember in deploying macroprudential policies is that, with the benefit of hindsight, all conservative policies look safe. But excessive conservatism in order to be prep ared to ride out a potential crisis could thwart financial innovation a nd progress. It is this balance between preventing instability and promoting i nnovation that central banks have to learn to manage. And this is especially important in an  emerging market economy like India where the responsibility of the central bank for market development, though not explicit, is nonetheless quite  important.   How should monetary policy manage the interface with fiscal policy?  39. The seventy odd years since the Great  Depression saw a famous rivalry between fiscal and monetary policies for in fluence. For much of this period, almost across the developed world, Keynesian theo logy ruled, fiscal policy dominated and monetary policy remained subservient to  that. The stagflation of the 1970s, the influential monetarist views of Friedman et al and the apparent success of supply side policies to tame inflation prompted a shift in thinking aw ay from full bodied Keynesianism. Also important were the theo retical analysis of discretion vs. rules in setting monetary policy. Together, th e theoretical advances and empirical evidence allowed monetary policy to wean itself away from fiscal dominance and central banks started asserting their autonomy.   40. Even as the advantages of having an apolitical m onetary authority as an effective counterpoise to politically driven  fiscal policies were becoming evident, democratic compulsions made fiscal disc ipline increasingly difficult. To get around this, starting 1990s, several countries voluntarily enacted fiscal responsibility laws. The laws imposed limits on fiscal deficits/public debt on the one hand and prohibited primary financing of the fiscal  deficit by the central bank on the other. This institutional framework allowed operational independence to the central bank in its conduct of monetary policy within a rule-based regime and was successful in keeping inflation low.   41. The rule based fiscal regimes unravelled during the crisis as both governments and central banks implement ed expansionary policies in close coordination. While such coordination duri ng the crisis was not questioned except by extreme purists, now in the recovery pe riod, several fundamental concerns are resurfacing. At the heart of these concerns is whether monetary policy is once again becoming hostage to fiscal compulsions? The specifics of the debate vary but the basic issues are similar. In the US, the debate is over the trade-off between short-term fiscal stimulus and long-term fis cal consolidation. In the euro area, the question is about the shared benefits of  a monetary union without the shared responsibilities of a fiscal union. The questions  all around are: Are central banks being forced beyond their comfort zone to maintain expansionary monetary stances to compensate for fiscal laxity? Aren’t th e so called unconventional monetary actions thinly veiled fiscal measures?  Aren’t central banks, in the process, compromising their basic commitment to price stability? Are central banks becoming vulnerable to political pressures?  Is their autonomy at risk? The answers to these questions will be shaped by how the current big issues are settled.   42. As in many economies, in India too, monetary policy was dominated by fiscal considerations during the 1970s and the 1980s. Large and growing fiscal deficits ended up being financed by the Reserve Bank. This led to more than desired growth in base m oney and money supply which ul timately reflected in high inflation. Like other economies, we t oo put in place a fiscal responsibility legislation - the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003 - with ceilings on deficit and debt ra tios and provisions prohibiting primary financing of government debt by the cen tral bank. These provi sions facilitated fiscal consolidation during 2003-08 and afforded the Reserve Bank the necessary flexibility to implement monetary policy aimed at low and stable inflation.    43. Like elsewhere in the world, both mone tary and fiscal policies were eased in India too in response to the crisis. In pa rticular, this meant interrupting the fiscal consolidation process enjoined by the FRBM Act. As India emerged from the crisis, the Government adopted a revised road map for fiscal  consolidation as recommended by the Thirteenth Finance Commission. Nevertheless, meeting the road map targets is going to be a fo rmidable challenge. The quantum of non-discretionary expenditure (sal aries, pensions, interest payments) is large and this cannot be adjusted easily, at any rate in the short-term. By far the largest component of discretionary expenditure is on subsidies - on food, fertilizer and petroleum products. In reducing these subs idies, there is inevitably a tension between democratic compulsions and econom ic virtue. Even as the Government pursues a quantitative target, it also has to be mindful of the quality of fiscal adjustment - that is to prune unproduc tive expenditure and increase productive expenditure which is necessary for rais ing the potential outpu t of the economy.  44. As I said, the Reserve Bank has been battling inflation for the last twenty months. Monetary tightening, as is well known, works by restraining demand. In as much as the fiscal stance is supportive of demand, the monetary stance has had to be more aggressive than otherwise. For monetary policy to be more supportive of growth, it will be necessary for fiscal consolidation to take root more firmly.   45. The dilemma for monetary policy in I ndia is thus somewhat different from that of the advanced economies. The d ilemma for advanced economy central banks is whether monetary policy is having to be kept more accommodative than necessary to offset fiscal contraction. In  contrast, the dilemma for the Reserve Bank is whether monetary policy is having to be  tightened that much more because of fiscal demand.  Conclusion 46. In my remarks today, I have tried to  present to you some of the dilemmas we confront in monetary policy management . All central banks c onfront these, with differences in the extent and timing. I have tried to give you the Reserve Bank perspective on these. The message I tried to convey is that there are no template answers to real life policy issues. Analysis is important, but judgement is crucial. I believe a two way communication between central practitioners  and central bank scholars will help in sharpening bot h our analysis and judgement.  ', '1  On t he Importance of Independent Regulatory Institutions – The Case of the Central Bank  By Dr. Viral V Acharya, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India1 Delivered as the A . D. Shroff Memorial Lecture in Mumbai on Friday, October 26, 2018  No analogy is perfect; y et, analogies  help convey things  better . At times, a straw  man has to be set up to make succinctly a practical or even an academic point.  Occasionally,  however, real life examples come along beautifully to make a communicator’s work easier.  L et me start today with an antecedent  from 2010 as it is particularly apposite  for the theme of my talk : “My time at the central bank is up and that is why I have decided to leave my post definitively, with the satisfaction of my duty fulfilled,” Mr Martin Redrado, Argentina’s central bank chief, told a news conference late on Friday, January 29, 2010. “We have arrived at this situation because of the national government’s permanent trampling of institutions,” he said .  “Basically, I am defending two main concepts: the independence of the central bank in our decision- making process and that the reserves should be used for monetary and financial stability.”  The roots of this  dramatic  exit lay in an emergency decree passed by the Argentine government led by C ristina Fernandé z on December 14, 2009 , that would set up a Bicentennial Stability and Reduced Indebtedness Fund to finance publ ic debt maturing that year. This  involved the transfer of $6.6 billion of the central bank reserves to the national treasury. The claim was that the central bank had $18 billion in “excess reserves.” [In fact, Mr. Redrado had refused to transfer the funds ; so the government attempted to fire him , by another emergency decree on January 7, 2010 for misconduct and derel iction of duty;  this attempt, however, failed, as  it was unconstitutional.]  Besides sparking off one of the worst constitution al crises in Argentina since its  economic meltdown in 2001, the chain of events  led to a grave reassessment of its  sovereign risk.   Within a month of Mr. Redrado’s resignation, Argentine sovereign bond yields and the annual premium cost for buying insurance against loss from default on Argentine government bonds (measured as the sovereign credit default swap spread) shot up by about 2.5% or 250 basis points, by more than a fourth of their prior levels.                                                              1 I am grateful to Governor Dr. Urjit R Patel , Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for his suggestion to explore  this theme  for a speech , for referring me to the work of  the L ate Deena Khatkhate (2005),  and for his constant encouragement, feedback and guidance. I am also indebted to  insightful exchanges with  Professor Rak esh Mohan  of Yale University  and former Deputy Governor of the RBI ; Dr. Nachiket Mor of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, during his term as a Central Board M ember of the RBI ; my fellow  Deputy Governor, N. S. Vishwanathan; my colleague, Dr . Michael D . Patra, Executive Director and Monetary Po licy Committee member;  as well as Jose Ka ttoor, Mridul Saggar  and Vineet Srivastava of the RBI . All errors that remain are my own.  2  Alberto Ramos, Argentina analyst at Goldman Sachs, noted on February 7, 2010: “ Using central bank reserves to pay government obligations is not a positive development and the concept of excess reserves is certainly open to debate. It weakens the balance sheet of the central bank and provides the wrong incentive to the government, as it weakens the incentive to control the rapid expansion of spending and to promote some consolidation of fis cal accounts in 2010.”  Even more damagingly, a risk that Governor Redrado had warned about came to the fore. By beginning of January, 2010, Thomas Griesa, a New York judge, had frozen the Argentine central bank’s account held at the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York, following claims of investors that the central bank was no longer an autonomous agency but under the thumb of the country’s executive branch.  (The above summary is based in part on Argentina’s central bank chief resigns , Jude Webber, Financial Times, January 30, 2010; and Argen tina: Bank independence at stake as Redrado exits , Jason Mitchell, Euromoney, February 7, 2010)   This complex interplay of the sovereign’s exercise of its power s, the central banker’s exit, and the market’s revolt, will be at the center of my remarks today on why it is important for a well -functioning economy to have an independent central bank, i.e., a central bank that is independent from the executive branch of the governm ent.  I will also try to lay out  why the risks of undermining the central bank’s  independence are potentially cat astrophic, a “self -goal” of sorts, as it can trigger a crisis of confidence in capital markets that are tapped by government s (and others in the economy) to run thei r finances.   Why Nations Succeed (or Fail ) Before I d elve into this complex interplay, I wish to place the independence of the central bank in a more general context .  Academic discourse by political economi sts recognises the key role played by the rule of  law and accountability of government s in enabling countries to flourish.  Francis Fukuyama ( The Origins of Political Order , 2011) considers these two elem ents, along with adequate state - and institution -building, as all being critical for “getting to Denm ark,” or in other words, creating stable, peaceful, prosperous, inclusive and honest societies.  Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson ( Why Nations Fail, 2012) summarize their body of work on the primacy of the quality of institutions in explaining the politic al and economic success or failure of states.  Taking examples of “twin” country case studies (such as S. Korea and N. Korea), the book elaborates  the following important distinction:  - Inclusive economic and political institutions  involve plura lity in decision -making which help guarantee the rule of law and foster talent and creativity ; in the presence of such institutions , economics and politics do not  become hostage to a set of incumbents likely to be hurt by change.  3  - In contrast , extractive institutions limit access to a country’s economic and financial resources to the ruling elites, hinder change and innovation, and over time, lead to stagnation and atrophy of the country ’s potential.  In conversations with former colleagues at New York University’s Stern School of Busi ness (NYU Stern) , it was routine to categorise  economies as encouraging and supporting either value creation, whereby entrepreneurs believed their mantra of success lay in challenging orthodoxy, or rent extraction, wherein businesses fo und value primarily from joining hands with regressive state policies and crowding out others who had no such access. Regardless of the preferred theory and terminology for the importance of institutions, it is well accepted that they include , inter alia , property rights and their enforcement, the judicia ry, and the election office in a democracy , instituted not just de jure but allowed to operate independently and function effectively de facto.  Somewhat less celebrated is the institution of an independent central bank, perhaps not just because the central bank is a relatively new kid on the block  (in most cases less than a century old), but also because it interacts less directly with the public  though its true influence is far -reaching.  Government and the Central Bank – A Tale of Two Horizons   A central bank performs several important functions for the economy: it controls the money supply; sets the rate of interest on borrowing and lending money; manages the external sector including the exchange rate; supervises and regulates the financial sector, notably banks; it often regulates cred it and foreign exchange markets ; and, seeks to ensure  financial stability , domestic as well as on the external f ront. The world over, the central bank is set up as an  institution separate from the government; put another way, it is not a department of the executive function of the government ; its powers are enshrined as being separate through relevant legislation . Its tasks being somewhat complex and techni cal, central banks are ideally headed and manned by technocrats or field experts  – typically economists, academics, commercial bankers, and occasionally private sector representatives, appointed by the government but not elected to the office. This architecture reflects the acceptance of the thesis that central banks should be allowed to exercise their powers independently. Why is the central bank separate  from the government ? I will offer what I find to be a particularly intu itive explanation:  (1) The first part of the explanation relates to the horizon of decision- making of a government vis-à-vis that of the central bank.   A government’s horizon of decision- making is rendered short , like the duration of a T20 match (to use a cricketing analogy ), by several considerations. There are always upcoming elections of some sort – national, state, mid- term, etc.  As elections approach, delivering on proclaimed manifestos of the past acquires urgency; where manifestos cannot be delivered  4  upon, populist alternatives need to be arranged with immediacy. Less important in the present scenario, but only recently  so, wars had to be waged, financed and won at all costs. This myopia or short -termism of governments is best summarized in h istory by Louis XV when he proclaimed “Apres moi, le deluge!”  (After me, the flood!).2  In contrast, a central bank plays  a Test match, trying to win each session but importantly also  survive it so as to have a chance to win the next session, and so on. In particular,  the central bank is not directly subject to political  time pressures and the induced neglect of the future; by virtue of being nominated rather than elected , central bankers have horizons of decision-making that tend to be longer than that of go vernments, spanning election cycles or war periods . While they clearly have to factor in the immediate consequences of their policy decisions, central bankers can afford to take a pause, reflect, and ask the question as to what would be the long- term con sequences of their , as well as government’s,  policies. Indeed, by their mandate central banks are committed  to stabilise the economy over business and financial cycles, and hence, have to peer into the medium to long term.  Unsurprisingly, central ban ks st rive to build credibility through a series of difficult choices that reflect sacrificing short -term gains for long- term outcomes such as price or financial stability .  (2) The second part of the explanation as to why the central bank is separate from the government relates to the observation that much of what the central bank manages  or influences  – money creation, credit creation, external sector management , and financial stability  – involves potential front -loaded benefits to the economy but with the possibility of attendant “tail risk ” in the form of back- loaded costs from financial  excess or instability . For example,   (i) Greater supply of money can facilitate ease of financial transactions, including  the financing of government deficits, but this can cause economy to over -heat in due course and trigger (hyper -) inflationary pressures  or even a full -blown crisis  that eventually require sharper monetary contractions ;   (ii) Excessive lowering of interest rates and/or relaxation in  bank capital and liquidity requirements can lead to greater credit creation , asset -price inflation,  and semblance of strong economic growth in the short  term, but excessive credit growth is usually accompanied by lendin g down the quality c urve which trigger s mal-investment , asset -price crashes,  and fina ncial crises in the long  term;   (iii) Allowing foreign capital flows to flood into the economy can temporarily ease the financing pressures for  an expanding government balance -sheet and the crowd ed-out                                                             2 See Acharya and Rajan (2013)  for a complete theoretical analysis modeling government myopia  and populism (maximising simply the cash- flow and spending each per iod) in the presence of a sovereign debt market;  implications for policies  governing the financial sector;  and attendant risks in the form of economic repression and financial crises.  5  private sector, but a  “sudden stop” or exodus of these flows in future can trigger a collapse of the exchange rate with adverse economy- wide spillovers; and,   (iv) Sweeping bank loan losses under the rug by compromising supervis ory and regulatory standards can create a façade of financial stability in the short ru n, but inevitably cause the fragile deck of cards to fall in a heap  at some point in future, likely with a greater taxpayer bill and loss of potential output .   While not a lways the case, often the requi red interventions for stable growth are structural reforms  by the government  with upfront fiscal outlay ; however, these may compromise populist expenditures or require displeasing incumbents.  As a result, it might seem as an  expedient solution to the government to  ask/task/mandate/direct  the central bank  to pursue strategies that generate short -term gains but effectively create tail risk s for the economy.  To protect the economy from such short -termism , the central bank is designed to be at a safe distance from the executive branch of the government.  Undermining the Independence of the Central Bank  Now, although the central bank is formally organised  to be separate from the government, its effective horizon of decision- making can be reduced for short -term gains by the government , if it so desires,  through a variety of mechanisms, inter alia ,  (i) Appointing government (or government -affiliated) officials rather than technocrats to key central bank positions, such as Governor , and more generally, seni or management ;   (ii) Pursuing steady attrition and erosion of statutory powers of the central bank through piece -meal legislative amendments that directly or indirectly eat at separation of the central bank from the government ;   (iii) Blocking or opposing rule -based central banking policies, and favoring instead discretionary or joint decision -making with direct government interventions; and,   (iv) Setting up parallel regulatory agencies with weaker statutory powers and/ or encouraging development of unregulated (or lightly regulated) entities that perform financial intermediation functions outside the purview of the c entral bank.3,4                                                               3 The most striking example is the presence of government- sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to support mortgages and home ownership in the United States. The GSEs are outside of any regulatory purview of the Federal Reserve, but have been deployed by successive g overnments to pursue populist housing policies, contributing significantly to the imbalances that led to the Global Financial Crisis of 2007 -08 and the ensuing Great Recession (see, Acharya, van Nieuwerburgh, Richardson and White, 2011, for details ).  4 See Acharya (2015)  for discussion on the resulting need to ensure that the central bank has regulatory scope over parts of “shadow banking” that are likely to be systemically important.  6  If such efforts are successful, they induce policy myopia in the economy that substitutes macroeconomic stability with punctuated arrival of financial crises.  There fore, there  are several reasons why enshrining and maintaining central bank independence ends up being an inclusive reform for the economy; and conversely, undermining such independence a regressive, extractive one:  (i) When t he government is seen often making efforts to dilute the central bank’s polici es and effectively coercing the central bank into such dilutions , banks and private sector spend more time lobbying for policies that suit them individually, at the cost of collective good, rather than investing in value creation and growth.   (ii) When governance of the central bank is undermined, it is unlikely to attract or be able to retain the brightest minds that thrive on the ability to debate freely, think independently, and e ffect change; attrition of central bank powers results in attrition of its human capital and deterioration of its efficiency and expertise over time.   (iii) When important parts of financial intermediation are kept outside the purview of the central bank, systemic risks can build up in “shadow banking” with private gains in good times to a small set of players but at  substantive costs to future generations in the form of unchecked financial fragility .  As such, the divergence in horizon of decision -making between government and the central bank that I have highlighted need not lead to any operational incompatibility a s long as it is well -understood and well -accepted by both parties that it is precisely given this divergence that the central bank is formally separated from the executive office and meant to conduct its functions in an independent manner. The central bank can of course make mistakes,  and is generally held publicly accountable through parliamentary scrutiny and transparency norms. This way, the institutional arrangement of independence, transparency and accountability to the public not only balance but also  strengt hen the central bank’s autonomy.  However, direct intervention and interference by the government in operational mandate of the central bank negate it s functional autonomy.   “Kiss of Death” – Incurring the Wrath of Markets  Far-sighted government leaders may be able to reap benefits o f convincing voters about the importance of investing  in macro -economic stability; for instance, by claim ing credit for the long- term nature of financia l sector outcomes attained by allowing the central bank autonomy in decision- making and delivery of its core  functions. When such a measured  perspective of an independent central bank as a key element of durable economic prosperity is missing  and/or government myopia so rife as to lead to regular inroads into central ba nking apparatus and decisions , unfortunate accidents can arise. Macroeconomic management can become  a tug of war  between securing stability and inflicting misdirection; daily operational decisions lead to power struggles; and, as the central bank is forced to bend over backwards to retain credibility in the 7  face of imminent pressures that would erode it s independence , counter efforts to reduce its independence  escalate.   As this dynamic  plays out, markets wat ch keenly , and if uncertainty grows and con fidence in central bank independence and credibility erode, then markets rap bond yields and exchange rate  on the knuckles !   Let me elaborate.  Modern economies are, by and large , not autarkies; they rely on capital markets to finance their investments. This is especially true of governments as reflected in the relatively large size of sovereign (and quasi -sovereign) debt markets, denominated in domestic currency as well as foreign currency. As long- term risks such as inflation or financial in stability rise, markets reprice  sovereign debt  and may potentially shun its financing altogether . This could have immediate spillovers to other markets such as for foreign exchange and foreign investments, potenti ally putting at risk also the external sector stability of the economy.  Therefore, the  presence of this third player – the market – in the back and forth between a government and the central bank (more generally, regulatory institutions) is an important feedback mechanism.  The market  can discipline the government not to erode central bank independence, and it can  also make the government pay for its transgressions . Interestingly, the market also forces central banks to remain a ccountable and independent wh en it is under government pressure .5 Besides the market revolt and strictures during the Argentine episode of 2010 that I recounted in my introductory remarks, it is to be noted that both of this year’s emerging market sovereign bond and currency meltdowns got  catalysed through a perception of government influence on central bank’s monetary policy, including through sporadic communication by government with public  on its desire to control the  central bank’s decision -making. I n one case, a rate cut in the wake of rising inflation and mounting fiscal deficit  did the damage ; and in the other, it was a public pronouncement by the  premier of the state about the “evils ” of interest rate hikes even when inflation was  in double digit terrain.  Indeed, the market censure need not be limited to emerging markets.  The public expression of government ’s bewilderment and disappointment at monetary tightening in the world’s largest safe- haven e conomy, again  at a time of rising inflation and fiscal deficit,  has raised in minds of investors  scenarios under which its  reserve currency status can not anymore be taken for granted (A debate about central -bank independence is overdue, The Economist, Oct 20, 2018) .   Barry Eichengreen, P rofessor of Economics and Political Science at  the University of California, Berkeley, covers superbly, in his recent piece (2018), this critical feedback role of the market :                                                             5 An interesting suggestion from Michael Patra is that perhaps economies should not only have rules that delineate clearly the roles of the government and the central bank, but also a dispute resolution mechanism a la the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The very presence of a referee would recognise that differences in objectives and horizons of decision- making arise; central bank and government can (to borrow his exact words) “go in there, slug it out, come out battered, but in understanding, since there has to be a clear winner whose hand will be upheld by the jury.” 8  “There are good reasons why countries … delegate monetary policy decisions to technocrats appointed for their expertise.  They can take the long view.  They can resist the temptation to manipulate monetary conditions f or short -term gain.  Privileging long -term stability, as history has shown, is positive for economic performance.  And it is on this performance that elected leaders, rightly or wrongly, are judged. Thoughtful politicians understand this. Hence their support for central bank independence and their respect for the convention that they should refrain from seeking to influence central bank decisions.  Unfortunately, not all politicians are thoughtful.  Not all have the patience to wait for long- term gains.  Not all are pleased when appointees refuse to bow to their wishes.  And not all are respectful of inherited institutions and conventions, be they central bank independence or, more broadly, the division of powers.  The question is whether they pay attention t o markets.”  What Barry Eichengreen is perceptively observ ing is that if a government  were to pay attention to markets, it  would realize that  central bank independe nce is in fact  its strength and the central bank a sort of a true friend, someone who will tell the government unpleasant but brutally honest truths  and correct to the extent it can any  adverse long -term consequences of government  policies .  Let me now turn to how all this relates to the Reserve Bank of India.   The Late Deena Khatkhate provides a masterful and scholarly assessment in Reserve Bank of India: A Study in the Separation and Attrition of Powers (2005). Some of the discussion below draws heavily from his assessment and is updated for developments  since then.  Other excellent discussions  of the central bank’s autonomy and independence  in the Indian context  are contained in lectures by the Reserve Bank of India’s former Governors, Dr. C. Rangarajan (1993) a nd Dr. Y. V. Reddy (2001, 2007).  As we will see below, other Governors and Deputy G overnors have also carried this abidi ng theme through their tenures.  For some of them, even when the Reserve Bank’s independence has been unclear de jure , governments have in the end have had the wisdom to support  it de facto; for others, however, the Reserve Bank’s independence has remained  a work in progress, a n enduring challenge that the nation has been grappling with on an ongoing basis .  Progressive E volution in Restoring Independence of the Reserve Bank of India  While the Reserve Bank has always der ived several important powers from the Reserve Bank Act, 1935 and the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, what matters is the effective independence with which these powers can be exercised in practice.  Over time, great strides have been undertaken by successiv e governments at the behest of the central bank, several economists, and umpteen committee reports, to restore the operational independence of the Reserve Bank. I will touch upon three such areas of healthy progress . 9  (1) Monetary Policy:  The Reserve Bank , like many central banks of the time , got quickly trapped into the socialist planning policies of  post-independence government, setting not just the rate o f interest on money but practically all rates of credit at different maturities , as well as doing sectoral credit allocatio n to the real economy.    Post the deregulation of interest rates in the 1990 s, monetary policy achieved a more modern dimension.  To start with, there was  a “multiple indicators” approach to setting interest rates . Having too many objectives for monetary policy  violate s the Tinbergen principle of “on e objective, one instrument” ; it also render s it difficult to understand or communicate what the interest -rate setting  is attempting to achieve at any point of time . Importantly, this  approach entertain ed much  regulatory  discretion , often  at the level of an individual, viz. the Reserve Bank Governor.  This made independence of monetary policy individual -specific; in other words, it allowed  for government pressure  to creep in easily for keep ing rates low at times of fiscal expansion  under one guise or the other .   This is exactly a setting where rules woul d be better than discretion, in particular to avoid the time -inconsistency problem, highlighted in the work of Nobel laureates Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott in 1970s and early 1980s.  Kydland and Prescott (1977) consider  the implication that people, including investors, could look into the future and anticipate the behavior of self -interested governments, so that a discretionary monetary policy could end up being compromised by government pressures, leaving inflationary expectations unanchored, whereas a monetary policy committed to a rule would be harder to bend and keep inflationary expectations at bay.6  Following several episodic bouts of double -digit inflation, a war on inflation  and inflationary expectations,  was finally launched in September 2013 by the then Governor Raghuram G Rajan; the  Urjit Patel Committee Report to Revise and Strengthen the  Monetary Policy Framework was released in 2014 ; and, finally, the Reserve Bank of India Act was modified in August 2016 to constitute the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) .   The MPC  consists of three RBI members, including the Governor who reserves a casting vote, and three external memb ers appointed by the government. The MPC  has been legislatively awarded a flexible inflation -targeting mandate  of achieving 4% consumer price index (CPI) inflation in the medium term, while paying attention to growth, with operational independence to achieve it , and with accountability in terms of transparency around the MPC’s  resolution, minutes summarising  each individual committee member’s decision, bi -annual monetary policy reports, and a written report to the government  in case a +/ - 2% band around the target inflation level is violated for three quarters in a row .                                                               6 See also Buiter and Sibert (2000), who lay out the theoretical basis for the required legal and institutional arrangements, primarily operational  independence of the central bank, for an effective monetary policy.  10  The MPC, two years old since, has attempted steadfastly through its rate -setting decisi ons to build credibility  of the inflation target, a process  that is generally believed , and empirically documented, to help lower  the long-term bond yields as well as  stabilise the exchange rate .   While the jury will remain out fo r some time on the economic impact of the flexible  inflation -targeting framework, it is incontrovertible that the MPC has given  monetary policy an independent institutional foundation. The government deserves much credit for its far -sightedness in legislating the required ch ange s to strengthen this aspect of central bank’s independence and distancing itself in th e process from monetary decision- making (other than through the appointment of external members on the MPC) .  (2) Debt Management : For several decades post -independence, the Reserve Bank participated  in short -term Treasury Bill issuances of the Government of India  (bearing extraordinarily low interest rates) to fund its fiscal deficits .  The Reserve Bank also public ly acknowledged that its open market operations (OMOs) were primarily geared to manage the government bond yields .  This  implied that the central bank  balance- sheet  was always available as a resource – just like tax receipts  – ready to monetise excessive government spending.  Unsurprisingly, high inflation in India was engineered to please both Milton Friedman and Thomas Sargent, i.e., it was a lways both a monetary and a fiscal phenomenon, as these two Nobel laureates in economics had respectively argued  (Friedman, 1970 a nd Sargent, 1982).  Eventually, recognizing the fiscal imprudence and inflationary risks engendered by such automatic monetization of government deficits, joint efforts between the Reserve Bank and the government during 1994- 1997 limited deficit financing from the Reserve B ank to the cappe d Ways and Means Advances (WMA) . The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act of 2003 explicitly prohibited  the Reserve Bank from participating in primary issuance s of the government  securit ies. Open market operations came to be designed to sterilise the impact on domestic money supply of foreign exchange interventions and/or to meet durable liquidity needs of the economy, rather than to fund deficits . While there have been relapses to old ha bits, overall these  changes have left the task of government debt management with the Reserve Bank as primarily being one of auctioning government debt and helping it switch between securities or conduct buybacks, rather than of intricate involvement in fiscal planning, and more importantly, in its funding.  Furthermore , the repressive levels of Statutory Liquid Ratio (SLR) and Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), which ensured substantial portions of bank deposits were channeled to the government or were readily avai lable to debase in value through monetary expansion, have now been rationalised to be more or less in line with inte rnational prudential standards.  For instance, in case of SLR, the level has been steadily reduced and the plan is to harmonise it with the Basel III Liqu idity Coverage Ratio (LCR) .   11  (3) Exchange Rate Management : In the Five Year Plans post -independence, prices including the exchange rate  were assumed to be constant; however, since the true value of the Rupee fluctuated with market price s and macroeconomic conditi ons, the Sterling holdings had no choice but to take an undue hit.  The underlying true value of the Rupee was also affected heavily –– but not reflected in reality –– by monetary policy and debt management operations that were  implicitly supporting the  ballooning of government deficits.  The result of the fixed exchange rate regime in the midst of  “fiscal dominance” was that the Reserve Bank was essentially a  silent  spectator in the build -up to the inevitable exchange rate disequilibrium  (though arguably this was true of much of the world at that time).  Since 1976, when the level of the Rupee moved to being a “managed float” against a basket of currencies, and especially since 1993, the exchange rate has gradually evolved from being entirely a fixed rate t o being market -determined for all practical purposes . The Reserve Bank deploys  reserves management and  macro -prudential controls on foreign capital  flows to manage excessive ly large movements . With a flexible inflation -targeting mandate for interest- rate policy and funding of fiscal deficit no longer  the objective of monetary operations, the desired exchange rate management rests with the Reserve B ank.  Ongoing Challenges in Maintaining Independence of the Reserve Bank of India  Few important pockets of persistent weakness, however, remain  in maintaining independence of the Reserve Bank .  Some of these areas were also  identified in the 2017 Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) of India by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) as ways to strengthen the independence of the Reserve Bank, an area in which the FSAP rates India as “materially non- compliant” .   (1) Regulation of Public Sector Banks: One important limitation is that the Reserve Bank is statutorily limited in undertaking the full scope of actions against public sector banks (PSBs) – such as asset divestiture, replacement of management and Board, licens e revocation, and resolution actions such as mergers or sales –– all of which it can and does deploy effectively in case of private banks. The significant implications of this limitation were highlighted in detail in Governor Patel’s speech in March 2018, Banking Regulatory Powers should be Ownership Neutral . To reite rate from the FSAP (Para 39 in Summing up Responsibilities, Objectives, Powers, Independence, and Accountabilities, the B asel Core Principles Deta iled Assessment Report ):   “Legislation should be ame nded to enable the RBI to extend all the powers currently exercised over private sector banks to PSBs; in particular, regarding Board member dismissals, mergers and license revocation. …  It should also remove the option of an appeal to the government when the RBI revokes a license.  If statutory changes are difficult, the RBI and the government should consider adopting a framework agreement 12  whereby the government would acknowledge the RBI’s full operational authority and independence in supervision and regulation, as they did recently for  monetary policy.”   (2) The Reserve Bank’s Balance- sheet Strength:  Having adequate reserves to bear any losses that arise from central bank operations and having appropriate rules to allocate profits (including rules that govern the accumulation of capital and reserves) is considered an important part of central bank’s independence from the government (see, for example, Moser -Boehm, 2006). A thorny ongoing issue on this front has been that of the rules for surplus transfer from the Reserve Bank to the governmen t (Cogencis, 2018, “Govt pegs RBI excess capital at 3.6 trln rupees, seeks it as surplus” ), an issue  that relates closely to the leading Argentine exampl e in my introductory remarks.  It has been covered deftly by Rakesh Mohan (2018) in the last  of his three -part series of recent articles  on the Reserve Bank , titled Protect the RBI’s balance- sheet; therein, he  elucidates  why a cen tral bank needs a strong balance -sheet to perform its full range of critical functions for the economy.  I quote his main points below:   “First, …  The longer -term fiscal consequences would be the same if the government issued new securities today to fund the expenditure. [R]aiding the RBI’s capital creates no new government revenue on a net basis over time, and only provides an illusion of free money in the short term.”   “Second, … The use of such a transfer would erode whatever confidence that exists in the government’s intention to practice fiscal prudence.”   “Third, … In theory, a central bank can implement monetary policy appropriately with a wide range of capital levels, including levels below zero. In practice, the danger is that it may lose credibility with the financial markets and public at large, and may then be unable to attain its objective if it has substantial losses and is seen as  havin g insufficient capital.   Are fears with regard to possible central bank losses illusory? According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), 43 out of 108 central banks reported losses for at least one year between 1984 and 2005.  It is also argued by some that the government can always recapitalise a central bank when necessary. This is certainly true in principle but is practically difficult when the government itself suffers from fiscal pressures and maintains a relatively high debt -GDP ratio, as  is the case in India. What is also important is the erosion of central bank independence both in reality and perhaps, even more importantly, in optics. …   Once again, better sense has prevailed and the government has not raided the RBI’s balance sheet.”   13  (3) Regulatory Scope: A final issue is one of regulatory scope, the most recent case in point being the recommendation to bypass the central bank’ s powers over payment  and settlement systems by appointing a separate payments regulator (also covered by Rakesh Mohan in his series, ibid). The Reserve Bank has published its dissent note against this recommendation  on October 19, 2018.  Conclusion Let me conclu de with some notes of gratitu de and dedication as well as some for  further reflection.  Mr. Malegam  has been  a long- time adviser, friend and well -wisher of the Reserve Bank of India, as well  as its former Board Member.  He is someone I personally admire for his int ellect, clarit y of thinking and sagacity.  I thank you, Mr. Malegam,  for inviting me to deliver the  A D Shroff Memorial Lecture for this year.    The Late Ardashir Darabshaw Shroff  served as India’s non -official delegate in 1944 at the United Nations “Bretton Woods Conference” on post -war financial and monetary arrangements.  One of his primary concerns was to seek a permanent seat on the executive board of the International Monetar y Fund and the World Bank, which unfortunately did not materialise. To me, his most important contribution was the co -founding in 1954 of the Free Forum Enterprise think tank which through open dialogue presented a counterpoint to the socialist tendencies that were t aking root in the country in the post -independence era  government .  Sucheta Dalal’s biography, A. D. Shroff -  Titan of Finance and Free Enterprise (2000), notes that George Woods, one of the most popular presidents of the World Bank, said of him : “Nobody could accuse A. D. Shroff of hiding his opinions and in the later years of his life, very rarely were those opinions fashionable in India. Yet few patriots did more than he [did] to make friends for the Indian nation and to build confidence in that nation among those throughout the world whose business it is to provide capital for sound investment opportunities.”  In all humility , to emulate A. D. Shroff’s freedom to criticize policy “actuated by the single motive of trying to promote the good of my country”  (from his letter to Sir Osborne Smith, the first Governor of the Reserve Bank), I chose for today’s occasion the theme of the  importance of  independent  regulatory institutions, and in particular,  that of a central bank that is independent from an over-arching reach of the state. This theme is certainly one of great sensitivity but I contend it is of even gr eater importance to our economic prospects .  I earnestly hope that I have  done some justice to his immortal legacy  to independent economic di scourse and policy- making.  In the process, I have  attempted to convince  you that we have made good progress  in earnin g the Reserve Bank’s independence, most notably in the monetary policy framework  (changes wherein, along with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the Goods and Services Tax, were considered as crucial structural reforms by Moody’s in  upgrading India’s sovereign rating eleven  months back) . To secure greater financial and macroeconom ic stability, these efforts need to be extended to effective independence for the Reserve Bank in its regu latory and supervisory 14  powers over public sector banks , its balance- sheet strength , and its regulatory scope.  Such endeavor would be a true inclusive  reform for the Indian economy’s future . Thankfully, it is only  a matter of making the  right choices, which I believe as a society we can with adequate ly thoughtful  “what -if” analysis ; I have sketch ed a scenario, which several parts of the world are presently witnessing, of  great risk to nations  from  undermining the independence of their central banks . In his excellent biography, Volcker:  The Triumph of Persistence (2012) , my former NYU Stern colleague, Bill Silber, describes in vivid detail how in th e 1980s, the then Federal Reserve Governor Paul Volcker adopted a curmudgeonly approach to setting int erest rates to target inflation.  Besides resisting any and all pressure to keep rates low , which would have  effectively allow ed cheap funding – in the short term – of President Reagan’s expansionary deficit -based manifesto, Volcker engaged personally with the President to convey the perils of running high fiscal deficits right  after double -digit inflation had just been tamed. In the end, Volcker w on the day as wise counsel prevailed , deficits were reined in , and inflation tamed even further . I woul d argue that  through Volcker ’s tough stance on inflation and candour on risks from government’s fiscal plans, the institution of the Federal Reserve had in fact been  President Reagan’s true friend. As many parts of the world today await  greater g overnment respect fo r central bank independence, independent central banker s will remain undeterred . Governments that do not respect  central bank independence  will sooner or later incur  the wrath of financial markets, ignite economic fire, and come to rue the day they undermined an important regulatory institution; their wiser counterparts who invest in central bank independence will enjoy lower costs of borrowing, the love of international investors, and longer life spans .

', '1 Going Bust for Growth1There are few areas of robust growth around the world, with the IMF repeatedly reducing its growth forecasts in recent quarters. This period of slow growth is particularly dangerous because both industrial countries and emerging markets need high growth to quell ris ing domestic political tensions. Policies that attempt to divert growth from others rather than create new growth are more likely under these circumstances. Even as we create conditions for sustainable growth, we need new rules of the game, enforced impartially by multilateral organizations, to ensure countries adhere to international responsibilities.  The conventional diagnosis and remedy Why is the world finding it so hard to restore pre-Great Recession growth rates? The obvious answer is that the financial boom preceding the Great Recession left industrial countries with an overhang of debt, and debt, whether on governments, households, or banks, is holding back growth.2 While the remedy may be to write down debt so as to revive demand from theindebted, it is debatable whether additional debt fuelled demand is sustainable in the long run. At any rate, large-scale debt write-offs (or fiscal transfers to the heavily indebted) seem politically difficult even if they are economically warranted. How does one offset weak household and government demand if debt write-downs are off the table ? Ideally, the response would be to incentivize investment and job creation through low interest rates and tax incentives. But if final demand from consumers is likely to be very weak for a considerable period of time because of debt overhang, the real return on new investment may collapse. The Wicksellian neutral real rate – loosely speaking the interest rate required to bring the economy back to full employment with stable inflation -- may even be strongly negative.3 This typically has been taken as grounds for aggressive monetary policy.Because policy rates cannot be reduced significantly below zero (though a number of European countries are testing the se limits), equilibrium long term interest rates may stay higher than levels necessary to incentivize investment. Hence, central banks have embarked on unconventional monetary policy (UMP), which would directly lower long rates. Another way to stimulate demand is for governments that still have the ability to borrow to increase spending. Since this will increase already-high levels of government debt, proponents suggest investing in infrastructure, which may have high returns today when 1 Remarks by Dr. Raghuram Rajan, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India on May 19, 2015 to the Economic Club  of New York. Rajan thanks Dr. Prachi Mishra of the Reserve Bank for very useful comments and research support.  2 See the interesting e vidence in Atif Mian and Amir Sufi,  House of Debt  (Princeton University Press,  New Jersey , 2014)  and the cross -country evidence in  Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff , This Time is Different   (Princeton University Press, New Jersey, 2008). For an illuminati ng overall view of the global financial crisis and the policy remedies , see  Martin Wolf, The Shifts and  the Shocks: What We\'ve Learned and Have Still to Learn from the Financial Crisis  (Penguin USA 2015).  3 Though see a thoughtful piece by Claudio Borio and Piti Disyatat at http://www.voxeu.org/article/low-interest-rates-secular-stagnation-and-debt  suggesting that the real neutral interest rate may be influenced by low policy rates. Intuitively, the authors argue that low policy rates can sow the seeds for investment misallocation, financial distress, and debt overhang, all of which can combine to drive down the future real return on investment, and therefore the real neutral long term rate today.    2   construct ion costs and interest rates are low. However , high-return  infrastructure investment is harder  to identify and implement in developed countries where most obvious investments have already been made – political influence is as likely to create bridges to no where or unviable high speed train networks as needed infrastructure . Also, while everyone can see the need for repair and renovation of existing infrastructure, this requires far more decentralized spending than mega projects, and may be harder to initiat e and finance from the centre.  Put differently, high-return  infrastructure investment is a good idea but may be hard to implement on a large scale for most advanced country governments.  To the extent that such debt fuelled spending creates a self -fulfill ing virtuous cycle of confidence and activity, it can be a bridge to sustainable growth. But to the extent that it misallocates capital (because there are insufficient “shovel -ready” projects , so much of the emergency spending is diverted to rent-seeking p ork), it can worsen public anxieties about the future, reducing corporate investment and increasing household savings.  All t his highlights  another concern. Even if s timulus work s in raising growth temporarily -- and the above  discussion suggests it may not  – this growth  has to be a bridge to sustained aggregate demand. But what if it isn’t?  The Productivity Puzzle, Secular Stagnation, and other concerns.  The arguments I have just enunciated for action apply to an economy where nothing fundamentally is wron g except perhaps excessive debt  – what is needed is a cyclical return of growth to potential growth . Yet a number of economists such as Tyler Cowen, Robert Gordon, and Larry Summers have raised the possibility that potential growth in industrial countries had fallen even before the Great Recession. Perhaps the n the growth that we are trying to return to  is unachievable without serious distortions.  The term “secular stagnation” used by Larry Summers to describe the current persistent economic malaise, echoin g Alvin Hansen’s speech in 1938 in the midst of the Great Depression, has caught on.4 But different economists focus on different aspects and causes of the stagnation. 5 Summers emphasizes the inadequacy of aggregate demand, and the fact that the zero lowe r bound as well as the potential for financial instability prevents monetary policy from being more active. Among the reasons for weak aggregate demand include ageing populations that want to consume less and the increasing income share of the very rich, w hose marginal propensity to consume is small.  Tyler Cowe n and Robert Gordon on the other hand, emphasize a weak supply potential.6 They argue that the post -World War II years were an aberration because growth was helped in industrial countries by reconstr uction, the spread of technologies such as electricity,                                                             4 Summers, L.

Ho wever, post -war total factor productivity growth – the part of growth stemming from new ideas and methods of production – was lower than  its 1920 -50 high. More recently, not only has productivity growth fallen further  (with a temporary positive uptick towa rds the end of the 1990s because of the IT revolution) , but growth has been held back by the headwinds of plateauing education levels and labour participation rates, as well as a shrinking labour force in some countries because of population ageing.  It is obvious from these lists of factors that it is hard to disentangle the effects of weak aggregate demand from slow growth in potential supply. Population ageing contributes to both. Indeed, one may cause the other . For example, anticipating a sl owdown in growth potential, households, worried about impending retirement in the face of undeliverable pension and healthcare entitlements, may try and build savings. This will  depress demand further. Conversely, anticipated weak demand may reduce incentives for cor porations to invest  in physical and human capital , causing supply potential to grow more slowly.  Structural reforms, typically ones that increase competition, foster innovation, and drive institutional change, are the way to raise potential growth. But the se immediately hurt protected constituencies that have become accustomed to the rents they get from the status quo. Moreover, the gains to constituencies that are benefited are typically later and uncertain while the pain is immediate and its incidence cle ar. No wonder Jean -Claude Juncker, then Luxembourg’s prime minister, said at the height of the Euro crisis, “ We all know what to do , we just don\'t know how to get re -elected  after we\'ve done it!”  The Growth Imperative   If indeed fundamentals are such that that the industrial world has, and will, grow slowly for a while before new technologies and  new markets come to the rescue, would it be politically easy to settle for slower growth? After all,  per capita income is high in industrial countries, and a few y ears of slow growth would not be devastating at the aggregate level. Why is there so much of a political need for growth?  One reason is the need to fulfil government commitments. As sociologist Wolfgang Streeck writes , in the strong growth years of the 196 0s when visions of a “Great Society” seemed attainable , industrial economies  made enormous promises  of social security to the wider public.7 Promises have been augmented since then in some countries by politically convenient (because hidden from budgets) b ut fiscally unsound increases in pension and old age healthcare commitments to public sector workers . And most recently, the government debt taken on before and after the Great Recession has added to government commitments, even while the Baby Boomer gener ation has started retiring in large numbers. Without the immediate promise of growt h, all these commitments c ould soon be seen as unsustainable.                                                              7 See “The Crises of Democratic Capitalism”, Wolfgang Streeck, New Left Review  71, Sept/Oct 2011 . 4   Another reason to desire growth is that economies tend to favour insiders – those who have jobs for example. T he brunt of the joblessness caused by slow growth is born by new entrants to the labour market.  Not only are they unemployed in larger numbers, but the lifetime earnings of cohorts that enter the labour force in difficult times is lower. Growth is necessar y for inter -generational equity, especially because these are the generations that will be working to pay off commitments to older generations.  Given these are also the cohorts that can take to the streets, growth is essential for social harmony.  Not only are the benefits of growth unequally distributed across generations, they are also very unequally distributed within generation. Because of changes in technology and the expansion of global competition, routine repetitive jobs, whether done by the skilled or the unskilled, have diminished greatly in industrial countries. Many of these jobs, ranging from assembly line worker to legal aides or insurance clerks, have either been automated or outsourced. The desirable high -paying jobs are non -routine skilled on es such as that of a consultant or an app designer, but they require skills.  T he middle class recognizes that they need quality higher education and training to not slip into competing with the poor for low -skilled non -routine jobs such as security guard or gardener. B ut the poor quality early education they have received, as well as the prohibitive cost of quality higher education, puts many  better livelihoods  out of reach. With every percentage point of growth creating fewer “good” jobs for the unskilled  or moderately skilled, more growth is needed to keep them happily employed. Equally, the rapid deterioration in skills for the unemployed is an additional reason to push for growth.  The Deflation Fear    Finally, a big factor persuading authorities in indu strial countries to push for higher growth is the fear of deflation. The canonical example here is Japan, where many are persuaded that the key mistake it made was to slip into deflation, which has persisted and held back growth.  A closer look at the Japa nese experience suggests th at it is by no means clear that its growth has been slower than warranted let alone that deflation caused slow growth. It is true that after its devastating crisis in the early 1990s, Japan may have prolonged the slowdown by not taking early action  to clean up its banking system or restructure over -indebted corporations. But once it took decisive action in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Japanese growth per capita or per worker looks comparable with other industrial countries  (Table 1).8 Slow aggregate Japanese economic growth may simply be because its population is shrinking, and fewer people are entering the labour force  rather than because it is underperforming other developed economies .                                                             8 I first learnt of these facts from Jean Claude Trichet.  For a more  comprehensive look at deflation, see Claudio Borio, Magdalena Erdem , Andrew Filardo  and Boris Hofmann , “The costs of deflations: a historical perspective ”, BIS Quarterly Review March 2015 .    5    Source. World Economic Outlook Database , IMF .  What about the deleterious effects of deflation? One worrisome effect of deflation is that if wages are downwardly -sticky, real wages rise and cause unemployment. Yet Japanese unemployment has average d 4.5%  between 2000 -2014 , compared to 6.4%  in th e US and 9.4%  in the Euro area  during the same period .9 In part, the Japanese have obtained wage flexibility by moving away from the old lifetime unemployment contracts for new hires to short term contracts.  Indeed, with the decline in union power across i ndustrial countries  and the increase in temporary or even “zero hour” workers , downward wage flexibility may be significantly higher than previously estimated . While not without social costs, such flexibility allows an economy to cope with sustained deflat ion. Another concern has been that moderately low inflation spirals down into seriously large deflation, where the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates keeps real interest rates unconscionably high. Once again, it is not clear this happened in Japan.  In the years 1999  to 2012 , average CPI deflation ranged between  -0.01%  in 2004 to -1.3% in 2009 , but without any clear spiralling pattern  (Figure 1 ).  Source: World Economic Outlook  Database, IMF.                                                               9 Source. World Economic Outlook Database, IMF.  6   Even if deflation  is moderate , it may cause customers to  postpone purchases and increase savings in anticipation of a lower price in the future , especially if the zero lower bound raises real interest rates above their desired value. In Fig 2, we plot household savings as a share of GDP in Japan against the de flation rate . Again, it is hard to see a sustained pattern of higher savings with higher deflation . 0\t2\t4\t6\t8\t10\t12\t0\t 0.2\t 0.4\t 0.6\t 0.8\t 1\t 1.2\t 1.4\t 1.6\tDeflaon\tRate\t(in\t%)\tFigure\t2.\tHousehold\tSavings\tand\tDeflaon\tRate:\tJapan\tHousehold\tsavings/GDP\t Source: World Economic Outlook  Database, IMF. This chart plots the deflation  rates and savings ratios for Japan for all years  with negative inflation rates  since 1980 – 1995, 1999, 2000 -2005, 2009 -2014 .  Finally, it is true that deflation increases the real burden of existing debt, thus exacerbating debt overhang. But this is true of any unanticipated disinflation, and is not specific to deflation. If debt i s excessive, a targeted restructuring is better than inflating it away across the board.  Regardless  of all these arguments , the spectre of deflation haunts central bankers . When coupled with the other political concerns raised by slow and unequal growth li sted above, it is no wonder that the authorities in developed countries do not want to settle for low growth, even if that is indeed their economy’s potential.  So the central dilemma in industrial economies has been how to reconcile the political imperativ e for strong growth with the reality that cyclical stimulus measures have proved ineffective in restoring high growth, debt write -offs are politically unacceptable, and structural reforms have the wrong timing, politically speaking, of pain versus gain. There is, however, one other channel for growth – exports.  Emerging Market Response  If industrial countries are stuck in low growth, can emerging markets (I use the term broadly to also stand for developing or frontier markets) take up the global slack in de mand? After all, emerging markets have a clear need for infrastructure investment, as well as growing 7   populations that can be a source of final demand. Why cannot industrial countries export to emerging markets  as a way to bolster growth?  After all, they h ave done so in the past.  Emerging markets have no less of an imperative for growth than industrial countries. While many do not have past entitlement promises to deliver on, some have ageing populations that have to be provided for, and many have young, po or, populations with sky -high expectations of growth. Ideally, emerging markets would invest for the future, funded by the rich world, thus bolstering aggregate world demand .   The 1990s were indeed a period when emerging markets borrowed from the rest of the world in attempting to finance infrastructure and development. It did not end well, with credit booms, large unviable prestige projects, and eventual busts. The Mexican Crisis of 1994, the Asian  Crisis of 1997 -98, and the Argentinian Crisis of 2001 hig hlighted the inability of emerging markets to manage large increases in domestic investment funded by foreign capital inflows. The lesson from the 1990s crises was that emerging market reliance on foreign capital for growth was dangerous . With investment  prudently  limited to domestic savings, this naturally curtailed  their ability to serve as growth engines for the world.     -2\t-1\t0\t1\t2\t3\t4\t5\t6\t1995\t1996\t1997\t1998\t1999\t2000\t2001\t2002\t2003\t2004\t2005\t2006\t2007\t2008\t2009\t2010\t2011\t2012\t2013\t2014\t%\tof\tGDP\tCurrent\tAccount\tBalance\t(as\t%\tof\tGDP)\tAdvanced\t Emerging\t1997\t2006\t2014\t Source: World Economic Outlook Database, April 2015. Emerging economies include “emerging and developing” countries.  Following the  1990s crises, as the dotted line in Figure 3 indicates, a  number of emerging markets went further to run current account surpluses after cutting investment  sharply , and started accumulating foreign exchange reserves to preserve exchange competitiveness. Rather than generating excess demand for the world’s goods, they became suppliers (or equivalently, savers), searching for demand elsewhere. And the debt -fuelled demand from the industrial Figure 3:  8   countries before the Global Financial Crisis , as indicated by their current account deficits,  spilled over into a demand for emerging market goods. The years before the crisis were years of plenty for countries like China that catered directly to industrial country demand, and countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America that sold commodities and intermediate goods to the direct suppliers.  In 2005, Ben Bernanke, then a governor at the Federal Reserve, coined the term “Global Savings Glut” to describe the current account surpluses, especially of emerging markets, that were finding their way into the United States.10 He argued that these depressed U.S. interest rates, enhancing consumption, and the U.S. current account deficit. Bernanke pointed to a number of adverse consequences to the United States from these flows including  the misallocation of resources to non -traded goods like housing away from tradable manufacturing. He suggested that it would be good if United States ’ current account deficit shrank, but that primarily required emerging markets to reduce their exchange ra te intervention rather than actions on the part of the United States.  So pre -global financial crisis, emerging markets and industrial countries were locked in a dangerous relationship of capital flows and demand that reversed the equally dangerous pattern  before the emerging market crises in the late 1990s. Sustained exchange rate intervention by emerging market central banks, as well as an excessive tolerance for leverage in industrial countries contributed to the eventual global disaster. But post -financ ial crisis, the pattern is reversing  once again.  Post global financial crisis , much like the emerging markets in the early 2000s, industrial countries have curtailed their investment without increasing their consumption (as a fraction of GDP), thus reduci ng their demand for foreign goods and their reliance on foreign finance. Indeed, as the solid line in Figure 3 indicates, advanced economies ran current account surpluses in 2013 and were also projected to do so in 2014, a shift in current account balances  of about 1.5 percentage points of GDP since 2008.    The counterpart of this shift of advanced economies from current account deficit (demand creating) to surplus (supply creating) has been a substantial fall in current account surpluses in emerging market s over the same period. This relative increase in demand for foreign goods from emerging markets has come about through a ramp up in investment from 2008, rather than a fall in savings – a shift of 2.7 percentage points of GDP in current account balances between 2008 and 2014. Facilitating or causing this shift has been a broad appreciation of real effective exchange rates in emerging markets and a depreciation in industrial country rates between 2006 -2014.                                                                 10 “The Global Saving G lut and the U.S. Current Account Deficit”, remarks by Governor Bernanke at the Sandridge Lecture, Virginia Association of Economists, Richmond, Virginia  on  March 10, 2005, http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/200503102/  Figure 4 : Real Effective Exchange Rate Movements 2006-2014      Source. IMF   Have industrial country central banks  policies , similar to the sustained exchange rate intervention by emerging market central banks in the early 2000s , accelerated this current account adjustment? Possibly, and likely candidates would be what are broadly called unconventional monetary policies (UMP) . Unconventional Monetary Policy Unconventional monetary policies  include both policies where the central bank  attempts to commit to hold interest rates at near zero for long, as well as policies that affect central bank balance sheets such as buying assets in certain markets, including exchange markets, in order  to affect market  prices.11   There clearly is a role for unconventional policies – when markets are broken or grossly dysfunctional, central banke rs may step in with their balance sheets to mend markets . The key question is what happens when these policies are prolonged long beyond repairing markets  to actually distorting them. The benefit to cost ratio there is less clear.  Take, for instan ce, the zero -lower -bound problem. Because short term policy rates cannot be pushed much below zero, and because long rates tack on a risk premium to short rates, central banks may use UMP to directly affect long rates. Direct action by a risk tolerant cen tral bank , such as purchasing long bonds, effectively shrinks the risk premium available on remaining long assets.12  This has two effects. First, those who can rebalance between short and long assets now prefer holding short term assets because, risk adjust ed, these are a better deal. Thus as the central bank increases bond purchases under quantitative easing , the willingness  of commercial banks to hold unremunerated reserves r ather than long term assets  increases. Second, those institutions that cannot shif t to short term assets , such as pension funds, bond mutual funds, and insurance companies , will either continue holding their assets and suffer a relative under -compensation for risk, or turn to riskier assets . This behaviour, also termed the search for yield, will occur if  the relative under -compensation for risk in more exotic  assets is lower , or 11 For an excellent overview, see Claudio Borio and P. Disyatat, ""Unconventional monetary policies: An appraisal "", The Manchester School; Vol. 78 , Issue s1, pp. 53 -89, September 2010  12 For instance, because the most risk averse holders of existing long bonds sell first and move to holding short term assets.  9                                                              10   simply because institutions  have to meet a fixed nominal rate of return constraint on their portfolios. Of course, such portfolio rebalan cing wil l also take place  because the central bank buys long duration bonds out of institutional  portfolios, leaving them cash to redeploy.  None of this need be a problem if everyone knows w hen to stop. Unfortunately , there are few constraints on central banks und ertaking these policies since they are self -financing (commercial banks become more willing to hold central bank reserves  as the risk premium on long bonds shrinks ). If the po licy does not seem to be increasing growth , one can simply do more. All the while , the distortion  in asset prices and the mis-allocation of funds can increase, which can be very costly when the central bank decides to exit.  Equally important though , is that domestic fund managers can search for yield abroad , depreciating the sending c ountry’s currency and causing the receiving country’s currency to appreciate , perhaps significantly more so than ordinary monetary policy . This may indeed cause the increase in domestic competitiveness that could energize the sending country’s exports.  But such increases in competitiveness  and “demand shifting” can be very detrimental for global stability,  especially if unaccompanied by domestic demand creation.     Spill Overs to Emerging Markets  and Musical Crises  If UMP enhances financial risk taking in the originating country without enhancing domestic investment or consumption, the exchange rate impact of UMP may simply shift demand away from countries not engaging in UMP, without creating much compensating domestic demand  for their goods . If so, UMP wo uld resemble very much the exchange rate intervention policies of the emerging markets pre -global financial crisis.   Indeed, the post -global crisis capit al flows into emerging markets have been huge, despite the best efforts of emerging markets to push the m back by accumulating reserves  (net capital flows to emerging economies reached US$ 550 bn in 2013 compared to US$120 bn in 2006) .13 14 These flows have increase d local leverage , not just due to the direct effect of cross -border banking flows but also the i ndirect effect, as the appreciating exchange rate and rising asset prices, especially of  real estate, make it seem that emerging market borrowers have more equity than they really have. Bernanke’s  concerns in 2005 about mal -investment  in the United State s resulting from capital i nflows from emerging markets have surfaced  in emerging markets post -crisis  as a result of capital inflows from industrial countries.   Have  crises in emerging markets in the 1990s been transformed into crises in industrial countries  in the 2000s  and once again into vulnerabilities in emerging markets  in the 2010s , as countries react to the problem of inadequate global demand by exporting their problems to other countries? The “taper tantrum” in July 201 3 certainly seemed to suggest t hat emerging markets that ran large current account deficits were vulnerable once again .15  Is the world                                                             13 Based on the World Economic Outlook database. Emerging economies include “emerging and developing” countries. Net capital flows include net direct investment, net protfolio investment, and “other” net investment.  14 Inde ed, similar to the behavior of commercial banks, the willingness of emerging market central banks to hold short term paper in response to capital inflows enhances the ability of the industrial country central bank to engage in further UMP. In a sense, emer ging market central banks provide liquidity for foreign investors by holding precautionary reserves.    15 For those who advocate allowing exchange rate adjustment as central to macro -management, it should be sobering that countries that allowed the real ex change rate to appreciate the most during the prior period of quantitative easing suffered the greatest adverse  impact to financial conditions (see Eichengreen, Barry and Poonam Gupta (2013), “Tapering Talk: The Impact of Expectations of Reduced Federal 11   engaged in a macabr e game of musical crises  as each country attempts to boost growth ? If possibly yes, as suggested by the previous discussion, how do w e break this cycle?  Good Policies…and Good Behaviour  In an ideal world, the political imperative for growth would not outstrip the economy’s potential. Given that we do not live in such a world, and given that social security commitments, over -indebtedness , and poverty are not going to disappear , it is probably wiser to look for ways to enhance sustainable growth.  Clearly, the long run response to weak global growth should be  policies that promote innovation as well as  structural reforms that enhanc e effic iency. Given that growth within countries is poorly distributed, policies that improve the domestic distribution of capabilities and opportunities without significantly dampening incentives for innovation and efficiency are also needed.  In the short run t hough, the need for sensible investment is paramount. In industrial countries, green energy initiatives  such as carbon taxes or emission limits, while giving industry clear signals on where to invest,  also have the ability to move the needle  on aggregate i nvestment and help long run goals on environment protection.  Most emerging markets have large infrastructure investment needs. We still need to understand how to improve project selection and finance  – too much public sector involvement results in sloth a nd rent seeking, too much private sector involvement leads to risk intolerance and profiteering.  Going forward, well -designed public  private partnerships , drawing on successful experiences elsewhere, should complement private initiative .  The Australian P residency of  the G 20  created a welcome mechanism to share be st investment practices  across countries. At the same time, we must recognize that large scale investment projects need patient risk capital, which is in short supply in emerging markets. Private  investors rarely have the risk tolerance that governments or multilateral institutions have. So, in addition to knowledge sharing, global growth would benefit from an augmentation of the capital base of multilateral institutions like the World Bank, the A frican Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank, so that they can provide part of the patient risk tolerant capital the emerging world needs.  Despite competing domestic demands, industrial countries should recognize the important catalytic role tha t the development banks can play and help bolster their capital . At the very least, they should not stand in the way of others augmenting capital and taking more ownership.  Clearly, s ensible investment has a much better chance of paying dividends when macroeconomic policies are sound. And such policies are easier when the adverse spill overs from cross -border capital flows are limited.  This may require new rules of the game for policy making.  New Rules of the Game?  How do we focus on domestic demand creat ion and avoid this game of musical crises  with countries trying to depreciate their exchange rate through sustained direct exchange rate                                                                                                                                                                                          Reserve Security Purchases on Emerging Markets”, Working Paper, Uni versity of California, Berkeley and Mishra, Prachi, Kenji Moriyama, Papa N’Diaye and Lam Nguyen (2014), “The Impact of Fed Tapering Announcements on Emerging Markets”, IMF working paper ). 12   intervention or through unconventional monetary policies  (where demand creating transmission channels are blocked) ?16 It might be useful to examine and challenge the  rationales used to justify such actions.  Rationale 1 : Would the world not be better off if we grew strongly?  Undoubtedly, if there were no negative spill overs from a country’s actions, the world would indeed  be better off if the country grew. But the whole poi nt about policies that primarily affect domestic growth by depreciating the domestic exchange rate is that they work by pulling growth from others, not creating growth for others.   Rationale 2: We are in  a deep recession. We need to use any means available to jump start growth. Once we get out of recession, the payoff for other countries from our growth will be considerable.  This may be a legitimate rationale if the  policy is a “one -off” and once the coun try gets out of its growth funk, it is willing to let its currency app reciate so that it absorbs imports , thus pulling other countries with it. But if the strengthening currency leads to a continuation of the unconventional policies as the country’s author ities become unwilling to give back the growth they obtained by undervaluing their currency, or if the strengthening currency leads to greater domestic political clamour about foreign countries undervaluing their currencies, this rationale is suspect.  More over, policies that encourage  sustained unidirectional capital outflows to other countries can be very debilitating for the recipient’s financial stability, over and above any effects on their competitiveness. Thus any “one -off” has to be limited in durati on. Rationale 3:  Our domestic mandate requires us to do what it takes to fulfil our inflation objective, and unconventional monetary policy is indeed necessary when we hit against the zero lower bound.  This rationale has two weaknesses.  First, it places  a domestic mandate above an international responsibility. If this were seen to be legitimate, then no country would ever respect international responsibilities when inconvenient. Second, it implicitly assumes that the only way to achieve the inflation man date is through unconventional monetary policy  (even assuming UMPs are successful in elevating inflation on a sustained basis, for which there is little evidence) .  Rationale 4 : We take into account the feedback effects to our economy from the rest of the world while setting policy. Therefore, we are not oblivious to the consequences of unconventional monetary policies on other countries.  Ideally, responsible global citizenship would require a country to act as it would act in a world without boundaries. In  such a world, a policy maker should judge whether the overall positive domestic and international benefits of a policy , discounted over time , outweigh its costs. Some policies may have largely domestic benefits and foreign costs, but they may be reasonabl e in a world without boundaries because more people are benefited than are hurt.                                                              16 See also a very thoughtful piece by Fabrizio Saccomanni , “Monetary spillovers? Boom and bust? Currency wars? ”, The international monetary system strikes back ”, BIS Special Governors Meeting, Manila, February 2015.    13   By this definition, Rationale 4 does  not necessarily amount to responsible global citizenship because a country only takes into account the global “spillbacks” to itself from  any policies it undertakes, instead of the spill overs also. So, for example, Country A may destroy industry I in country B  through its policies, but will only take into accou nt the spillback from industry I  purchasing less of country A’s exports.    Rationale 5 : Monetary policy with a domestic focus is already very complicated and hard to communicate. It would be impossibly complex if we were additionally burdened with having to think about the effects of (unconventional) monetary policies o n other countr ies. This widely -heard rationale is really an abandonment of responsibility. It amounts to asserting that the monetary authority only has a domestic mandate, which is Rationale 3 above. In an interconnected  globalized world, “complexity”  cannot be a defens e.  Rationale 6: We will do what we must, y ou can adj ust. Adjustments are never easy, and sometimes very costly  – one reason why Ben Bernanke placed the burden of change in his “Savings Glut” speech outside the United States . Emerging markets may not have the institutions that can weather the  exchange rate volatility  and credit growth associated with large capital flows  – for instance, sharp exchange rate depreciation s can translate quickly into inflation  if the emerging market central bank does not have cr edibility , while exchange rate depreciations may be more easily endured by an industrial country.    The bottom line is that multilateral institutions like the IMF should re -examine the “rules of the game” for responsible policy , and develop a consensus ar ound new ones . No matter what a central bank ’s domestic mandate, international responsibilities should not be ignored. The IMF should analyze each new unconventional monetary policy (including sustained unidirectional exchange rate intervention), and based  on their effects and the agreed rules of the game, d eclare them in - or out -of-bounds. By halting policies that primarily work through the exchange rate, it will also contribute to solving a classic Prisoner’s Dilemma problem associated with policies that depreciate the exchange rate -- once some countries undertake these polic ies, staying out is difficult (the country that eschews these policies sees its currency appreciate and demand fall) . Exit is also difficult (the exiting count ry faces sharp appreciat ion). Therefore,  in the absence of collective action, these policies will be undertaken even when sub -optimal, and will carry on too long.    Of cou rse, with country authorities in almost every industrial country focused on appeasing populist anti -trade an ti-finance (and anti -central bank) political movements, there is little appetite for taking on further international commitments. We clearly need further dialogue and public debate on the issues that have been raised, while recognizing that progress will require strong political leadership.     International Safety Nets  Emerging economies have to work to reduce vulnerabilities in their economies, to get to the point where, like Australia or Canada, they can allow exchange rate flexibility to do much of the adjustment for them to capital inflows. But the needed institutions take time to develop. In the meantime, the difficulty for emerging markets in absorbing large amounts of capital quickly and in a stable way should be seen as a constraint, much like the z ero lower bound, rather than something that can be altered quickly.  Even while resisting the te mptation of absorbing flows, emerging markets  will look to safety nets.  14   So another way to prevent  a repeat of substantial emerging market reserve accumulation , this time for precautionary rather than competitive purposes,  is to build stronger international safety nets. For instance , one possibility  is an unsolicited  liquidity line from the IMF, where countries are pre -qualified by the IMF and told (perhaps private ly) how much of a line they would qualify for under current policy – with access limits revised in the annual dialogue the Fund has with a country, and any curtailment becoming effective 6 months later. Access to the line would get activated by the IMF Boa rd in a situation of generalized liquidity shortage (as, for example, when policy tightening in source countries after an extended period of low rates causes investment managers to become risk averse).   In turn, the Fund could finance this liquidity by in termediating swaps with central banks (and thus guaranteeing central banks against default). Such proposals allow countries access to liquidity without the stigma of approaching the Fund, and without the conditionality that accompanies most Fund arrangemen ts, and thus are more likely to be acceptable as precautionary measures .  It would also be a useful exercise for the Fund, in a period of growing vulnerability to cap ital flow reversals, to determine  those countries that do not have own, bilateral, regiona l, or multilateral liquidity arrangements to fall back on, and to work to improve their access to some safety net.  Conclusion  The current non -system in international monetary policy is, in my view, a source of substantial risk, both to sustainable growth as well as to the financial sector. It is not an industrial country problem, nor an emerging market problem, it is a problem of collective action. We are being pushed towards competitive monetary easing  and musical crises .  I use Depression era terminology  because I fear that in a world with weak aggregate deman d, we may be engaged in a risky  competition for a greate r share of it. W e are thereby also creating financial sector risks for when  unconventional policies end.  We need stronger well -capitalized mul tilateral institutions with widespread legitimacy, some of which can provide patient capital and others that can monitor new rules of the game. We also need better international safety nets. And each one of us has to work hard in our own countries to devel op a consensus for free trade, open markets, and responsible global citizenry. If we can achieve all this even as recent economic events make us more parochial and inward -looking, we will truly have set the stage for the strong sustainable growth we all  desperately  need.

I did not have the privilege of meeting or in teracting with late Shri Palkhivala. He was already a preeminent public intell ectual in the country by the time I had entered the IAS in the early 1970s. But I count myself among the millions  of educated Indians who were deeply impressed by Shri Palkhivala’s commitment to pr otecting India’s democratic  institutions, and the intellectual vigour with which he did so. In a car eer spanning over six decades, he distinguished himself as a brilliant lawyer, a perceptive political scientist, an intelligent communicator and an erudite diplomat, leaving behind a legacy that continues to influence our public discourse in several areas.     \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa01 Tenth Nani A. Palkhivala Memorial Lecture delivered by Dr. Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India in Mumbai on August 29, 2013. Topic of My Lecture 3. I deliberated quite a bit on an appropriate topic for a lecture to honour the memory of such an eminent public intellectual.  I was also conscious of the fact  that this will be my last public lecture as the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Quite understandably, given the Palkhivala context, my t houghts started centering around the role and responsibility of a central bank in a democratic structure. Ce ntral banks make macr oeconomic policy that influences the everyday life of people; yet they are managed by unelected officials appointed by the government. Such an arrangement is deliberate , based on the logic that an apolitical central bank, operating autonomously within a statutorily  prescribed mandate and with a longer time perspective, is an effective counterpoise to a democratically elected gov ernment which typically operates with a political mandate within the time horizon of an electoral cycle.   4. An autonomous and apolitical  central bank is a delicate arrangement too, and will work only if the government respects the autonomy of  the central bank, and the central bank itself stays within its mandate, delivers on that mandate  and renders accountability for the outcomes of its policies and actions.   5. Putting the three elements of today’s lect ure context together - Shri Palkhivala’s exemplary commitment to preserve and promote va lues and institutions of democracy in India; the Reserve Bank’s role in the democratic edifice of India; and the completion of my term as the Governor of the Reserve Bank - I determined th at the best way I can pay tribute to Shri Palkhivala is to focus on a topic that threads together these three elements. That explains my topic for today: ‘Five Years of Leading the Reserve Bank: Looking Ahead by Looking Back’.    2\xa0\xa0“May you live in interesting times!” 6. The Chinese have an adage: “May you live in interesting times.” I can hardly complain on that count. I had come into the Reserve Ba nk five years ago as the ‘Great Recession’ was setting in, and I am finishing now as the ‘Great Ex it’ is taking shape, with not a week of respite from the crisis over the five years.  7. From a central banking perspectiv e, history will mark the last five years for two distinct developments. The first is the extraordinary s how of policy force with  which central banks responded to the global financial crisis. This has generated a vi gorous debate on the short-term and long term implications of unc onventional monetary policies as also on the responsibility of central banks for the cro ss border spillover impact of their policies. The second historical marker will be the manner in which, reflecting the less ons of the crisis, the mandate, autonomy and accountability of central banks are being rede fined in several countries around the world. Notwithstanding all the tensions and anxietie s of policy management during an admittedly challenging period, I consider myself privileged to have led one of the finest central banks in the world during such an inte llectually vigorous period.  8. Against that context, I want  to divide my lecture today on “Five Years of Leading the Reserve Bank: Looking Ahead by Looking Back” into two segments. In the first segment, I want to look back over the last five years and give my assessment of the macroeconomic developments during this period and the Reserve Bank’s response. In the second segment, I will address the major challenges for the Reserve Bank on the way forward.      3\xa0\xa0I.  Macroeconomic Developments Over the  Last Five Years and RBI’s Response    9. For analytical purposes, macroeconomic deve lopments over the last five years can be divided into three distinct phase s: (i) The global financial crisis  and RBI’s response; (ii) Exit from the crisis and RBI’s struggle with growth -inflation dynamics; and (iii) The external sector strains which have accentuated over the last few months and RBI’s efforts to restore stability in the currency market.   First Phase (2008/09) - Crisis Management 10. Given all the water that has flown under the bridge since then, the Lehman crisis of 2008 seems an eternity away. Yet, that was the reality that I faced within less than two weeks of taking over as Governor. My intent here is not to rehash  the events of those days, but try and put that crisis - and therefore the polic y response - in perspective.  11. In order to appreciate that perspective, just  throw your mind back to those heady days of 2008. Recall that India was on the ve rge of being christened the next miracle economy. Growth was surging along at 9 per cent. Fiscal deficit was on the mend. The rupee was appreciating and asset prices were rising. There were inflatio n pressures but the gene ral perception was that inflation was a problem of success, not of failure. Most importantly, we thought we had ‘decoupled’ - that even if advanced economie s went into a down turn, emerging market economies will not be affected because of th eir improved macroeconomic management, robust external reserves and sound banking sectors.   12. The crisis dented, if not fully  discredited, the dec oupling hypothesis. It affected virtually every country in the world, including India. So, why did India get hit? Th e reason was that by 4\xa0\xa02008, India was more integrated into the global  economy than we recognized. India’s two way trade (merchandize exports plus imports), as a proportion to GDP, more than doubled over the past decade: from about 20 per cent in 1998/99, the year of the Asian crisis, to over 40 per cent in 2008/09, the year of the global crisis.   13. If our trade integration was deep, our financ ial integration was even deeper. A measure of financial integration is the ratio of total extern al transactions (gross current account flows plus gross capital account flows) to GDP. This rati o had more than doubled from 44 per cent in 1998/99 to 112 per cent in 2008/09, evidencing the depth of Indi a’s financial integration.  14. What this meant was that as the global financial and economic conditions went into a turmoil, we were affected through trade, fina nce and confidence channels. The Reserve Bank responded to the crisis with al acrity, with policies aimed at keeping our financial markets functioning, providing adequate ru pee liquidity, and maintaining the flow of credit to the productive sectors of the economy.   Lessons in Crisis Management 15. As someone said, this crisis was too valuable  to waste. In the event, we learnt several lessons in crisis management. I will only list the important ones. First, we learnt that in a global environment of such uncertainty and unpredictability, policy action has to be swift, certain and reassuring. Also, during crisis times, it helps en ormously if governments and central banks act, and are seen to be acting, in  concert. Second, we learnt that action is important, but communication is even more important. When th e economic environment is uncertain, market players and economic agents look up to governments and central banks for both reassurance and 5\xa0\xa0clarity. Indeed, communication was a critical tool all central banks, including India, adopted in those heady autumn days of 2008.   16. The third lesson we learnt is that even in a multi-nation crisis, governments and central banks have to adapt their response to domestic conditions. There is typically pressure on every country to copy the crisis response  of other countries, especially  of advanced economies (AEs). For example, AEs were forced to resort to quantitative easing (QE) to loosen monetary conditions, raise inflation expectations and lower real interest rates. Was there any need for emerging market (EM) central bank s to do so? I believe there wasn’t because they had sufficient conventional ammunition left. Instead, what we had to show was that we were fully prepared to use it.   17. While on the subject of crisis, I also wa nt to share with you a dilemma. Crisis management is a percentage game. We have to do what we think has the be st chance of reversing the momentum. At the same time, we have to we igh the short-term bene fits against the longer term consequences, including moral hazards. In 2008, massive infusion of liquidity was seen as the best bet. Indeed, in uncharted waters, erring on the side of caution meant providing the system with more liquidity than  considered adequate. This stra tegy was effective in the short-term, but with hindsight, we know that excess liqu idity may have reinforced inflation pressures. In the thick of the crisis, the judgement call we  had to make was about balancing the benefits from preventing a crisis against the costs of pot ential inflation down the line. Remember we were acting in real time. Analysts who are criticising us are doing so with the benefit of hindsight.     6\xa0\xa0Second Phase (2010/11) - Exit from the Crisis 18. India recovered from the crisis sooner than  even other emerging economies, but inflation too caught up with us sooner than elsewhere. Inflation, as m easured by the wholesale price index (WPI), which actually went  into negative territory for a brief period in mid-2009, started rising in late 2009, and had remained around  9-10 per cent for all of 2010 and much of 2011, reflecting both supply and demand pressure s. Supply pressures stemmed fr om elevated domestic food prices and rising global prices of oil and ot her commodities. Demand pressures stemmed from rising incomes and sudden release of pent up demand as recovery began. The supply shocks and demand pressures combined to tr igger a wider inflationary proc ess. We were caught in the quintessential central banking dilemma of  balancing growth and inflation. 19. In response to the inflation pressures, th e Reserve Bank reversed  its crisis driven accommodative monetary policy as early as October 2009 and started tightening. We have been criticized for our anti-inflationary stance, ironically from two opposite directions. From one side, there were critics who argued that we were too so ft on inflation, that we were late in recognizing the inflation pressures, and that even after recognizing such pre ssures, our ‘baby step’ tightening was a timid and hesitant response. Had the Re serve Bank acted quickly and more decisively, inflation could have been brought under control much sooner. From the other side of the spectrum, we were criticized for being too ha wkish, mainly on the argument that there was no need for the Reserve Bank to respond to inflation driven largely by food and supply shocks, and that we only ended up stifling growth without easing inflation pressures.   20. Let me respond to this criticism from both ends of the spectrum.  7\xa0\xa021. To those who say that we were behind the cu rve, my simple response is to recall the context of the years 2010 and 2011. Much of the wo rld was still in a crisis mode, the eurozone crisis was in full bloom and there was a lot of uncertainty globally. And as we learnt from the experience of the 2008 Lehman episode, we re mained vulnerable to adverse external developments. Our ‘baby steps’ were therefor e a delicate balancing act  between preserving growth on the one hand and restra ining inflation on the other.  22. With the benefit of hindsight , of course, I must admit in all honesty that  the economy would have been better served if our monetary tightening had started sooner and had been faster and stronger. Why do I say that? I say that because  we now know that we had a classic V-shaped recovery from the crisis, that grow th had not dipped in the Lehman crisis year as low as had been feared, and that growth in the subsequent two years was stronger th an earlier thought. But remember, all this is hindsight whereas we were  making policy in real ti me, operating within the universe of knowledge at that time.  Just as an aside, this epis ode highlights the importance of faster and more reliable economic data fo r effective monetary policy calibration.   23. Let me now respond to the doves who argue th at the Reserve Bank was too hawkish in its anti-inflationary stance.   24. First, I do not agree with the argument that  the Reserve Bank failed to control inflation but only ended up stifling growth. WPI inflati on has come down from double digits to around 5 per cent; core inflation has de clined to around 2 per cent. Yes, growth has moderated, but to attribute all of that moderation to tight mone tary policy would be inaccurate, unfair, and importantly, misleading as a policy lesson. India’ s economic activity slowed owing to a host of supply side constraints and governance issues, cl early beyond the purview of the Reserve Bank. 8\xa0\xa0If the Reserve Bank’s repo rate was the only f actor inhibiting growth, growth should have responded to our rate cuts of 125 bps betw een April 2012 and May 2013, CRR cut of 200 bps and open market operations (OMOs) of `1.5  trillion last year.   25. Admittedly, some growth slowdown is attribut able to monetary tightening. Note that the objective of monetary tightening is to compress aggregate demand, and so some sacrifice of growth is programmed into monetary  tightening. But this sacrifice is only in the short-term; there is no sacrifice in the medium term. Indeed, low and steady inflation is a necessary precondition for sustained growth. Any growth sacrifice in the short term w ould be more than offset by sustained medium term growth. I want to reit erate once again that th e Reserve Bank had run a tight monetary policy not because it does not  care for growth, but because it does  care for growth.  26. Critics of our monetary tightening must also note that our degrees of freedom were curtailed by the loose fiscal stance of the government during 2009-12. Had the fiscal consolidation been faster, it is possible that monetary policy calibration could have been less tight.   27. And now let me respond to the criticism that  monetary policy is an ineffective tool against supply shocks. This is an ageless and time less issue. I am not the first Governor to have to respond to this, and I know I won’t be the last. My response s hould come as no surprise. In a $1500 per-capita economy - where food is a large fraction of the expend iture basket - food inflation quickly spills into wa ge inflation, and therefore into core inflation. Indeed, this transmission was institutionalized in the ru ral areas where MGNREGA wages are formally 9\xa0\xa0indexed to inflation. Besides, when food is su ch a dominant share of the expenditure basket, sustained food inflation is bound to i gnite inflationary expectations.   28. As it turned out, bo th these phenomena did play out - wages and inflation expectations began to rise. More generally, th is was all against a context of  consumption-led growth, large fiscal deficits, and increased implementation bottlenecks. If ever there was a potent cocktail for core inflation to rise this was it. And it did - rising from under 3 per cent at the start of 2010 to almost 8 per cent by the end of the next year. It is against this backdrop that our anti-inflationary stance in 2010 and 2011 needs to be evaluated.   Third Phase (2012/13) - Pressures  in the External Sector  29. Remember, I began my speech with the old Ch inese saying - “May you live in interesting times.” So, as inflation began to moderate yiel ding space for monetary easing to support growth, we got caught up with external s ector strains over the last two years and a sharp depreciation of the rupee over the last three months. There has been dismay about the ferocity of depreciation; there has also been a growing tendency to attribute all of this to the ‘tapering’ of its ultra easy monetary policy by the US Fed.   30. Such a diagnosis, I believe, is misleading. Admittedly, the speed and timing of the rupee depreciation have been due to the markets factor ing in ‘tapering’ by the US Fed, but we will go astray both in the diagnosis and remedy, if we do not acknowledge that the root cause of the problem is domestic structural factors.   31. What are these structural factors? At its r oot, the problem is that we have been running a current account deficit (CAD) we ll above the sustainable level fo r three years in a row, and 10\xa0\xa0possibly for a fourth year this year.  We were  able to finance the C AD because of the easy liquidity in the global system. Had we used the breathing time that  this gave us to address the structural factors and brought the CAD down to its sustainable level,  we would have been able to withstand the ‘taper’. In  the event, we did not. We therefor e made ourselves vulnerable to sudden stop and exit of capital flows driven by global se ntiment; the eventual cost of adjustment too went up sharply.  32. But what drives the CAD so high? Basic ec onomics tells us that the CAD rises when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply. Ther e is an argument that this logic is not applicable to us in the current juncture given the sharp slow down in gr owth. But we need to recognize that the CAD can increase substantially even in a low growth environment if supply constraints impact both growth and external  trade as has been the case with us.   33. The only lasting solution to our external s ector problem is to reduce the CAD to its sustainable level and to finance the reduced CAD through stable, and to the extent possible, non-debt flows. Reducing the CAD requires structural solutions - RBI has very little policy space or instruments to deliver the needed structural  solution. They fall with in the ambit of the government. Structural adjustment will also take tim e. In the interim, we need to stabilize the market volatility, a task that falls within the domain of the Reserve Bank.   34. It is the avowed policy of the Reserve Bank not to target a level of exchange rate and we have stayed true to that policy. Our efforts over the last few years, particularly the last three months, have been to smoothen volatility as the exchange rate adjusts to its market determined level so as to make the near-term cost of ad justment less onerous for firms, households and banks. 11\xa0\xa0  35. There has been criticism th at the Reserve Bank’s policy me asures have been confusing and betray a lack of resolve to curb exchange rate  volatility. Let me first of all reiterate that our commitment to curbing volatility in the exchange rate is total and unequivocal. I admit that we could have communicated the rationale of our measures more effectively.   36. But our actions were consiste nt. Our capital account measures  were aimed at encouraging inflows and discouraging outflows. Also, we tightened liquidity at the short end to raise the cost of short-term money so as to curb volatility.  At the same time, we wanted to inhibit the transmission of the interest rate  signal from the short end to th e long end as that would hurt flow of credit to the productive sect or of the economy. So, we inst ituted an Indian version of “operation twist”.   37. I must reiterate here that it is not the pol icy of the Reserve Bank to resort to capital controls or reverse the direction of capital acco unt liberalization. Notably, the measures that we took did not restrict inflows or outflows by non-residents.           12\xa0\xa0II. Challenges for the Reserve Bank on the Way Forward  38. Now let me turn to the second part of my lect ure. Several times over th e last five years. I have often been asked about the challenges for the Reserve Bank on the wa y forward. As I finish my term as Governor of this great institution, this  is a question that has been playing repeatedly in my mind. I am deeply conscious that this is not a seminar, so I will highlight, but only briefly, four challenges that the Reserve Bank will need to address in order to remain a premiere policy institution.  Managing Policy in a Globalizing World 39. The first challenge on my list is for the Re serve Bank to learn to manage both economic and regulatory policies in a globalizing world. The global financial crisis, the eurozone sovereign debt crisis as well as the currency market volat ility over the last few m onths have emphatically demonstrated how external developments infl uence our domestic macroeconomic situation in complex, uncertain and even capricious ways. In making our policies, we have to factor in external developments, particularly the spillove r impact of the policies of advanced economies on our macroeconomy. This will become even more  important as India’s integration with the global economy increases. Surel y, globalization is a double edged sw ord. It comes with costs and benefits. The Reserve Bank needs to sharpen the analytical and intellectual rigour to make policies that exploit the advantages of globalization and mitigate its risks.  40. Over the last five years, as an instituti on, we have learnt quite a lot about managing policy in a globalizing world. Yet th e learning curve ahead is steep. My wish is that the Reserve Bank should take the lead in setting standards for how an emerging market central bank manages 13\xa0\xa0policies in a globalizing world. In other words, we should become the best practice that other central banks emulate.  Knowledge Institution 41. The second on my list of challenges is that  the Reserve Bank must position itself as a knowledge institution. The crisis has shown that  knowledge matters. Those central banks which are at the frontiers of domain knowledge and ar e pushing the envelope in terms of policies and actions will be better equipped to deal with the complexities of macroeconomic management in an increasingly dynamic and interconnected world.  42. There is obviously no template or manual for becoming a knowledge institution nor is there a comprehensive list of attributes. Be coming a knowledge institution is a continuous process of learning from the best practices in th e world, oftentimes reinve nting them to suit our home context, pushing the envelope, aski ng questions, being ope n minded, acting with professionalism and integrity and encouraging an instituti onal culture that  cuts through hierarchies. The Reserve Bank will also need to review its HR policies so as to build a talent endowment that can meet the challenges on the way forward.  Keep Your Ear Close to the Ground 43. When I was appointed Governor of the Re serve Bank in 2008, I went to call on the Prime Minister before I took ch arge. A man of few words as we al l know, he told me one thing that stuck in my mind: “Subbarao, you are moving from  long experience in the IAS into the Reserve Bank. In the Reserve Bank, one runs the risk of losing touch with the real world. With your mind space fully taken up by issues like interest ra tes, liquidity traps and monetary policy transmission, it is easy to forget that mone tary policy is also about reducing hunger and 14\xa0\xa0malnutrition, putting children in school, creating jobs, building roads and bridges and increasing the productivity of our farms and firms.  Keep your ear close to the ground.”   44. In the five years that I have been at the Reserve Bank, I have followed this wise counsel to the best of my ability. We have introduced a number of initiatives. The outreach programme of village visits by top executives of the Re serve Bank, village immersion programme for our younger officers, town hall shows and meetings with focus groups, conferences with frontline managers, conventions of business correspondents , to mention some of the important ones.   45. As a result of all these initi atives, the Reserve Bank is more  conscious today than before that the policies it makes have a meaning if, a nd only if, they make a positive difference to the real world. For example, one of the core concerns  of the Reserve Bank’s anti-inflationary stance is that inflation hurts, but hurts the poor much mo re than the better off. But the poor are not an organized, articulate lobby. As a public po licy institution, the Reserve Bank has the responsibility to make that extra effort to listen to the silent ‘v oice of the poor’.   46. Outreach is not a discrete task; it is a continuous  process.  As I said earlier, the policies of the Reserve Bank impact the everyday lives of people. The Reserve Bank will remain a useful and relevant institution only if it is able to un derstand the hopes and as pirations of ordinary people and factor them into  its policy calculus.   Autonomy and Accountability 47. The crisis over the last five years has re opened some fundamental questions about central banks - their mandates, the limits to their au tonomy and the mechanisms through which they render accountability. These questions are playi ng out in India too. Se veral committees have 15\xa0\xa0suggested that the mandate of the Reserve Ba nk should be narrowed on the argument that its currently broad mandate is diluting its focus on pr ice stability - the core concern of monetary policy. The Financial Sector Legislative Re forms Commission (FSLRC)  which submitted its report to the Government in March this year has argued that the mandate of the Reserve Bank should be restricted to moneta ry policy and regulation of banks and the payment system.   48. In the context of the mandate of central ba nks, one needs to keep in mind that the global financial crisis was a powerful rebuke to central  banks for neglecting fina ncial stability in the pursuit of price stability. In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, which saw the US Fed and other central banks provide liqui dity in spades and use unconven tional tools, a consensus had emerged that financial stability needed to be ex plicit in the objectives of monetary policy. Then the euro zone debt crisis forced the ECB to bend and stretch its mandate to bail out sovereigns, in essence implying that a central bank committed to  financial stability could not ignore sovereign debt sustainability. Pu t differently, the fundame ntalist view of a central bank with a single-minded objective (price stability), and a single instrument (short-term interest rate) is being reassessed across the world.  49. The jury is still out, but a consensus is building around the view that central banks now need to balance price stability, financial stability and sovereign debt sustaina bility. How this is to be achieved is the big question.  50. Clearly there are no easy answers. But there are certain tenets th at must inform the thinking over this issue. First, the fundamental responsibility of central banks for price stability should not be compromised. Second, central banks should have a lead, but not exclusive, responsibility for financial stability. Third, th e boundaries of central bank responsibility for 16\xa0\xa0sovereign debt sustainability should be clearly  defined. Fourth, in the matter of ensuring financial stability, the government must normally  leave the responsibility to the regulators, assuming an activist role only in times of crisis.   51. The crisis has made a strong case for a more expanded role for central banks. Do we ignore all that, and fall back on the old understanding of what a central bank should or should not do to change the RBI’s remit and scope of influenc e? That could turn out to be sub-optimal, even risky.  52. Related to all this is the question about the limits to the autonomy of the Reserve Bank and where and to what extent it should defer to  the executive. Finally, there are also questions about the accountability of the Reserve Bank for the outcomes of its policies.   53. As Governor of the Reserve Bank, I not only welcomed the debate on these issues, but even encouraged it, in the firm belief that such a de bate is in the larger public interest. At various times and in various contexts, I have responded to the issues in the debate. This is not the time and platform for extensive engagement on these i ssues. Here, I only want to  give my broad view.  54. Admittedly, the Reserve Bank has a mandate th at is wider than that of most central banks. This is an arrangement that has served  the economy well. There are synergies in the various components of the Reserve Bank’s mandat e and we should not fore feit those synergies. Surely, our institutional structures must adapt to the chan ging socioeconomic context, but any such change must be brought about only  after extensive debate and discussion.   17\xa0\xa055. Notably, in a full length feature on the Reserve Bank in 2012, The Economist  had said that the RBI is a role model for the kind of full service central bank that is back in fashion worldwide. There is something to that.  56. It is also important that the mandate of th e Reserve Bank is written into the statute, so that it is protected from the politic al dynamics of changing governments.  57. In the opening part of my lecture today, I expl ained the rationale for an autonomous central bank. Like in most other developi ng economies, the Reserve Bank was not born autonomous; it gained its autonomy over time as  a result of the lessons of international experience and the maturity of our political executive who saw th e benefits of preserving the autonomy of the Reserve Bank. On its part, the Reserve Bank earned this autonomy by staying committed to the pursuit of larger public interest.   58. Accountability is the flip side of autonomy. The Reserv e Bank of India Act does not prescribe any formal mechanis m for accountability. Over the years, however, certain good practices have evolved. Let me br iefly illustrate. We explain the rationale of our policies, and where possible indicate expected outcomes. Th e Governor holds a regular media conference after every quarterly policy revi ew which is an open house for que stions, not just related to monetary policy, but the en tire domain of activities of the Reserve Bank.   59. The Reserve Bank also services the Finance Minister in answering parliament questions relating to its domain. Most importantly, the Gove rnor appears before the Parliament’s Standing Committee on Finance whenever summoned, which happens on the average three to four times a year.  18\xa0\xa0 60. It has often struck me that for a public policy institution with such a powerful mandate, these mechanisms for accountability are both inadequate and unstructured. Perhaps, we should institute an arrangement whereby the Governor  goes before the Parliament Standing Committee on Finance twice a year to present a report on the Reserve Bank’s policies and outcomes and answers questions from the members of the Committ ee. In my view, this w ill not only secure the accountability structure but also protect the Reserve Bank from any potential assaults on its autonomy.  61. I have dwelt a bit longer on this last chal lenge of autonomy and accountability if only because we have not debated this in the larger public domain as much as we should have. And to the Reserve Bank staff, I want to say that they must be as zealous abou t rendering accountability as they are about guarding its au tonomy.   Thank God, the Reserve Bank Exists 62. A final thought on this issue of autonomy and accountability. There has been a lot of media coverage on policy differences between  the government and th e Reserve Bank. Gerard Schroeder, the former German Chancellor, on ce said, “I am often frustrated by the the Bundesbank. But thank God, it exists.” I do hope Finance Minister Chidambaram will one day say, “I am often frustrated by the Reserve Bank, so fr ustrated that I want to  go for a walk, even if I have to walk alone. But thank God, the Reserve Bank exists.”     19\xa0\xa0Conclusion 63. Let me now conclude. Over the course of this lecture, I have looked back to the last five years and indicated how that period divided into three different phases of complex policy challenges. I made an assessment of the Reserv e Bank’s policy response and addressed some of the criticism of that policy respons e at a broad level. Then, I looked ahead to four challenges that the Reserve Bank must address in order to remain a responsible, relevant a nd intellectually agile policy institution.   64. It has been an enormous privilege for me to  serve the Reserve Bank of India over the last five years. There were taxing times, testing tim es, anxious times. But at all times, I moved on with the confidence that there is  a great institution behind me that  will keep me in the right direction. I have been deeply impressed by the professionalism, intellectual agility and commitment of the staff and officers of the Rese rve Bank. This is an institution that has served the country with dignity and distinction and will continue to set exacting standards for professional integrity and work ethic.  Dharma 65. Nani Palkhivala said, “ Dharma  lives in the hearts of public men; when it dies, no constitution, no law, no amendmen t can save it.” If I can extend that thought a li ttle, a nation prospers only if its public institutions are guided by dharma . The Reserve Bank of  India tops the list of India’s public instit utions that are guided by Dharma  and Dharma  alone.  20\xa0\xa0', ' One Year in the Life of India\'s Monetary Policy Committee1  (Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India – Speech delivered at the Jaipur Regional Office of the RBI on October 27, 2017)    At 2.30 pm on October 4, 2017 the resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)  was released on the website of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and history was made in a small way. Exactly a  year ago, a page  was turned on a tradition that went back to the origins of the RBI in pre -independent India. The monetary policy decision, hitherto made solely by the Governor of the RBI, was ceded to a six -member committee  comprising the Governor as the Chairperson, the  Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy, one officer of the RBI appointed by its Central Board, and three external members appointed by the central government.  The room filled with debate and argumentation, challenge and counter- challenge, articulat ions of well -defended individualistic assessments, and voting  – India\'s monetary policy was undergoing  a regime change. Quietly ushered in, without any grandeur about it or anything like that, it was a big step towards the modernisation  of the conduct of monetary policy in India.   Invested by legislative mandate –  through an amendment to the RBI Act –  with the goal of \'maintaining price stability keeping in mind the objective of growth\', India   joined a select but growing band of countries that, beginning in 199 0, adopted flexible inflation targeting (FIT) as their framework for monetary policy. Under FIT , price stability is accorded primacy as an objective  of monetary policy, while being  mindful of the state of the economy. Accordingly, the target for inflation is to be achieved over a medium term horizon rather than at a point in time to mitigate any                                                   1 The theme of this lecture was inspired by an interview given by Governor Dr. Urjit  R. Patel in the Mint, October 9 , 2017 available at http://www.livemint.com/Industry/Gr9H0MnqAL5Ko4PdGa7fdL/RBI -governor -Urjit -Patel -Weve -started -seeing -the-upturn -in.html . I am grateful to Dr. Viral V. Acharya for valuable comments.  Inputs from Shri Sitikantha Pattanaik, Dr. Praggya Das , Dr. Rajiv Ranjan , Dr. Rajeev Jain and Dr. Jai Chander  are also acknowledged with appreciation. The usual disclaimers apply.    2 output effect s that disinflation could entail. Furthermore , the target itself is set within a band or range in acknowledgement of potentia l supply shocks that well up outside monetary policy’s realm. Accountability for failure to ensure the inflation band is generally defined , but after taking into account the various lags characterising the operation of monetary policy.    In India, the amended RBI Act defines the metric for the inflation target as the year-on-year change in the monthly consumer price index (CPI). T he numerical inflation target has been  set by the g overnment at four per cent, with an upper tolerance  level of 6 per ce nt and a lower tolerance  level of 2 per cent, internalis ing flexibility. The amended RBI Act has also specified accountability norms for dealing with failure to achieve the inflation target while building in recognition of the lags inherent in the conduct of monetary policy. It defines failure as average inflation breaching  the tolerance band for three consecutive quarters, not instantly. Although concerns about inflation had dominated monetary policy over the past decades in deference to a societal intolerance threshold, such an explicit commitment to a numerical inflation target as the centre -piece of policy had never been made.    It was veritably a baptism by fire for the MPC, the new kid on the block in a cross -country sense of the term. The amendment to  the RBI Act, the inflation target and tolerance band around it , and accountability with respect to failure to achieve the target were notified in the Gazette of India during May-August 2016 . They were widely telegraphed and occupied many media bytes. What  was little noticed , however, was that it was only on September 29, 2016 that  a press release of the Government of India (GoI) informed the world about the  appointment  of the MPC. Just one working day later, the MPC plunged into its work and on October 4, it issued its first resolution, unanimously backed. Many \'firsts\' surround that debut .  As the statutory semi -annual Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of October 2016 noted: “For  the first time in its history, the RBI has been provided the explicit legislative mandate to operate the monetary policy framework of the country. The primary objective of monetary policy has also been d efined for the first time.  The amendments also 3 provide for the constitution of a monetary policy committee that shall determine the policy rate required to achieve the inflation target, another landmark in India\'s monetary history."" Each of these milestones warrants a more detailed exposition to catch the inflexions around the turning point s. Indeed, each shall receive its due and enter the pantheon of legend s in my memoirs. In the interest of brevity and time, however, I shall devote the rest of my lecture to ( I) the initial conditions that brought to critical mass the urgency of the regime shift; ( II) the RBI\'s efforts to build t he institutional architecture  ahead of and to prepare the ground  for FIT; (III) the high wire that electrified the six decisions the MPC took in its formative year; and (IV) the conflicting pulls and trade -offs that shaped the decision of October 4, 2017 –  arguab ly, one of the most testing .   II. The Initial Conditions   Today, the Indian economy basks in macroeconomic stability with a configuration that could be the envy of peers:  a fiscal deficit steadfastly consolidatin g towards a Maastricht- like rendezvous  with a strong con sensus that its quality matters;  inflation below target , shepherded by an MPC committed to the centre of the band notified by government; a current account deficit below 1 per cent of GDP and sustainab le in terms of a dashboard of externa l sector indicators –  overall, a sweet spot by any consideration ! Yet, just four years ago, an ocean of vulnerability engulfed the economy. The situation around the “taper tantrum” seemed so d ire that even a growth rate of 6.6  per cent and foreign exchange  reserves of close to US $ 3 00 billion seemed like matchsticks before a tide that swept India into the infamous \'fragile five\' in that fateful summer of 2013 . In a fundamental way, it was those troubled conditions that provided the impetus for monetary pol icy regime change.  India was among the first nations to rebound from the  global financial crisis , with tailwinds from a fiscal stimulus, the RBI’s policy rate cut cumulatively by 425 basis points and access to potential liquidity from the Reserve Bank expanded to as high as 10 per cent of GDP with a view to keeping financial institutions functional as 4 financial market s seized up . In 2009, g rowth seemed set to accelerate to the aspirational double digits that Indians dream about. Long embarrassed by the parlous state of the physical infrastructure, we set out to build world clas s roads, airports, power supply and ports. T he financial sector w as expected to take a lead role in creating conducive conditions for this big push even, as we have learned painfully, at the risk of much loss of governance and risk control .  There was , however, a  serpent in the garden ! Starting out innocuously in the gu ise of food prices rising on the back of a monsoon failure, inflation reared its ugly head, hidden behind the heady upswing of growth that deceptively appeared  too good to interrupt. The wholesale price index  (WPI), the official metric for measuring inflat ion then, failed to detect it initially –  although the WPI food index rose by c lose to 15 per cent in 2009, headline inflation measured as the year- on-year change in the WPI remained below 4 per cent . It was beguilingly pulled down by the core measure of those days –  WPI non- food manufactured products inflation was close to zero! By contrast, inflation in terms of the consumer price index  for industrial workers (CPI -IW) was raging at above 12 per cent. Spreadi ng incipiently, food inflation became generalised by 2010 -11. The WPI picked it up by then, and spillovers to prices of non-food manufactured products started getting manifested. By the time there was a policy reaction in March 201 0, it was too late. Over the period 2009 -12, inflation averaged 10.4 per cent  measured by  the CPI- IW and 7.4 per cent by the WPI. Thirteen policy rate increases failed to excoriate it . Entrenched now in the system, it began to mutate like a multi- headed Hydra .   Inflation is not j ust the rate of increase  of the price level. It is also considered an index of the quality of governance  and macroeconomic management by the  state which seeks to assure the well -being of its people who have relinquished to it some control over their lives for the greater common good. Indian society is well -known for zero tolerance for double digit inflation. Often in the not too distant past, it has been a  pivotal election  issue and governments have been voted out of office over the price of the lowly onion. In the year 2009 itself, inflation expectations of households a year 5 ahead rose by 400 basis points. By the end of the year, they crossed 12 per cent and kept climbing, entrenched in th ose high reaches. People were completely discounting the possibility of putting the genie back into the bottle. This time around, however, they did not take recourse to the ballot. They did something more sinister –  they bought gold!   As inflation outcomes and expectations climbed, the real rate of return on bank deposits started to get eroded and even turned negative. Saving in financial assets became a losing proposition. So people pulled out their money from bank deposits and other finan cial assets and put it into gold. For India, buying gold is just another conduit of capital flight; only 2 per cent of India\'s gold demand is mined domestically. Since 2012, India was already the largest consumer of gold. In the troubled years (2009 -12), a n annual average of 700 -800 tonnes of gold imports surged to cross 1000 tonnes. With gold constituting 11 per cent of total imports, the current account deficit began to expand and by the third quarter of 2012 -13, it reached  6.8 per cent of GDP – a time bo mb ticking away, waiting to explode. Indeed, the RBI warned of the danger posed by the burgeoning current account deficit in its monetary policy statements of 2011 -12 and 2012 -13, but with the intoxicating surges of capital inflows of that time, these warn ings went unheeded.   In hindsight, it was a crisis waiting for i gnition . That was provided in May 2013  when the Fed eral Reserve (Fed) hinted at the possibility of normalising monetary policy later in the year. Financial markets were rudely jolted out of th e complacency that the Fed’s quantitative e asing (QE)  had spread  since 2009 . Foreign capital started  frantically herding at exits  out of  emerging market economies (EMEs) to  scramble  for safe haven. Currencies, yields  and equities were roiled as investors fled out of EMEs  – perceived as risky asset classes – and contagion claimed one economy after another. In particular, they lost faith in five emerging economies  – Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, South Africa , and India. The ep ithet – the “fragile five ” – entered the lexicon of financial markets. 6  Inflation had perniciously attacked the Indian economy in more ways than one. What started out as a dose of food inflation had eventually morphed into a balance of payments crisis. Mon etary policy was subjected to its most severe challenge –  the evaporation of credibility. The time for reform had arrived unannounced and was demanding immediate attention.   III. Building the Institutional Framework   The immediate response of the g overnment and the RBI was to arrest the deterioration in the external accounts. Buffering up the reserves, restricting gold imports, tightening domestic liquidity t o push up market interest rates –  much has been written about the 2013 defence of the econom y, and visceral memories of that  turmoil  remain. But, it was a time for soul searching  – something rather basic was broke and needed to be fixed. The pledge of good governance and macroeconomic management to the people had taken a body blow and had to be r e-built. Early on , it was clear that a fundamental change was due, something that would shake up the system and unsettle the ruling orthodoxy, something that would require an amendment to the RBI Act. Accordingly, starting in 2014, the RBI embarked upon bu ilding stone by stone –  though not necessarily in chronological order –  the institutional pl inth for a new monetary policy framework.  In September 2013 , an Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework  was set up . The Expert Committee\'s recommendations provided the intellectual edifice on which the new framework would rest. It was an internally consistent model, complete in itself, ranging from the goal(s) of monetary policy; the instrument rule that would guide th e policy maker’ s pursuit of the goal; the operating procedure; the transmission; and the international dimensions of monetary policy. It drew heavily on work accumulated before it and broke new ground as well.   7 The consumer price index , the official metric  for gauging inflation , struck a chord with households and consumers  by capturing price changes at the retail level , unlike the WPI which is closer to a producer price index or at least , it reflects  wholesale price changes and t ells households about inflat ion measured before it reache s them. Moreover, the WPI was until January 2012 a weekly index comprising 676 items. Price relatives were not always available or collected and often they were just repeated2. All this w as easier said than done . The public had  for long been used to the RBI articulating inflation concerns in terms of the WPI under a multiple indicator based monetary policy framework . In January 2015 , a new all India consumer price index had been constructed with 2012 as its base. The problem for the RBI was, however, that it had never reacted to CPI inflation before. Consequently, the responsiveness of CPI inflation to policy impulses was unknown. There was no way to calibrate policy actions. The anointment of headline CPI inflation as  the offici al measure of inflation was a brave move in another significant aspect -  almost half of the CPI basket was food! The Indian economy has had a long history of being buffeted  by food shocks which exhibit persistence and spillovers. Supply shocks cannot be wi thin the remit of monetary policy. The RBI took the view that although the first incidence of a food shock is  outside the purview of monetary policy, second round effects such as on inflation expectations and especially, spillovers impacting the rest of in flation  are! It also judged that headline CPI inflation is more easily communicated than an exclusion measure stripped of its most salient components.  The RBI set out a glide path for bringing down inflation from its peak of 11.5 per cent in November 2013  towards more conscionable levels , abjuring a big bang in order to minimise output losses of disinflation. Within this path, it set up self- imposed targets – 8 per cent by the end of 2014; 6 per cent by end -2015 and 5 per cent by end -2016. These targets we re achieved  with a large measure of good luck (the collapse of international commodity price s in 2014; geometric averaging in the new CPI ) but                                                  2 The WPI has a low weight for food items, which i s not in sync with consumption patterns  of households.  It does not includes services.  Price relatives are drawn from a mix of markets, but primarily from bulk sale markets where ordinary consumer do not shop.  8 perhaps fortune  favour s the brave! This was the backdrop against which t he MPC set about its work. It was destined to co nfront a growth -inflation balance on the razor’s edge over the year ahead amid st heightened uncertainty.    IV. The Year Gone By   The first year of the MPC’s functioning would be a tumultuous one in more ways than one. After several false starts, global demand and trade secured a tenuous foothold in the second half of 2016 and gained traction through the first half of 2017. Financial markets were churned by political events , though . In November 2016, the US presidential elections stampeded capital flows out of  EMEs and a surge of the US dollar triggered siz eable depreciations in currencies around the world. Again in January 2017, the ‘Brexit’ roadmap and expectations of fiscal expansionism by the new US administration propelled the US dollar to a multi -year high. As 2017 progressed, reflation trade lifted equ ity markets, hardened bond yields and returned capital flows to emerging markets. The US dollar’s bull  run lost steam by mid -March ; in fact, it weakened right through early September,  while EME currencies traded with an appreciating bias. By late September, however, there was a complete reversal. The US dollar clawed back lost ground with the announcement of Fed balance sheet normalisation  and tensions around North Korea. Capital outflows from EME equity markets gathered pace. For India, an improvement in e xternal sector viability occurred despite these global developments. Generally buoyant capital inflows buffered up the foreign exchange reserves.   What would challenge the MPC throughout the year was the  domestic dilemma –  the trade -off between inflation and growth was set to become sharp and the tension between the two so acute  that it would eventually impact the voting pattern of the MPC . Shortly, I am going to focus exclusively on the trials and tribulations facing the MPC in this crucial balancing act;  for a moment, however, let me introspect on the RBI.    9 At the time of the MPC’s first meeting a year ago, the RBI itself was caught up in the throes of leadership change –  the twenty -fourth Governor had just assumed office ; the Deputy Governor responsible  for monetary policy had not yet been appointed , and the senior- most Deputy Governor had to step in to complete the six -member MPC. Also, the RBI had been working with the convivial guidance of a technical advisory committee since 2005. The more formal pro cesses associated with an MPC had to be literally tailored from the cross -country experience to adapt to the country -specifics. What emerged was quite a unique sequence of institutional procedures informed heavily by internal management information systems .  As the MPC set about its first meeting, the accommodative cycle of monetary policy in India that commenced in January 2015 was maturing , with the policy rate having been reduced by a cumulative 150 basis points  already . Yet, the ground underneath was moving. Macroeconomic and liquidity conditions were about to undergo tectonic shifts. The combination of a stronger than usual seasonal spike in vegetable prices, highly elevated pulses prices and international crude prices  firming up from a recent trough , veered inflation up from its projected path during April -July 2016, even as growth slowed. In the August CPI reading – which was the first print that became available to the MPC –  a glimpse of the forming vortex was reveal ed. With a suddenness that overturned the April -July surge, inflation fell off a cliff as the prices of vegetables and pulses sank into deflation!   In these challenging circumstances, the MPC prognosticated inflation developments as “…a downward shift in t he momentum of food inflation –  which holds the key to future inflation outcomes… .” This assessment would turn out to be prophetic! On the hope that the satisfactory monsoon and cautious business optimism would quicken growth in the window of opportunity t hat the lull in inflation opened up, the MPC voted unanimously for a reduction of 25 basis points in the policy rate . This took the cumulative rate reduction to 175 basis points in this phase of easing . In this meeting, the MPC maintain ed an accommodative policy stance.  10 Just a month later, demonetisation  – which involved withdrawal of about 87  per cent of the outstanding stock of currency from circulation , setting off a sudden liquidity explosion in the system –  altered monetary conditions drastically. Ove r the next few months, the pangs of currency exchange preoccupied the nation, but when the definitive history of that time is documented, the RBI’s valiant defence of financial stability , right  from the morning after,  will hopefully receive its due. As the  withdrawn currency notes were returned by the public, deposits flooded into banks and swamped them with idle reserves. A wall of liquidity started moving through financial markets, threatening to take down everything in its path –  interest rates; yields; exchange rates; asset prices. Standing alone between the ocean of liquidity and financial chaos, the RBI mounted an extraordinary liquidity absorption strategy. It combined unconventional instruments with regular operations when the liquidity tsunami was s o overwhelming that it could have completely depleted the RBI’s stock of government securities that are used as collateral in reverse repo auctions. In order to tide over the delay in obtaining market stabilisation scheme securities from the government, th e incremental cash reserve ratio (ICRR) was deployed and for the first time in the RBI’s history, an ICRR of the size of 100 per cent of the relevant demand and time liabilities of banks was applied.   These austere conditions weighed ponderously upon the MPC\'s meetings in December 2016, February  and April 2017. Ab initio , the MPC recognised that its assessment of underlying conditions will likely be clouded by demonetisation effects that were unfolding in the form of transient disruption of cash -intensive segments of the economy, an abrupt compression of demand, restrained discretionary spending and fire sales of perishables that would reduce inflation temporarily. Accordingly, it decided – unanimously again –  to look through these \'transitory but unclear e ffects\' that were influencing the outlook disproportionately. It kept the policy rate unchanged  through these meetings , but noting that inflation excluding food and fuel was  setting a floor to headline inflation by exhibiting downward  inflexibility . The MP C also worried that global financial market spillovers could impact macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets . Accordingly , it changed the policy stance from 11 accommodative to neutral in its February meeting. Importantly, the MPC renewed its commitment t o the inflation target of 4 per cent. In keeping with this stance, the RBI refined its liquidity management framework in its April meeting, inter alia  narrowing the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) corridor to +/ -25 basis points (from +/ -50 basis points  earlier)  to ensure a finer alignment of the weighted average call money rate, the operating target of monetary policy, with the policy rate.   Three features distinguish these meetings of the MPC. First, it was assailed by the criticism of large one -sided inflation forecast errors right up to the June inflation print, which turned out to be a historic low. Demonetisation was readily available to denou nce. Yet, the collapse in inflation occurred from August  2016 , well before demonetisation , which  could have accentuated it transitorily  during November 2016-January 2017. The cumulative deviation of 80 basis points between actual inflation and forecasts be tween August 2016 and June 2017 was entirely due to th e twin deflation  of vegetable and pulses prices that produced a trend shift, holding a mirror to serious errors in food management which would later ignite wide -spread farmers’ unrest. In this context, the MPR of October 2017 stated:  “These developments may warrant a reappraisal of the scope and quality of food management strategies that seem prone to failure in the face of shocks in either direction. In the past too, supply shocks, of which large one -sided deviations of inflation from projections are merely a symptom, drove disinflation episodes.” In the rush to pillory the scapegoat, attention was diverted from the real issues and consequently, from the right fixes.  Second, there was an overwhelming p reference to wait out the transitory effects of demonetisation. Although today , it appears the logical decision to take, markets were taken by surprise  by the neutral stance and sentiment turned bearish. At the cost of a hawkish tone, the MPC was striving to anchor expectations in a situation when even the near- term was a step in the dark. Third, the decisions of the MPC in these meetings were taken by unanimity, although driven by individualistic approaches. The MPR of April 2017 surveyed the recent countr y experience and found many decisions  taken by unanimity. Where differences were revealed, they were typically confined to 12 the size of the change in the policy rate rather than contesting the overarching policy stance.  The June and August meetings of the MPC were different from the three that preceded them, being literally on the horns of the growth -inflation dilemma. Although inflation had firmed up a bit in February and March, its abrupt and significant retreat in April caused the MPC to lower the forecast path of inflation for 2017 -18 from 4.5 per cent in H1 and 5 per cent in H2 to 2 -3.5 per cent in H1 and 3.5 -4.5 pe r cent in H2 in its June meeting. It unambiguously pointed out that “prices of pulses are clearly reeling under the impact of a supply glut caused by record output and imports. Policy interventions, including access to open trade, may be envisaged to arres t the slump in prices.” Abundant supply, coupled with the renege on procurement by designated agencies, resulted in the market price of pulses falling sharply below minimum support prices fixed by the government. Nonetheless, the MPC did express misgivings  about the durability of the unusually low momentum of inflation, the likelihood of petrol and diesel prices rising , and the possibility that the stickiness of inflation excluding food and fuel would re -assert itself soon. It also indicated that the transi tory effects of demonetisation have ‘lingered on in price formations’ and warned that ‘premature action at this stage risks disruptive policy reversals later and the loss of credibility.’ Importantly, the MPC prognosis of economic activity also reflected i ts concern about a deeper than initially anticipated loss of momentum . It underscored the urgency around reviving private investment, restoring banking sector health and removing infrastructural bottlenecks all of which were outside the purview of monetary  policy but would greatly enhance its effectiveness. For the first time, the MPC voted to keep the policy rate unchanged not by unanimity but by a five -member majority, as the scars left by falling growth and inflation set up conflicting pulls.  In the August meeting, the MPC saw for the first time the impact of the implementation of the house rent allowance (HRA) for central government employees for which it had been preparing the public for some time, especially the need to distinguish between ‘statistical’ and second round effects. The former would merely 13 push up the index without actual inflation, while the latter would warrant careful monitoring for evidence of generali sation. The MPC observed that some upside risks to inflation had reduced –  inflation excluding the HRA impact would likely be only a little above 4 per cent by Q4; inflation excluding food and fuel ha d fallen significantly over the past three months –  but underlying growth imp ulses in industry and services were weakening, given c orporate deleveraging and the retrenchment of investment demand. In fact, growth projections for 2016 -17 and 2017- 18 had been revised down by a cumulative 70 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively (in its October 2017 meeting, the MPC would revise it down even further, as I will shortly bring out , and the cumulative downward adjustment would be 70 basis points for each year).  Seizing the space that had opened up for some accommodation, the MPC decided to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis poin ts but with a neutral stance . In order to derive the maximum effects of the rate cut, it reiterated the  urgent need to revive private investment, remove infrastructure bottlenecks, resolve stress in corporate balance sheets and recapitalise public sector b anks to help restart credit flows. This time around, the vote was carried by a four- member majority , and the divergence in voting preference was two -sided – one member voted  for status quo while another voted for a rate cut by 50 bps.    V. The Fourth Bi -Monthly Monetary Policy, 2017 -18 The monetary policy statement o f October 2017  was framed in quite a dramatic setting. Even as growth broadened globally, it slowed below 6 per cent for the second quarter in a row in India in April -June. At this rate, India was  still among the fastest growing large economies of the world, but the blow from the growth print  was significant enough to set off a chorus of alarm.   The slowdown was essentially located in manufacturing activity which slumped to a 20-quarter low. Over the recent few years, industrial output  has shown synchronicity across geographies, with trade being identified as the channel of co -movement. In th e early part of 2017 -18, however, Indian industry has been an outlier, decelerating just when industrial production the world over is on the mend. Transient disruptions 14 associated with the GST rollout are likely operating as a drag. Nonetheless, it is fair to say that the nation is impatient to see a revival in industry, especially as capital formation stag ed a modest recovery.   Sharpening the dilemma for the MPC, retail inflation rose nearly  200 basis points since its last meeting. The upturn was broad -based, provoking households to expect that the general level of prices would increase by more than the current rate in the months ahead. Input costs facing both farms and firms rose, but weak pricing power in conditions of subdued demand prevented a fuller- blown pass -through into retail inflation.   In the MPC’s assessment, inflation will likely rise from current levels in the rest of the year, with farm loan waivers and the implementations of pay and allowance revisions by states a la  the centre  posing upside risks. The MPC also pensively expressed concern about the spectres of geopolitical tensions and imminent normalisation of systemic central bank balance sheets that loomed over the outlook. On food inflation, the MPC’s prognosis was more sang uine though, with adequate foodstocks and supply management efforts seen as mitigating factors.   On growth, the MPC regarded  the first estimates of kharif  production – which were lower than last year’s level and the target for this year –  and the GST roll out as early but transitory setbacks. It believe d that agricultural activity will improve from here on. Furthermore, it found b usiness optimism expressed by firms about prospects for the October -December quarter reassuring. Relative to its August assessmen t, the MPC lowered its growth forecast by 60 basis points which, in a rough and ready sense, measures the net lagged impact of shocks such as demoneti sation and the GST.    The MPC expressed the view that recent structural reforms would support growth over the medium -term. Accordingly, it expected upsides to the growth forecast from the resolution of GST -related impediments and from the pay and allowance revision 15 for state government employees, while the hardening of input costs and the loss of consumer confidence would balance the risks.   The MPC was particularly candid in drawing out the bottom line: “…it is imperative to reinvigorate investment activity.” For this, creation of a conducive environment for investment is critical, involving adequate recapitali sation of stressed banks, closing the infrastructure gap, simplifying the GST, hastening clearances and rationalis ing procedures  by states relating to investment proposals.  Against this backdrop of its appraisal of the evolution of macroeconomic  and financial conditions, the MPC decided to hold the policy rate unchanged and to maintain a neutral policy stance. In the reactions that followed, there seemed a central tendency that the MPC may have called right.   V. Concluding Remarks    I hope my thoughts on the recent monetary policy engagement have provided some clarity on the challenges confronting the MPC and the rationale underlying its decision s. Monetary policy is ultimately the art or science of the feasible. Ben Bernanke, when he was chairma n of the Federal Reserve Board, was once asked by Liaquat Ahmed , the author of the celebrated book Lords of Finance , as to how confident he was that the theory of quantitative easing or QE would work. His reply –  “The problem with QE is it works in practic e but it doesn\'t work in theory"" – provoked laughter, but it  is so true of monetary policy more generally. Monetary policy decision making is always complex and severely testing. It is typically undertaken in an explosion of diverse views, each differing from the other in expressing intensity and fervour. The endeavour of  our MPC has been to try to share with the public through its r esolution s and through individual minutes a set of balanced assessments so  that monetary policy in India becomes transparent and predictable. Looking ahead, the task of the MPC is cut out and I can do no better than quote Governor Dr. Patel from his recent interview: “we should aim at achieving the inflation target without losing sight of supporting economic growth.”  ', ' One Year in the Life of India\'s Monetary Policy Committee1  (Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India – Speech delivered at the Jaipur Regional Office of the RBI on October 27, 2017)    At 2.30 pm on October 4, 2017 the resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)  was released on the website of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and history was made in a small way. Exactly a  year ago, a page  was turned on a tradition that went back to the origins of the RBI in pre -independent India. The monetary policy decision, hitherto made solely by the Governor of the RBI, was ceded to a six -member committee  comprising the Governor as the Chairperson, the  Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy, one officer of the RBI appointed by its Central Board, and three external members appointed by the central government.  The room filled with debate and argumentation, challenge and counter- challenge, articulat ions of well -defended individualistic assessments, and voting  – India\'s monetary policy was undergoing  a regime change. Quietly ushered in, without any grandeur about it or anything like that, it was a big step towards the modernisation  of the conduct of monetary policy in India.   Invested by legislative mandate –  through an amendment to the RBI Act –  with the goal of \'maintaining price stability keeping in mind the objective of growth\', India   joined a select but growing band of countries that, beginning in 199 0, adopted flexible inflation targeting (FIT) as their framework for monetary policy. Under FIT , price stability is accorded primacy as an objective  of monetary policy, while being  mindful of the state of the economy. Accordingly, the target for inflation is to be achieved over a medium term horizon rather than at a point in time to mitigate any                                                   1 The theme of this lecture was inspired by an interview given by Governor Dr. Urjit  R. Patel in the Mint, October 9 , 2017 available at http://www.livemint.com/Industry/Gr9H0MnqAL5Ko4PdGa7fdL/RBI -governor -Urjit -Patel -Weve -started -seeing -the-upturn -in.html . I am grateful to Dr. Viral V. Acharya for valuable comments.  Inputs from Shri Sitikantha Pattanaik, Dr. Praggya Das , Dr. Rajiv Ranjan , Dr. Rajeev Jain and Dr. Jai Chander  are also acknowledged with appreciation. The usual disclaimers apply.    2 output effect s that disinflation could entail. Furthermore , the target itself is set within a band or range in acknowledgement of potentia l supply shocks that well up outside monetary policy’s realm. Accountability for failure to ensure the inflation band is generally defined , but after taking into account the various lags characterising the operation of monetary policy.    In India, the amended RBI Act defines the metric for the inflation target as the year-on-year change in the monthly consumer price index (CPI). T he numerical inflation target has been  set by the g overnment at four per cent, with an upper tolerance  level of 6 per ce nt and a lower tolerance  level of 2 per cent, internalis ing flexibility. The amended RBI Act has also specified accountability norms for dealing with failure to achieve the inflation target while building in recognition of the lags inherent in the conduct of monetary policy. It defines failure as average inflation breaching  the tolerance band for three consecutive quarters, not instantly. Although concerns about inflation had dominated monetary policy over the past decades in deference to a societal intolerance threshold, such an explicit commitment to a numerical inflation target as the centre -piece of policy had never been made.    It was veritably a baptism by fire for the MPC, the new kid on the block in a cross -country sense of the term. The amendment to  the RBI Act, the inflation target and tolerance band around it , and accountability with respect to failure to achieve the target were notified in the Gazette of India during May-August 2016 . They were widely telegraphed and occupied many media bytes. What  was little noticed , however, was that it was only on September 29, 2016 that  a press release of the Government of India (GoI) informed the world about the  appointment  of the MPC. Just one working day later, the MPC plunged into its work and on October 4, it issued its first resolution, unanimously backed. Many \'firsts\' surround that debut .  As the statutory semi -annual Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of October 2016 noted: “For  the first time in its history, the RBI has been provided the explicit legislative mandate to operate the monetary policy framework of the country. The primary objective of monetary policy has also been d efined for the first time.  The amendments also 3 provide for the constitution of a monetary policy committee that shall determine the policy rate required to achieve the inflation target, another landmark in India\'s monetary history."" Each of these milestones warrants a more detailed exposition to catch the inflexions around the turning point s. Indeed, each shall receive its due and enter the pantheon of legend s in my memoirs. In the interest of brevity and time, however, I shall devote the rest of my lecture to ( I) the initial conditions that brought to critical mass the urgency of the regime shift; ( II) the RBI\'s efforts to build t he institutional architecture  ahead of and to prepare the ground  for FIT; (III) the high wire that electrified the six decisions the MPC took in its formative year; and (IV) the conflicting pulls and trade -offs that shaped the decision of October 4, 2017 –  arguab ly, one of the most testing .   II. The Initial Conditions   Today, the Indian economy basks in macroeconomic stability with a configuration that could be the envy of peers:  a fiscal deficit steadfastly consolidatin g towards a Maastricht- like rendezvous  with a strong con sensus that its quality matters;  inflation below target , shepherded by an MPC committed to the centre of the band notified by government; a current account deficit below 1 per cent of GDP and sustainab le in terms of a dashboard of externa l sector indicators –  overall, a sweet spot by any consideration ! Yet, just four years ago, an ocean of vulnerability engulfed the economy. The situation around the “taper tantrum” seemed so d ire that even a growth rate of 6.6  per cent and foreign exchange  reserves of close to US $ 3 00 billion seemed like matchsticks before a tide that swept India into the infamous \'fragile five\' in that fateful summer of 2013 . In a fundamental way, it was those troubled conditions that provided the impetus for monetary pol icy regime change.  India was among the first nations to rebound from the  global financial crisis , with tailwinds from a fiscal stimulus, the RBI’s policy rate cut cumulatively by 425 basis points and access to potential liquidity from the Reserve Bank expanded to as high as 10 per cent of GDP with a view to keeping financial institutions functional as 4 financial market s seized up . In 2009, g rowth seemed set to accelerate to the aspirational double digits that Indians dream about. Long embarrassed by the parlous state of the physical infrastructure, we set out to build world clas s roads, airports, power supply and ports. T he financial sector w as expected to take a lead role in creating conducive conditions for this big push even, as we have learned painfully, at the risk of much loss of governance and risk control .  There was , however, a  serpent in the garden ! Starting out innocuously in the gu ise of food prices rising on the back of a monsoon failure, inflation reared its ugly head, hidden behind the heady upswing of growth that deceptively appeared  too good to interrupt. The wholesale price index  (WPI), the official metric for measuring inflat ion then, failed to detect it initially –  although the WPI food index rose by c lose to 15 per cent in 2009, headline inflation measured as the year- on-year change in the WPI remained below 4 per cent . It was beguilingly pulled down by the core measure of those days –  WPI non- food manufactured products inflation was close to zero! By contrast, inflation in terms of the consumer price index  for industrial workers (CPI -IW) was raging at above 12 per cent. Spreadi ng incipiently, food inflation became generalised by 2010 -11. The WPI picked it up by then, and spillovers to prices of non-food manufactured products started getting manifested. By the time there was a policy reaction in March 201 0, it was too late. Over the period 2009 -12, inflation averaged 10.4 per cent  measured by  the CPI- IW and 7.4 per cent by the WPI. Thirteen policy rate increases failed to excoriate it . Entrenched now in the system, it began to mutate like a multi- headed Hydra .   Inflation is not j ust the rate of increase  of the price level. It is also considered an index of the quality of governance  and macroeconomic management by the  state which seeks to assure the well -being of its people who have relinquished to it some control over their lives for the greater common good. Indian society is well -known for zero tolerance for double digit inflation. Often in the not too distant past, it has been a  pivotal election  issue and governments have been voted out of office over the price of the lowly onion. In the year 2009 itself, inflation expectations of households a year 5 ahead rose by 400 basis points. By the end of the year, they crossed 12 per cent and kept climbing, entrenched in th ose high reaches. People were completely discounting the possibility of putting the genie back into the bottle. This time around, however, they did not take recourse to the ballot. They did something more sinister –  they bought gold!   As inflation outcomes and expectations climbed, the real rate of return on bank deposits started to get eroded and even turned negative. Saving in financial assets became a losing proposition. So people pulled out their money from bank deposits and other finan cial assets and put it into gold. For India, buying gold is just another conduit of capital flight; only 2 per cent of India\'s gold demand is mined domestically. Since 2012, India was already the largest consumer of gold. In the troubled years (2009 -12), a n annual average of 700 -800 tonnes of gold imports surged to cross 1000 tonnes. With gold constituting 11 per cent of total imports, the current account deficit began to expand and by the third quarter of 2012 -13, it reached  6.8 per cent of GDP – a time bo mb ticking away, waiting to explode. Indeed, the RBI warned of the danger posed by the burgeoning current account deficit in its monetary policy statements of 2011 -12 and 2012 -13, but with the intoxicating surges of capital inflows of that time, these warn ings went unheeded.   In hindsight, it was a crisis waiting for i gnition . That was provided in May 2013  when the Fed eral Reserve (Fed) hinted at the possibility of normalising monetary policy later in the year. Financial markets were rudely jolted out of th e complacency that the Fed’s quantitative e asing (QE)  had spread  since 2009 . Foreign capital started  frantically herding at exits  out of  emerging market economies (EMEs) to  scramble  for safe haven. Currencies, yields  and equities were roiled as investors fled out of EMEs  – perceived as risky asset classes – and contagion claimed one economy after another. In particular, they lost faith in five emerging economies  – Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, South Africa , and India. The ep ithet – the “fragile five ” – entered the lexicon of financial markets. 6  Inflation had perniciously attacked the Indian economy in more ways than one. What started out as a dose of food inflation had eventually morphed into a balance of payments crisis. Mon etary policy was subjected to its most severe challenge –  the evaporation of credibility. The time for reform had arrived unannounced and was demanding immediate attention.   III. Building the Institutional Framework   The immediate response of the g overnment and the RBI was to arrest the deterioration in the external accounts. Buffering up the reserves, restricting gold imports, tightening domestic liquidity t o push up market interest rates –  much has been written about the 2013 defence of the econom y, and visceral memories of that  turmoil  remain. But, it was a time for soul searching  – something rather basic was broke and needed to be fixed. The pledge of good governance and macroeconomic management to the people had taken a body blow and had to be r e-built. Early on , it was clear that a fundamental change was due, something that would shake up the system and unsettle the ruling orthodoxy, something that would require an amendment to the RBI Act. Accordingly, starting in 2014, the RBI embarked upon bu ilding stone by stone –  though not necessarily in chronological order –  the institutional pl inth for a new monetary policy framework.  In September 2013 , an Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework  was set up . The Expert Committee\'s recommendations provided the intellectual edifice on which the new framework would rest. It was an internally consistent model, complete in itself, ranging from the goal(s) of monetary policy; the instrument rule that would guide th e policy maker’ s pursuit of the goal; the operating procedure; the transmission; and the international dimensions of monetary policy. It drew heavily on work accumulated before it and broke new ground as well.   7 The consumer price index , the official metric  for gauging inflation , struck a chord with households and consumers  by capturing price changes at the retail level , unlike the WPI which is closer to a producer price index or at least , it reflects  wholesale price changes and t ells households about inflat ion measured before it reache s them. Moreover, the WPI was until January 2012 a weekly index comprising 676 items. Price relatives were not always available or collected and often they were just repeated2. All this w as easier said than done . The public had  for long been used to the RBI articulating inflation concerns in terms of the WPI under a multiple indicator based monetary policy framework . In January 2015 , a new all India consumer price index had been constructed with 2012 as its base. The problem for the RBI was, however, that it had never reacted to CPI inflation before. Consequently, the responsiveness of CPI inflation to policy impulses was unknown. There was no way to calibrate policy actions. The anointment of headline CPI inflation as  the offici al measure of inflation was a brave move in another significant aspect -  almost half of the CPI basket was food! The Indian economy has had a long history of being buffeted  by food shocks which exhibit persistence and spillovers. Supply shocks cannot be wi thin the remit of monetary policy. The RBI took the view that although the first incidence of a food shock is  outside the purview of monetary policy, second round effects such as on inflation expectations and especially, spillovers impacting the rest of in flation  are! It also judged that headline CPI inflation is more easily communicated than an exclusion measure stripped of its most salient components.  The RBI set out a glide path for bringing down inflation from its peak of 11.5 per cent in November 2013  towards more conscionable levels , abjuring a big bang in order to minimise output losses of disinflation. Within this path, it set up self- imposed targets – 8 per cent by the end of 2014; 6 per cent by end -2015 and 5 per cent by end -2016. These targets we re achieved  with a large measure of good luck (the collapse of international commodity price s in 2014; geometric averaging in the new CPI ) but                                                  2 The WPI has a low weight for food items, which i s not in sync with consumption patterns  of households.  It does not includes services.  Price relatives are drawn from a mix of markets, but primarily from bulk sale markets where ordinary consumer do not shop.  8 perhaps fortune  favour s the brave! This was the backdrop against which t he MPC set about its work. It was destined to co nfront a growth -inflation balance on the razor’s edge over the year ahead amid st heightened uncertainty.    IV. The Year Gone By   The first year of the MPC’s functioning would be a tumultuous one in more ways than one. After several false starts, global demand and trade secured a tenuous foothold in the second half of 2016 and gained traction through the first half of 2017. Financial markets were churned by political events , though . In November 2016, the US presidential elections stampeded capital flows out of  EMEs and a surge of the US dollar triggered siz eable depreciations in currencies around the world. Again in January 2017, the ‘Brexit’ roadmap and expectations of fiscal expansionism by the new US administration propelled the US dollar to a multi -year high. As 2017 progressed, reflation trade lifted equ ity markets, hardened bond yields and returned capital flows to emerging markets. The US dollar’s bull  run lost steam by mid -March ; in fact, it weakened right through early September,  while EME currencies traded with an appreciating bias. By late September, however, there was a complete reversal. The US dollar clawed back lost ground with the announcement of Fed balance sheet normalisation  and tensions around North Korea. Capital outflows from EME equity markets gathered pace. For India, an improvement in e xternal sector viability occurred despite these global developments. Generally buoyant capital inflows buffered up the foreign exchange reserves.   What would challenge the MPC throughout the year was the  domestic dilemma –  the trade -off between inflation and growth was set to become sharp and the tension between the two so acute  that it would eventually impact the voting pattern of the MPC . Shortly, I am going to focus exclusively on the trials and tribulations facing the MPC in this crucial balancing act;  for a moment, however, let me introspect on the RBI.    9 At the time of the MPC’s first meeting a year ago, the RBI itself was caught up in the throes of leadership change –  the twenty -fourth Governor had just assumed office ; the Deputy Governor responsible  for monetary policy had not yet been appointed , and the senior- most Deputy Governor had to step in to complete the six -member MPC. Also, the RBI had been working with the convivial guidance of a technical advisory committee since 2005. The more formal pro cesses associated with an MPC had to be literally tailored from the cross -country experience to adapt to the country -specifics. What emerged was quite a unique sequence of institutional procedures informed heavily by internal management information systems .  As the MPC set about its first meeting, the accommodative cycle of monetary policy in India that commenced in January 2015 was maturing , with the policy rate having been reduced by a cumulative 150 basis points  already . Yet, the ground underneath was moving. Macroeconomic and liquidity conditions were about to undergo tectonic shifts. The combination of a stronger than usual seasonal spike in vegetable prices, highly elevated pulses prices and international crude prices  firming up from a recent trough , veered inflation up from its projected path during April -July 2016, even as growth slowed. In the August CPI reading – which was the first print that became available to the MPC –  a glimpse of the forming vortex was reveal ed. With a suddenness that overturned the April -July surge, inflation fell off a cliff as the prices of vegetables and pulses sank into deflation!   In these challenging circumstances, the MPC prognosticated inflation developments as “…a downward shift in t he momentum of food inflation –  which holds the key to future inflation outcomes… .” This assessment would turn out to be prophetic! On the hope that the satisfactory monsoon and cautious business optimism would quicken growth in the window of opportunity t hat the lull in inflation opened up, the MPC voted unanimously for a reduction of 25 basis points in the policy rate . This took the cumulative rate reduction to 175 basis points in this phase of easing . In this meeting, the MPC maintain ed an accommodative policy stance.  10 Just a month later, demonetisation  – which involved withdrawal of about 87  per cent of the outstanding stock of currency from circulation , setting off a sudden liquidity explosion in the system –  altered monetary conditions drastically. Ove r the next few months, the pangs of currency exchange preoccupied the nation, but when the definitive history of that time is documented, the RBI’s valiant defence of financial stability , right  from the morning after,  will hopefully receive its due. As the  withdrawn currency notes were returned by the public, deposits flooded into banks and swamped them with idle reserves. A wall of liquidity started moving through financial markets, threatening to take down everything in its path –  interest rates; yields; exchange rates; asset prices. Standing alone between the ocean of liquidity and financial chaos, the RBI mounted an extraordinary liquidity absorption strategy. It combined unconventional instruments with regular operations when the liquidity tsunami was s o overwhelming that it could have completely depleted the RBI’s stock of government securities that are used as collateral in reverse repo auctions. In order to tide over the delay in obtaining market stabilisation scheme securities from the government, th e incremental cash reserve ratio (ICRR) was deployed and for the first time in the RBI’s history, an ICRR of the size of 100 per cent of the relevant demand and time liabilities of banks was applied.   These austere conditions weighed ponderously upon the MPC\'s meetings in December 2016, February  and April 2017. Ab initio , the MPC recognised that its assessment of underlying conditions will likely be clouded by demonetisation effects that were unfolding in the form of transient disruption of cash -intensive segments of the economy, an abrupt compression of demand, restrained discretionary spending and fire sales of perishables that would reduce inflation temporarily. Accordingly, it decided – unanimously again –  to look through these \'transitory but unclear e ffects\' that were influencing the outlook disproportionately. It kept the policy rate unchanged  through these meetings , but noting that inflation excluding food and fuel was  setting a floor to headline inflation by exhibiting downward  inflexibility . The MP C also worried that global financial market spillovers could impact macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets . Accordingly , it changed the policy stance from 11 accommodative to neutral in its February meeting. Importantly, the MPC renewed its commitment t o the inflation target of 4 per cent. In keeping with this stance, the RBI refined its liquidity management framework in its April meeting, inter alia  narrowing the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) corridor to +/ -25 basis points (from +/ -50 basis points  earlier)  to ensure a finer alignment of the weighted average call money rate, the operating target of monetary policy, with the policy rate.   Three features distinguish these meetings of the MPC. First, it was assailed by the criticism of large one -sided inflation forecast errors right up to the June inflation print, which turned out to be a historic low. Demonetisation was readily available to denou nce. Yet, the collapse in inflation occurred from August  2016 , well before demonetisation , which  could have accentuated it transitorily  during November 2016-January 2017. The cumulative deviation of 80 basis points between actual inflation and forecasts be tween August 2016 and June 2017 was entirely due to th e twin deflation  of vegetable and pulses prices that produced a trend shift, holding a mirror to serious errors in food management which would later ignite wide -spread farmers’ unrest. In this context, the MPR of October 2017 stated:  “These developments may warrant a reappraisal of the scope and quality of food management strategies that seem prone to failure in the face of shocks in either direction. In the past too, supply shocks, of which large one -sided deviations of inflation from projections are merely a symptom, drove disinflation episodes.” In the rush to pillory the scapegoat, attention was diverted from the real issues and consequently, from the right fixes.  Second, there was an overwhelming p reference to wait out the transitory effects of demonetisation. Although today , it appears the logical decision to take, markets were taken by surprise  by the neutral stance and sentiment turned bearish. At the cost of a hawkish tone, the MPC was striving to anchor expectations in a situation when even the near- term was a step in the dark. Third, the decisions of the MPC in these meetings were taken by unanimity, although driven by individualistic approaches. The MPR of April 2017 surveyed the recent countr y experience and found many decisions  taken by unanimity. Where differences were revealed, they were typically confined to 12 the size of the change in the policy rate rather than contesting the overarching policy stance.  The June and August meetings of the MPC were different from the three that preceded them, being literally on the horns of the growth -inflation dilemma. Although inflation had firmed up a bit in February and March, its abrupt and significant retreat in April caused the MPC to lower the forecast path of inflation for 2017 -18 from 4.5 per cent in H1 and 5 per cent in H2 to 2 -3.5 per cent in H1 and 3.5 -4.5 pe r cent in H2 in its June meeting. It unambiguously pointed out that “prices of pulses are clearly reeling under the impact of a supply glut caused by record output and imports. Policy interventions, including access to open trade, may be envisaged to arres t the slump in prices.” Abundant supply, coupled with the renege on procurement by designated agencies, resulted in the market price of pulses falling sharply below minimum support prices fixed by the government. Nonetheless, the MPC did express misgivings  about the durability of the unusually low momentum of inflation, the likelihood of petrol and diesel prices rising , and the possibility that the stickiness of inflation excluding food and fuel would re -assert itself soon. It also indicated that the transi tory effects of demonetisation have ‘lingered on in price formations’ and warned that ‘premature action at this stage risks disruptive policy reversals later and the loss of credibility.’ Importantly, the MPC prognosis of economic activity also reflected i ts concern about a deeper than initially anticipated loss of momentum . It underscored the urgency around reviving private investment, restoring banking sector health and removing infrastructural bottlenecks all of which were outside the purview of monetary  policy but would greatly enhance its effectiveness. For the first time, the MPC voted to keep the policy rate unchanged not by unanimity but by a five -member majority, as the scars left by falling growth and inflation set up conflicting pulls.  In the August meeting, the MPC saw for the first time the impact of the implementation of the house rent allowance (HRA) for central government employees for which it had been preparing the public for some time, especially the need to distinguish between ‘statistical’ and second round effects. The former would merely 13 push up the index without actual inflation, while the latter would warrant careful monitoring for evidence of generali sation. The MPC observed that some upside risks to inflation had reduced –  inflation excluding the HRA impact would likely be only a little above 4 per cent by Q4; inflation excluding food and fuel ha d fallen significantly over the past three months –  but underlying growth imp ulses in industry and services were weakening, given c orporate deleveraging and the retrenchment of investment demand. In fact, growth projections for 2016 -17 and 2017- 18 had been revised down by a cumulative 70 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively (in its October 2017 meeting, the MPC would revise it down even further, as I will shortly bring out , and the cumulative downward adjustment would be 70 basis points for each year).  Seizing the space that had opened up for some accommodation, the MPC decided to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis poin ts but with a neutral stance . In order to derive the maximum effects of the rate cut, it reiterated the  urgent need to revive private investment, remove infrastructure bottlenecks, resolve stress in corporate balance sheets and recapitalise public sector b anks to help restart credit flows. This time around, the vote was carried by a four- member majority , and the divergence in voting preference was two -sided – one member voted  for status quo while another voted for a rate cut by 50 bps.    V. The Fourth Bi -Monthly Monetary Policy, 2017 -18 The monetary policy statement o f October 2017  was framed in quite a dramatic setting. Even as growth broadened globally, it slowed below 6 per cent for the second quarter in a row in India in April -June. At this rate, India was  still among the fastest growing large economies of the world, but the blow from the growth print  was significant enough to set off a chorus of alarm.   The slowdown was essentially located in manufacturing activity which slumped to a 20-quarter low. Over the recent few years, industrial output  has shown synchronicity across geographies, with trade being identified as the channel of co -movement. In th e early part of 2017 -18, however, Indian industry has been an outlier, decelerating just when industrial production the world over is on the mend. Transient disruptions 14 associated with the GST rollout are likely operating as a drag. Nonetheless, it is fair to say that the nation is impatient to see a revival in industry, especially as capital formation stag ed a modest recovery.   Sharpening the dilemma for the MPC, retail inflation rose nearly  200 basis points since its last meeting. The upturn was broad -based, provoking households to expect that the general level of prices would increase by more than the current rate in the months ahead. Input costs facing both farms and firms rose, but weak pricing power in conditions of subdued demand prevented a fuller- blown pass -through into retail inflation.   In the MPC’s assessment, inflation will likely rise from current levels in the rest of the year, with farm loan waivers and the implementations of pay and allowance revisions by states a la  the centre  posing upside risks. The MPC also pensively expressed concern about the spectres of geopolitical tensions and imminent normalisation of systemic central bank balance sheets that loomed over the outlook. On food inflation, the MPC’s prognosis was more sang uine though, with adequate foodstocks and supply management efforts seen as mitigating factors.   On growth, the MPC regarded  the first estimates of kharif  production – which were lower than last year’s level and the target for this year –  and the GST roll out as early but transitory setbacks. It believe d that agricultural activity will improve from here on. Furthermore, it found b usiness optimism expressed by firms about prospects for the October -December quarter reassuring. Relative to its August assessmen t, the MPC lowered its growth forecast by 60 basis points which, in a rough and ready sense, measures the net lagged impact of shocks such as demoneti sation and the GST.    The MPC expressed the view that recent structural reforms would support growth over the medium -term. Accordingly, it expected upsides to the growth forecast from the resolution of GST -related impediments and from the pay and allowance revision 15 for state government employees, while the hardening of input costs and the loss of consumer confidence would balance the risks.   The MPC was particularly candid in drawing out the bottom line: “…it is imperative to reinvigorate investment activity.” For this, creation of a conducive environment for investment is critical, involving adequate recapitali sation of stressed banks, closing the infrastructure gap, simplifying the GST, hastening clearances and rationalis ing procedures  by states relating to investment proposals.  Against this backdrop of its appraisal of the evolution of macroeconomic  and financial conditions, the MPC decided to hold the policy rate unchanged and to maintain a neutral policy stance. In the reactions that followed, there seemed a central tendency that the MPC may have called right.   V. Concluding Remarks    I hope my thoughts on the recent monetary policy engagement have provided some clarity on the challenges confronting the MPC and the rationale underlying its decision s. Monetary policy is ultimately the art or science of the feasible. Ben Bernanke, when he was chairma n of the Federal Reserve Board, was once asked by Liaquat Ahmed , the author of the celebrated book Lords of Finance , as to how confident he was that the theory of quantitative easing or QE would work. His reply –  “The problem with QE is it works in practic e but it doesn\'t work in theory"" – provoked laughter, but it  is so true of monetary policy more generally. Monetary policy decision making is always complex and severely testing. It is typically undertaken in an explosion of diverse views, each differing from the other in expressing intensity and fervour. The endeavour of  our MPC has been to try to share with the public through its r esolution s and through individual minutes a set of balanced assessments so  that monetary policy in India becomes transparent and predictable. Looking ahead, the task of the MPC is cut out and I can do no better than quote Governor Dr. Patel from his recent interview: “we should aim at achieving the inflation target without losing sight of supporting economic growth.”  ']"

My presentation will initially provide a broad overview of the global developments and then move on to briefly list the aspects of market and regulatory failures which characterised the recent developments. I will then lay down the broad contours of the financial sector policies in India,  with the details of a few specific initiatives relevant to financial stability. The concluding remarks will be in the nature of a few broad issues for further debate.   I. Global Financial Markets Recent Developments While the trigger for the global developments in the financial markets during the recent past was the rising default rates on sub-prime mortgages in the US, the source of the problem was perhaps not the macro-global imbalances but significant mispricing of risks in the financial system. Easy monetary pol icy in major financial centres, globalisation of liquidity flows, wide-spread use of highly complex structured debt instruments and the inadequacy of banking supervision in coping with financial innovations, contributed to the severity of the crisis. The persistent under pricing of risks was suspected by several central banks for quite some time, but it was felt by many that these risks were widely dispersed through financial innovation and that they would not pose any serious problems to the banking system. When the sub-prime crisis  did occur, however, it triggered a wide contagion affecting many of the large global financial institutions. Banks, in particular, appear to have ceased to trust each other’s creditworthiness leading to difficulties in the money markets in the US, Europe and the UK resulting in drying up of liquidity, since each financial institution attempted to shore up its own liquidity to meet its obligations. The problems of maturity mismatch in the c onduits or structured investment vehicles (SIVs) created by the banks for purposes of securitisation manifested themselves in a                                              1  Address by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India, at the Meeting of the Task Force on Financial Markets Regulation organized by the Initiative for Policy Dialogue at Manchester, United Kingdom, on July 1, 2008.  2sudden spurt in demand for liquidity from banks to meet their liquidity support obligations to the SIVs or to fund the assets of the SIVs that were taken on to their balance sheets. It is now realised that the relevant banks have leveraged excessively and had not fully recognised the risks or had seriously underpriced them, thus warranting large capital infusion. Uncertainty about the possible losses yet to be disclosed by several of them has not yet ceased.   These developments have brought forward several new realities that pose severe challenges to macro-economic management, in particular to monetary and regulatory policies globally. First, concerns relating to the US slowdown and its intensity have mounted in view of the potential spill over on to the global economy. Second, threats to the global economy are emanating from advanc ed economies in sharp contrast to earlier crises which stemmed from the emerging wo rld. Third, there are indications that protectionist tendencies have increased around the world in anticipation of the growing possibilities of slower growth in advanced economies. Fourth, linkages between financial sector developments and the real sector have become more worrisome than before, with apprehensions that financial turmoil may spill over to the real sector with adverse implications for employment and growth. With tightening in lending standards, deterioration in asset quality and deceleration in consumer loan demand, there are indications that events in the financial markets are beginning to have a persisting impact on the real economy as well. Fifth, higher and more volatile prices of food, energy and other commodities have compounded the problem , causing a significant upside bias to inflation and inflation expectations across the world, complicating the conduct of monetary policy at a time of severe financial stress. Further, while rising energy prices may be an exogenous shock for several countries, for the global economy as a whole it is endogenous. Sixth, terms-of-trade losses due to soaring commodity prices not only reduce the capacity of a re-balancing of the world economy but also impact several countries in different ways but essentially in an adverse fashion. In fact, it is possible that new global economic imbalances are emerging on account of large movements in commodity prices, especially oil. Sevent h, Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) are exhibiting resilience until now in the face of t he global financial turmoil reflecting relatively stronger macroeconomic framework and sustainable macroeconomic balances. However, until how long and to what extent it will persist is uncertain. On the other hand, inflationary pressures appear to be common to mature economies and EMEs but the latter are under greater stress.    3The central banks in major countries have had to take recourse, in appropriate mix, to three instruments to avoid serious spill-over of these issues in money or credit markets into the wider economy: (i) adjustment of interest rates for borrowing and lending; (ii) money market operations designed to inject special liquidity in order to avoid a break-down in payment systems among banks, and (iii) to put in mechanisms for financial transactions among the largest of the financial intermediaries which automatically impact the second and third rung intermediaries. Central banks in major industrialised economies, by and large, responded with injection of liquidity for a longer period than is usually done; they also resorted to dilution in the quality of collateral required for liquidity support. Most of these operations have not been conducted at the penal rates expected in such situations. This is an unprecedented package which, some observers believe, is indicative of the seriousness of the underlying problems. In addition, there were some specific-institution oriented operations, namely, in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. While there have been inflationary pressures in most economies, the USA has been faced with a th reat of serious slowdown in growth warranting a series of cuts in policy rates in recent months.  In recent weeks, concerns over inflationary pressures globally have taken the centre-stage even while there are no indications as to whether threats to financial stability have been fully resolved and whether persistent threats of recession in USA have abated. Consequently, the policy dilemmas have become more acute at the current juncture. The most urgent and short-term priority for central bankers at the current juncture seems to be to calm the nerves about inflation or to anc hor inflation expectations, with an implicit recognition that a somewhat elevated headline inflation in the short-term may be difficult to avoid. Further, high inflation rates when acco mpanied by higher variability of inflation, raises greater uncertainties. These acute policy dilemmas at the current juncture between growth and inflation have to be faced in the background of financial turbulence which is yet to calm down. There are also calls for fundamental re-think on macro-economic, monetary and financial sector policies to meet  the new challenges and realities, which perhaps represent a structural shift in the international financial architecture demanding potentially enhanced degree of coordination among monetary authorities and regulators. A review of the policies relating to financial regulation, in a way, needs to address both the acute policy dilemmas in the short run and a fundamental re-think on broader frameworks of financial and economic policies over the medium-term.     4Market Failures What are some of the identifiable sources of market failures that led to the current financial turbulence?  First, the prolonged benign macroeconomic conditions gave rise to complacency among many market participants and led to an erosion of sound practices, resulting in adoption of poor credit risk appraisal standards.  Second, some of the standard risk management tools and models used by market participants were not equipped to estimate th e potential impact of adverse events for structured credit products and high uncerta inty around model estimates that largely missed the underlying combination of risks. Fu rther, these risk models, generally tended to induce the market participants to adopt a unidirectional approach.  Third, many investors, including institutional ones, with the capacity to undertake their own credit analysis, did not undertake sufficient in-house examination of the risks in the assets underlying structured investments.  Fourth , the role of credit rating agencies (CRAs) in the recent market developments has attracted attention.  Fifth, the distortions in incentive structures can be seen from various perspectives namely  incentives for originators, arranger s, distributors and managers in the originate-to-distribute model; the compensation schemes in financial institutions not distinguishing between realised and unrealised profits; encouraging financial structures tailored to obtaining high ratings etc. Sixth, weaknesses in public disclosures by financial institutions on the type and magnitude of risks associated with their on- and off-balance sheet exposures are noticeable.   Seventh, large commercial banks and investment banks have assumed increasingly similar risk profiles, use sim ilar models to assess and are subject to the same risk-management challenges under the given circumstances.  Eighth, there is a new dimension to bank liquidity, with the shifting emphasis to a market based wholesale or purchased liabilities. This makes banks increasingly dependent on the market for raising liquidity, while markets may have a tendency to shy away from providing liquidity  when they are most needed.   Regulatory Shortcomings While the foregoing brings out the failures of the markets and of the market participants, some of the regulatory shor tcomings identified are as follows.    5First, the regulators recognised some of  the underlying vulnerabilities in the financial sector but failed to take effective action, partly because they may have overestimated the strength and resilience of the financial system or they assumed that the risks were well distributed among entities outside the banking system. Many analysts and policymakers had raised concerns about ex cessive risk taking, loose underwriting standards, and asset overvaluations, all of which have in the absence of timely effective actions laid the seeds for crises.  Second, the limitations in regulatory ar rangements, including the capital adequacy framework, contributed to the growth of unregulated exposures, excessive risk-taking and weak liquidity risk management.  Third, weaknesses in the application of accounting standards and the shortcomings associated with the valuati on and financial reporting of structured products played a significant role in the current tur bulence through pro-cyclical valuations and lack of full disclosure of banks’ true risk profile through the cycle.  Fourth, the crisis revealed the need to adapt some of the tools and practices of central banks to manage system liquidity in the light of banks’ cross-border operations. The recent experiences have highlighted the differences in emergency liquidity frameworks of central banks, on aspects such as range of collateral, range of eligible counterparties; and the differences in central bank practices.  Fifth, supervisors did not adequately address deterioration in risk management standards in the regulated entities, which did not fully reckon the risks associated with new financial instruments, and there were s hortcomings in consolidated supervision.  Sixth, deficiencies in crisis management and bank resolution frameworks, including deposit insurance,  have been observed, especially where central banks do not have a central supervisory role.  Seventh, the complex inter-relationship between regulation, the inappropriate accounting practices, and regulators’ excessive dependence on external ratings may have exacerbated the market turbulence.   Menu of Solutions The above underlying factors clearly demonstrate a need to enhance the resilience of the global system and consider some of the prescriptions that have been proffered for the consideration of the policy makers. The recent developments in the global financial markets have been closely followed by many. These include market  6participants, central bankers, supervisors, multilateral institutions, political leaders, analysts, academicians, and also the layman. With so much attention being focused on the ongoing turbulence, by so many stakeholders, we have a wide menu of solutions and prescriptions. I will quickly run-through some of these.  First, risk management framew orks including the gover nance arrangements in banks and financial institutions need to be reviewed by the managements in the light of the recent experiences.  Second, supervisors need to play a more active role in scrutinizing the risk management practices, including stress testing and governance arrangements, off balance sheet entities and structured products.. At the same time, it is crucial to recognize that risk management cannot be achieved solely by regulation.  Consolidated supervision and prudential reporting should be applied to off balance sheet entities associated with financial institutions and to loans sold with implicit or explicit recourse. There is a need to review the prudential norms linked to external ratings assigned by the CRAs.  Third, supervisors should encourage institutions to develop more robust models which use more prudent and reliable assumptions and stress testing methodologies; and monitor more closely the internal processes, and controls for managing risk.  Fourth, there is a need to rationalise the regulatory and supervisory prescriptions with a view to reducing the scope for arbitraging.  This also calls for closer coordination of the relevant supervisors/ supervisory arms.  Fifth, it is necessary to correct the imbalances in the incentive mechanisms at various levels.  Sixth, greater transparency is not only necessary to make the markets more efficient and to optimise the allocation of capital, but it is also considered to be the best insurance policy against irrational herd behaviour and unjustified contagion in times of stress.  Seventh, there is a need to collectively review and resolve the element of pro-cyclicality in prudential regulations, accounting rules, and the attitude of the authorities that tend to apply these.  Eighth, it is necessary for the CRAs to improve their governance and rating methodologies.   7Ninth, arguably it is useful to re-visit the relevant accounting standards and explore the scope for applying fair value accounting through the cycle so as to mitigate pro-cyclicality.  Tenth, supervisors should have clear authority to intervene at the first sign of weakness, preferably much before the institution’s net worth turns negative.  Finally, deposit insurance systems should aim to limit the likelihood of retail depositor runs in troubled banks through adequate coverage, and have the capacity to pay depositors quickly.  II. Indian Experience Ensuring Financial Stability In contrast to the above global scenario, India has by-and-large been spared of global financial contagion due to the sub-prime turmoil for a variety of reasons. The credit derivatives market is in an embryonic stage; t he originate-to-distribute model in India is not comparable to the ones prevailing in advanced markets; there are restrictions on investments by resident in such products issued abroad; and regulatory guidelines on securitisation do not permit immediate profit  recognition. Financial stability in India has been achieved through perseverance of prudential policies which prevent institutions from excessive risk taking, and financial market s from becoming extremely volatile and turbulent. As a result, while there are orderly conditions in financial markets, the financial institutions, especially banks, reflect strength and resilience. While supervision is exercised by a quasi-independent Board carved out of the RBI Board, the interface between regulation and supervision is close in respect of banks and financial institutions, and on market regulation, a close coordination with other regulators exists. Let me recount this experience which, in some ways, reflects a policy that aimed to assure financial stability while maintaining growth momentum at reasonable levels and giving a high priority to price stability. Investment Portfolio In the year 2000 the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) conducted a stress test of the banks’ investment portfolio in an increasing interest rate scenario, when the general trend then was decreasing interest rates. At that time, banks in India were maintaining a surrogate capital charge for market risk, which was at a variance from the Basel norms. On the basis of the findings, in order to equip the banking system to be better positioned to meet the adverse impact of interest rate risk, banks were advised in January 2002 to build up an Investment Fluctuation Reserve (IFR) within a period of five years. The prudential target for the IFR was 5 per cent of their investments in ‘Held for Trading’  8(HFT) and ‘Available for Sale’ (AFS) categories. Banks were encouraged to build up a higher percentage of IFR up to 10 per cent of their AFS and HFT investments. This counter-cyclical prudential requirement enabled banks to absorb some of the adverse impact when interest rates began moving in the opposite direction in late 2004. Banks have been maintaining capital charge for market risk as envisaged under the Basel norms since end-March 2006. The regulatory guidelines in India require banks to classify their investments in three categories, similar to the international standards. The investments included in the Held to Maturity (HTM) category was capped at 25 per cent of the total investments and banks are allowed to carry the investments in the HTM category at cost, subject amortisation of premium, if any. With the change in the direction of the movement of interest rates in 2004, the cap on the HTM category was reviewed in the light of the statutory prescriptions (referred to as statut ory liquidity ratio (SLR) in India) requiring banks to mandatorily invest up to 25 per cent of their Demand and Time Liabilities (DTL) in eligible government securities. In view of the statutory pre-emption and the long duration of the government securities, banks were permitted to exceed the limit of 25 per cent of total investments under Held to Ma turity (HTM) category provided the excess comprised only of the SLR securities, and the total SLR securities held in the HTM category was not more than 25 per cent of their DTL. Such shifting was allowed at acquisition cost or book value or market val ue on the date of transfer, whichever is the least, and the depreciation, if any, on such transfer was required to be fully provided for. The above transition is consistent with inte rnational standards that do not place any cap on HTM category, and was considered advisable taking into account the statutory nature of the SLR while ensuring prudence and transparency in valuation on transfer to HTM category. While the earlier prescription for this  category was relatively more conservative, the changes in September 2004 recognised the dynamic interface with the interest rate cycles and were counter-cyclical.  Capital Adequacy – Risk Weights In view of the increase in growth of advances to the real estate sector, banks were advised to put in place a proper risk management system to contain the risks involved. Banks were also advised to put in place a system for ensuring proper checking and documentation of related papers before sanctioning / disbursing of such loans. In June 2005, the RBI advised banks to have a board mandated policy in respect of their real estate exposure covering exposure limits, collaterals to be considered, margins to be kept, sanctioning authority/level and sector to be financed. In view of the rapid increase in loans to the real estate sector raising concerns about asset quality and the potential  9systemic risks posed by such exposure, the risk weight on banks' exposure to commercial real estate was increased from 100 per cent to 125 per cent in July 2005 and further to 150 per cent in April 2006. The risk weights on housing loans extended by banks to individuals against mortgage of housing properties and investments in mortgage backed securities (MBS) of housing fi nance companies (HFCs), recognised and supervised by National Housing Bank (NHB) we re increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent in December 2004. However, on a review, banks were advised to reduce the risk weight in respect of exposures arising out of housing loans up to Rs.30 lakh (USD 75,000 approx) to individuals against the mortgage of residential housing properties from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, in view of the lower perception of risks in these exposures.  In the light of the strong growth of consumer credit and the volatility in the capital markets, it was felt that the quality of lending could suffer during the phase of rapid expansion. Hence, as a counter cyclical measure, we increased the risk weight for consumer credit and capital market exposur es from 100 per cent to 125 per cent. Provisions against Standard Assets The prudential norms relating to income recognition, asset classification and provisioning, introduced during 1992-93 are bei ng continuously monitored and refined to bring them on par with international best prac tices. In keeping with this, several measures were initiated in 2005-06. The provisions for standard assets were revised progressively in November 2005, May 2006 and January 2007, in stages in view of t he continued high credit growth in the real estate sector, pers onal loans, credit card receivables, and loans and advances qualifying as capital market exposure and a higher default rate with regard to personal loans and credit card receivables, which emerged as a matter of concern. The standard assets in the following categories of loans and advances attract a two per cent provisioning requirement (i) personal loans (including credit card receivables); (ii) loans and advances qualifying as capital market expo sure; (iii) real estate loans (excluding residential housing loans), and (iv) loans and advances to systemically important non-deposit accepting non-banking finance compani es (NBFC-ND-SI). In order to ensure continued and adequate availability of credit to the highly productive sectors of the economy, the provisioning requirement for al l other loans and advances, classified as standard assets was kept unchanged, viz., (i) direct advances to the agricultural and SME sectors at 0.25 per cent; and (ii) all other loans and advances at 0.4 per cent.      10Exposure to Inter-Bank Liability In order to reduce the extent of concentration of bank’s liabilities the RBI had issued guidelines to banks in March 2007 placing prudential limits on the extent of their Inter-Bank Liability (IBL) as a proportion of their networth (200%). Those banks which had a higher capital adequacy ratio of 125% of the regulatory minimum were allowed a higher limit of 300% of networth. In addition, prudential limits have also been placed on the extent to which banks may access the inter-bank call money market both as a lender and as a borrower.   Financial Regulation of Systemically Important NBFCs and Banks’ Relationship with Them The RBI has been strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework for non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) since 1997 with the objective of making the NBFC sector vibrant and healthy. The focus was initially on deposit-taking NBFCs. These efforts were pursued further during 2006-07, when a major thrust was on strengthening the regulatory framework with regard to systemically important non-banking financial companies so as to reduce the regulatory gaps. At that time, the regulatory focus was also widened to include systemically important non-deposit taking NBFCs and prudential norms were specified for these entities.  The application of different levels of regulations to the activities of banks and NBFCs, and even among different categories of NBFCs, had given rise to some issues relating to uneven coverage of regulations. Based on the recommendations of an Internal Group and taking into consideration the feedback received thereon, a revised framework to add ress the issues pertaining to the overall regulation of systemically important NB FCs and the relationship between banks and NBFCs was put in place in December 2006.  Securitisation guidelines The RBI has issued guidelines on securitisation of standard assets in February 2006. The guidelines are applicable to banks and financial institutions, including non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). These guidelines provide for a conservative treatment of securitisation exposures for capital adequacy purposes, especially in regard to the credit enhancement and liquidity facilities. The regulatory framework encourages greater participation by third parties with a view to ensure better governance in the structuring of special purpose vehicles (SPVs), the products, and the provision of support facilities. A unique feature of these guidelines, which may be at a variance with the accounting standards, is that any profits on sale of assets to the SPV are not allowed to be recognised immediately on sale but over the life of the pass through certificates issued  11by the SPV. We believe that these guidelines, as a package, have ensured an appropriate incentive mechanism for securitisation transactions.  Banks’ Investment in Non-SLR Securities RBI had emphasised that banks should obs erve prudence in order to contain the risk arising out of their non-SLR (i.e., non government) investment portfolio, in particular through the private placement route. Detailed prudential guidelines on the subject were issued in June 2001, which were reviewed and revised in November 2003. These guidelines, inter alia, address aspects of coverage, regulatory requirements, listing and rating requirements, fixing of prudential limits , internal assessments, role of Boards, disclosures, and trading and settlement in debt securities. Banks were specifically advised that they should not be solely guided by the ratings assigned to these securities by the external rating agencies but that they should do a detailed appraisal as in the case of direct lending.  Marking-to-market The Indian accounting standards are generally aligned to the International Financial Reporting Standards, though there are some differences. In India, we are yet to fully adopt the marking-to-market requirements as available in the international standards. The Indian standards are relatively conservative and do not permit recognition of unrealised gains in the profit and loss account or equity, though unrealised losses are required to be accounted. Banks are required to  mark-to-market the investments in the Held for Trading (HFT) and Available for Sale (AFS) categories at periodical intervals, on a portfolio basis, and provide for the net losses and ignore the net gains. This has proved to be a stabilising factor, inasmuch as it has not induced an imbalance in the incentive structures and has also proved to be less pro-cyclical.   Moral Suasion and Supervisory Review Moral suasion and public articulation of concerns has helped in achieving a desired re-balancing of suspected excesses in risk-taking among banks. Some of the areas where moral suasion has been used are the need for banks to monitor unhedged foreign currency exposures of their corporate clients, adoption of appropriate incentive mechanisms by banks for encouraging disclosures of derivative exposures by their corporate clients, banks’ reliance on non-deposit resources to finance assets, their excessive reliance on wholesale deposits and uncomfortable loan-to-value (LTV) ratios in respect of housing loans etc.   12A supervisory review process (SRP) was initiated with select banks having significant exposure to sensitive sectors, including reliance on call money market, in order to ensure that effective risk mitigants and sound internal control systems are in place. In the first round, a framework was developed for monitoring the systemically important individual banks. The second round of SRP was directed to analyse banks’ exposure to sensitive sectors and identify outliers. Based on the analyses of these outlier banks, guidelines were issued to all banks indicating the need for better risk management systems in banks at operating levels.  In brief, in India the  focus is on regulatory comfort, going beyond regulatory compliance. In a choice between emphasis of  regulations on saving capital and protecting depositors’ interests or reinforcing financial system stability, the latter have always prevailed.  III. Indian Experience of Financial Sector Liberalisation and Development  It is necessary to clarify that while t he measures mentioned above are aimed at fostering financial stability, in order to enhance efficiency several other initiatives have been taken to liberalise the macro-policy environment in which banks operate through a re-orientation of regulatory prescriptions by replacing micro regulations with macro-prudential regulations, providing an enabling envi ronment for universal banking, improved corporate governance in private sector banks, and enabling consolidation of banks in the private sector. Some other important m easures that promoted a vibrant and robust operating environment and framework for the banking system that promoted growth and business opportunities include a reduction in pre-emption through reserve requirements; shift to market determined pricing for government securities; disbanding of some of the administered interest rates; auction-based r epos-reverse repos for short-term liquidity management; facilitation of improved payment s and settlement mechanism; setting up of the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) to act as central counter party for facilitating payments and settlement system relating to fixed income securities, money market instruments and foreign exchange transactions; setting up of INFINET as the communication backbone for the financial sector; introduction of Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) for screen-based trading in gove rnment securities; introduction of Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System; debt recovery tribunals, asset reconstruction companies, settlement advisory committees, corporate debt restructuring mechanism, etc. for quicker recovery/ restructuring of stressed assets; promulgation of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest  13(SARFAESI) Act, 2002 and its subsequent amendment to ensure creditor rights; setting up of Credit Information Bureau of India Limited (CIBIL) for information sharing on defaulters as also other borrowers. These gr owth oriented initiatives have appropriately complemented the stability oriented initiatives.  Development Orientation In the context of the rapidly evolving financial landscape, the RBI has also been suitably reorienting its regulatory and supervisory framework to meet the needs of the common man. It has also been the endeavour of the RBI to improve credit delivery and customer service by banks. The RBI has simultaneously focussed on financial inclusion and extension of banking services to the unbanked areas of the economy. The guidelines on lending to the priority sector included improv ement of credit delivery to those sectors of the economy that impact large segment of the population, the weaker section and to the sectors which are employment-intensive such as agriculture and tiny and small enterprises. In order to improve credi t delivery to micro and small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), the RBI has urged banks to review their institutional arrangements for delivering credit to the SME sector, especially in identified clusters in various parts of the country, and to take measures to strengthen the expertise in and systems at branches located in or near such identified clusters with a view to providing adequate and timely credit. The RBI has taken several measures in recent years aimed at providing customer service at reasonable cost. These measures include enhancing customer protection and disclosures, code of ethics and grievance redressal, among others. The RBI’s broad approach to financial inclusion aims at ‘c onnecting people’ with the banking system and not just credit dispensation; giving people access to the payments system; and portraying financial inclusion as a viable business model and opportunity. The RBI has been initiating measures to improve the outreach of banks and their services, and promote financial inclusion in less developed states and union territories. Monetary Policy As a part of the conduct of monetary policy, the RBI monitors, inter alia , monetary and credit aggregates. It uses both liquidity and interest rate instruments to achieve the monitory policy objectives. Pre-emptive actions have been taken since 2004 to withdraw monetary accommodation which was reinforced wi th measures aimed at moderating early signs of over-heating. Further, appreciati on of the possible permanent and temporary components with regard to oil prices has been articulated in the policies. While undertaking a nuanced approach to managing aggregate demand recognising the elements of shock and consequent impact on inflation expectations, the underlying  14demand conditions warranted several interest rate and liquidity measures in recent weeks.   While monetary policy influences aggregat es, reality is often dis-aggregated. Hence, the RBI uses prudential regulatory policies to complement the monetary policy measures and objectives. It is pertinent that the lender of last resort function is not separate either from monetary and liquidit y management or from financial regulation. Thus both monetary policy and prudential regulations are used as complementary tools to achieve the central bank objectives and they both support and reinforce each other. IV. Concluding Remarks on Broader Issues    The detailed account given above of the developments in the global and the Indian financial sector would be incomplete without devoting some attention to the broader issues. These issues need to be reckoned and debated widely lest the response to recent developments be construed as internal to the financial sector, warranting only such sector-specific solutions. First, whether the benefits of financial liberalisation and financial globalisation need to be re-evaluated? It is possible to argue that liberalisation of trade in goods has contributed more to growth and price stability than financial sector initiatives. In particular, it may be argued that the incentive frameworks for financial intermediaries appear to be disproportionate to their conceivable contribution to the economy. The arguments in favour of persevering with financial innovation and urging regulators to continue to give priority to facilitate innovations should be viewed in this context. Second, whether the regulators have placed greater emphasis on savings of capital in banks rather than on the interests of the depositors and on systemic stability? The recent compulsions for shoring up of capital by some of the global financial institutions in advanced economies seem to suggest this. What induced the regulators to permit such excesses in leverage and savings of capital? Does this also involve issues pertaining to governance and accountability of regulators? Third, whether there is a beginning of fiscalisation of the financial sector in view of the intensification of the links between the two? For example, the recent episodes of participation of the sovereign wealth funds in the re-capitalisation of banks tantamount to fiscal support. Further, large doses of liquidity support to financial markets by regulators against collateral may also involve quasi-fiscal costs, under some circumstances.   15 Fourth, whether there is, what may be ca lled, financialisation of the political economy? The attractiveness of financial interm ediaries in terms of high profitability, significant growth – especially cross-border, massive spread of investors, and the inadequate scope for application of principles of rules of origin in the financial sector could have resulted in enhanced clout for thes e intermediaries in the political economy. Incidentally, Professor Jagdish Bhagwati’s reference to Wall Street – Washington links is relevant in this context.   Fifth, whether there has been excessive financialisation of corporates, in the sense that large corporates take significant positions in the financial markets through their treasury operations? Increasingly, many of the positions of the corporates in the financial markets may not be related to their underlying business. Do we have an issue when such activities of corporates in the financial mark ets, unrelated to their underlying business, are not regulated the way similar activities of financial market intermediaries are regulated?  To conclude, on the way forward, to exit the current financial turbulence and fortify against future similar episodes, we may need to look beyond reforms within the financial sector and address broader related issues that impinge on the balance between the sovereign, the regulators, the financial institutions and the markets.  Thank you. "", '1Development of Local Currency Bond Markets:The Indian ExperienceShyamala Gopinath1It gives me great pleasure to participate in the Workshop on ""Debt, Finance and EmergingIssues in Financial Integration"", being organized by the Financing for Development Office,United Nations in collaboration with the Commonwealth Business Council andCommonwealth Secretariat. In my presentation, I would like to highlight the Indianexperience with regard to the development of debt markets.As you are all aware, the imperative of developing domestic debt markets has beenreinforced by the lessons of the financial crises that affected a large number of countries inEast Asia and elsewhere in the late 1990s. Indeed, the significance of a well-diversifiedfinancial system, including a deep and liquid bond market, that obviates excessivedependence on the banking system, and helps avoiding the double mismatches of currencyand maturity, was quite tellingly felt in the context of the crisis.In India, the development of government bond market has been taken up as part of thestructural reforms process initiated in 1991-92 in the aftermath of the external paymentscrisis in the previous year. The external payments crisis was largely engendered by thedeteriorating fiscal situation during the previous decade which was marked by high andpersistent fiscal and revenue deficits, substantial debt-servicing burden, captive use of bankresources at sub-market clearing rates and increasing recourse to monetary financing of thebudget deficit with its attendant inflationary consequences. The structural reform processthat was initiated as a response to the crisis included apart from fiscal reforms, industrialderegulation, liberalization of foreign direct investment, trade liberalization and financialsector reforms. The objective of these wide-ranging reforms was to place the economy on ahigher growth trajectory by inducing greater efficiency and competitiveness in all spheres ofactivity. Within this overall context, reforms in the Government securities market wereundertaken essentially to finance the budgetary requirements of the government in a non-inflationary and more ‘efficient’ manner; develop a benchmark for the pricing and valuationof other securities; and facilitate monetary policy operations through indirect instruments inthe context of a liberalised financial environment.                                               1 Paper presented by Smt. Shyamala Gopinath, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at theWorkshop on \'Debt, Finance and Emerging Issues in Financial Integration’, organized byCommonwealth Secretariat London, March 6-7, 2007. Assistance provided by Mr. Somnath Chatterjiin preparation of the paper is gratefully acknowledged.2Under India’s federal system of government, the Constitution allocates the revenue powersand expenditure functions between the Central and State Governments. The CentralGovernment can borrow both within and outside the country. It is worth noting in thiscontext, that even though combined fiscal deficit of the Central and State Governments inIndia has been among the highest in the world, the Government did not have to resort toexternal borrowing, except from bilateral and multilateral sources. This has rendered greaterstability to the system.Borrowing by the State Governments is subordinated to prior approval by the CentralGovernment. This is embodied in Article 293 of the Indian Constitution, under which, anyState Government that is indebted to the Central Government, requires prior approvalbefore borrowing from financial markets. Furthermore, State Governments are not permittedto borrow externally, unlike the Centre.The local debt market comprises the Government securities market (of both the CentralGovernment and the 28 State Governments) and the corporate bond market. The ReserveBank of India (RBI) is the banker to and manager of marketable internal debt of the CentralGovernment by statute. Internal marketable debt, at present, accounts for around 40 percent of the total outstanding debt of the Central Government, whereas net marketborrowings account for around 77 per cent of the Gross Fiscal Deficit (GFD). The RBI is abanker to and manager of the marketable debt of the State Governments under voluntaryagreements. Internal marketable debt, at present, accounts for around 20 per cent of thetotal outstanding liabilities of the State Governments whereas net market borrowingsaccount for around 20 per cent of their GFD.Against this backdrop, the structure of my presentation is as follows. In Section, I shallbriefly trace the evolution of deficits and debt of the Central Government over the period ofreforms. In Section II, I shall discuss the various initiatives for the development of theCentral Government debt market. Section III would highlight the impact of the reforms onvarious parameters of the Central Government debt market. The next two Sections would bedevoted to the trends in the deficits and debt of the State Governments and issues relatingto their market borrowings, respectively. Issues relating to the development of the corporatebond market would be covered in Section VI. The Concluding Section would highlight a fewissues in the way ahead.3I. Trends in Budget Deficits and Debt of the Central GovernmentThree distinct phases in fiscal performance of the Central Government are evident since theinitiation of reforms in 1991-92. In the first phase , which lasted upto the mid-1990s, therewas a significant reduction in fiscal deficit from around 8 per cent to 5 per cent of GDP andin the public debt from 55 per cent to 51 per cent of GDP. During this period, fiscalcorrection primarily reflected curtailment of investment expenditure, even while major taxreforms were initiated via reduction/rationalization of rates and widening of the tax base.Table 1: Trends in Centre’s Budget Deficits  (as per cent of GDP)1990-911991-921995-962000-012001-022002-032003-042004-052005-062006-07(RE) (BE)Gross FiscalDeficit7.85 5.56 5.07 5.64 6.18 5.92 4.47 4.01 4.14 3.76RevenueDeficit3.26 2.49 2.50 4.01 4.39 4.40 3.56 2.51 2.60 2.14Gross PrimaryDeficit4.07 1.49 0.86 0.93 1.47 1.11 -0.03 -0.06 0.46 0.22Table 2: Financing Pattern of the Centre’s Gross Fiscal Deficit (in per cent)1990-911991-921995-962000-012001-022002-032003-042004-052005-062006-07(RE) (BE)ExternalFinance7.1 14.9 0.5 6.3 4.0 -8.2 -10.9 11.8 5.1 5.6MarketBorrowing17.9 20.7 56.4 61.8 64.4 71.8 72.1 40.7 69.2 76.5OthersBorrowing49.5 45.5 26.8 32.9 32.7 35.2 42.0 54.0 15.4 17.9Note: The balance amount represents draw down of cash balances4Chart 1: Trends in the Debt of the Central and State Governments (as a ratio to GDP)01020304050607080901980-81 1990-91 1996-97 2000-01 2004.05 2006-07(BE)Per centCentre States TotalIn the second phase , which covered the next five to six years, there was, however, asignificant reversal of trend with the fiscal deficit and public debt increasing, as a ratio toGDP, to around 6 per cent and 64 per cent, respectively. The revenue deficit increased toover 4 per cent of GDP during this period, which was even higher than the level prevailingon the eve of the crisis. Deterioration in the fiscal situation during the second phase evenwhile reform efforts continued, was related, inter-alia , to (a) the slowdown in the growth rateof the economy which adversely impacted on tax revenues; (b) upsurge in expenditures onwages and salaries of the government sector consequent to the Fifth Pay Commissionaward; and (c) the increase in interest payments following the sharp rise in yields onGovernment securities in the first phase following the introduction of auctions.In the third phase , which began in 2002-03, signs of improvement in the fiscal situation areagain evident, with the fiscal deficit and revenue deficit progressively reduced to around 4per cent and 2 per cent of GDP, respectively. (In fact, as per the recently released UnionBudget for 2007-08, the fiscal deficit and the revenue deficit have been placed at 3.3 percent and 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2007-08). The debt-GDP ratio has begun inchingdownwards, even though its level remains on the higher side at around 62 per cent. The on-going improvement in the fiscal situation in the third phase can be attributed to a rebound ineconomic growth to a higher trajectory which, in turn, has positively impacted on taxbuoyancy as well as enhanced fiscal discipline following the enactment of fiscalresponsibility legislation, to which we now turn.5The Central Government\'s Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003(FRBMA)  came into force in August 2003 and associated Fiscal Rules were notified in July2004. In terms of the Act, the Centre was required to eliminate its revenue deficit by end-March 2008, and thereafter build up adequate revenue surplus. The rules under the Actfurther require the Centre to reduce the revenue deficit by an equivalent of at least 0.5 percent of GDP at the end of each fiscal year beginning 2004-05. The Gross Fiscal Deficit(GFD) is to be reduced by at least 0.3 per cent of GDP at the   end of each fiscal yearbeginning 2004-05, so that it is brought down to 3 per cent of GDP in 2008. The FinanceAct, 2004 shifted the targets fixed for end-March 2008 in respect of the revenue deficit andGFD to end-March 2009 (consistent with the fiscal restructuring plan envisaged by theTwelfth Finance Commission). The enactment of FRBMA provides a clear direction to thefiscal consolidation process and enhances the credibility of fiscal policies. Furthermore, interms of the provisions of the FRBMA, the RBI is prohibited from subscribing to the primaryissuances of Central Government securities with effect from April 2006. This will completethe transition to a fully market-based issuance of Central Government securities.I would like to conclude this Section by highlighting that the share of external debt in thetotal debt of the Central Government has been low even before the initiation of the reforms.All the external loans were obtained from multilateral/bilateral sources. Subsequent to thereforms, the share of external loans declined substantially. The Government of India has notborrowed on ‘commercial’ basis externally.Chart 2: Composition of Centre’s Debt0.020.040.060.080.0100.0Per cent1950-51 1980-81 1990-91 2000-01 2006-07(BE) Domestic Liabilities External Liabilities6II. Initiatives for the Development of the Central Government Securities MarketAs indicated earlier, the pre-reform period was characterized by a substantial and sustainedincrease in the fiscal deficit of the Government. While such budgetary imbalances hadadverse macroeconomic consequences, these also necessitated large issuance ofgovernment securities in India, which formed the basis for the development of a governmentsecurities market.The Government securities market before the 1990s was characterised by administeredinterest rates, high Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) requirements that led to the existence ofcaptive investors, and the absence of a liquid and transparent secondary market for G-Secs.Low coupon rates were offered on Government securities to keep Government borrowingcosts down, which made real rates of return negative for several years till the mid-1980s.During the 1980s, the volume of Government debt expanded considerably, particularlyshort-term debt, due to automatic accommodation to Central Government by the ReserveBank, through the mechanism of ad hoc Treasury Bills. However, with a captive investorbase and low interest rates, the secondary market for Government bonds remaineddormant. Artificial yields on Government securities affected the yield structure of financialassets in the system, and led to an overall high interest rate environment in the rest of themarket. Driven by these compulsions, the Reserve Bank’s monetary management wascharacterised by a regime of administered interest rates, and rising Cash Reserve Ratio(CRR) and SLR prescriptions. High CRR and SLR left little room for monetarymanoeuvering. Furthermore, the period was marked by greater pre-emption of financialsavings. Given such high pre-emptions and administered interest rates which were artificiallykept lower than the market rates, there was no possibility of price discovery. Reforms in theGovernment securities market undertaken as part of the overall structural reforms processinitiated in 1991-92, aimed to redress these infirmities.The early initiatives  (1992-95) in the reform of the G-sec market which aimed at creatingan enabling environment included (i) the elimination of the automatic monetization of thebudget deficit of the Central Government, and in its place putting in a system of Ways andMeans Advances, to facilitate further reforms in the market and facilitate monetary policyformulation; (ii) switch to market-related interest rates on Government securities to facilitateprice discovery and (iii) bringing down SLR to its statutory minimum level of 25 per cent;The second phase  (1995-2000) of reforms was directed towards institutional developmentto enhance market activity, settlement and safety. These reforms included (i) establishment7of a Delivery versus Payment system, to reduce settlement risk; (ii) Institution of the systemof Primary Dealers, to strengthen market intermediation; (iii) formation of market bodiessuch as Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA) andPrimary Dealers Association of India (PDAI) to improve practices; and (iv) permission toForeign Institutional Investors to invest in Government securities in both the primary andsecondary markets, with a view to broaden the markets;Instrument diversification  was also undertaken during this phase of reforms. Prior to the1990s, most of the government bond issuances were in the form of plain vanilla, fixedcoupon securities. In order to meet the diverse funding and hedging needs of participants,various types of instruments such as zero coupon bonds, capital indexed bonds, floatingrate bonds and bonds with call and put options, were introduced.Floating Rate Bonds (FRBs)  were introduced in September 1995, but did not evoke muchresponse. These were again issued in November 2001 with some modification in theirstructure. Overwhelming market response paved the way for subsequent issuances tillOctober 2004. The latter issuances of FRBs, however, again failed to evoke adequatemarket response. This was attributed, inter-alia, to low secondary market liquidity (sincethese are essentially hedging instruments and offer limited scope for trading gains) andcomplex pricing methodology in the secondary market.Capital Indexed bonds (CIB)  were issued in December 1997. Subsequent to that issuance,there was no further issuance of CIB mainly due to lack of an enthusiastic response ofmarket participants for the instrument, both in primary and secondary markets. Some of thereasons cited for the lackluster response were: (a) it only offered inflation hedging for theprincipal, while the coupons of the bond were left unprotected against inflation and (b)complexities involved in pricing of the instrument.Hence, plain vanilla bonds continue to be predominant in the issuances of Governmentsecurities.The (on-going) third phase  (2000 onwards) of reforms is aimed at enhancing liquidity andefficiency of the G-Sec market. Some of the important initiatives in this phase are: (i)introduction of a Liquidity Adjustment Facility by the Reserve Bank to manage short-termliquidity mismatches; (ii) operationalisation of the Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) --- anautomated electronic trading platform --- and the Clearing Corporation of India Limited(CCIL) for trading and settlement/guaranteed settlement by a central counterparty and bring8in straight through processing; (iii) introduction of trading of G-secs in stock exchanges; (iv)introduction of exchange-traded Interest Rate Futures to facilitate hedging of market risk; (v)introduction of Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) which would facilitate liquiditymanagement; (vi) DvP III mode of settlement has been enabled which permits netsettlement of both funds and securities legs; (vii) announcement of an indicative auctioncalendar for Treasury Bills and dated securities, to help investors plan their investmentbetter and to enhance transparency and stability in the Government securities market; and(viii) introduction of the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) which has expanded theinstruments available to the Reserve Bank for managing the surplus liquidity in the system.Proceeds of Government paper issued via auctions under the MSS to mop up liquiditygenerated on account of the accretion to the Reserve Bank’s foreign assets are parked withthe Reserve Bank to neutralise the monetary impact of capital flows.  The objective of MSSis essentially to differentiate the liquidity absorption of a more enduring nature by way ofsterilisation from the day-to-day normal liquidity management operations (under LAF).Government paper issued under MSS is no different from other Government securitiesissued under the borrowing program. These securities also trade in the secondary market aspart of other stock.Initiatives were also taken to widen the investor base for G-secs. Traditionally, the investorbase for government securities in India has been banks, financial institutions, ProvidentFunds (PFs), insurance and pension funds but commercial banks and Life InsuranceCorporation of India (LIC) are the largest holders. Most of the holdings of these investors arein the nature of statutorily mandated investments. This category has been further diversifiedby the entry of cooperative banks, regional rural banks, mutual funds and non-bankingfinance companies in the recent period. In addition, the entry of 100 per cent Gilt MutualFunds has broadened the retail investor base. To enable small and medium sized investorsto participate in the primary auction of government securities, a “Scheme of Non CompetitiveBidding” was introduced in January 2002, which is open to any person including firms,companies, corporate bodies, institutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entityprescribed by RBI. The scheme provides for allocation of up to 5 per cent of the notifiedamount at the weighted average rate of accepted bids. Investors can bid through banks orPDs a minimum amount of Rs.10,000 to a maximum amount of Rs. 20 million. A few PDshave already introduced schemes for retail marketing of Government securities using thenetwork of bank branches and post offices.9Foreign portfolio investors [called Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs)] are also permitted toinvest in G-Secs subject to a limit that is currently placed at US$2.6 billion, to increase toUS$3.2 billion by the end of the year.With effect from the fiscal year 2006-07, as per the provisions under the FiscalResponsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act 2003 , the Reserve Bank\'sparticipation in the primary market for Central Government securities stands withdrawn. Thishas necessitated significant changes in the setting and operating framework of monetary,debt management and regulatory policies of the Reserve Bank.In order to address these emerging needs and equip RBI as well as the market participantsappropriately, a Technical Group on Central Government Securities Market was constitutedwhich proposed a medium-term framework for the evolution of the Central Governmentsecurities market.On the basis of the recommendations of the above Group, the Reserve Bank\'s AnnualPolicy Statement of April 2005 indicated that in the post-FRBM period, the Reserve Bankwould reorient government debt management operations while simultaneouslystrengthening monetary operations. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank constituted a newdepartment named as Financial Markets Department (FMD) in July 2005 with a view tomoving towards functional separation between debt management and monetary operations.Second, it was proposed that the number of actively traded securities would be enlarged toenhance liquidity and improve pricing in the market through active consolidation inconsultation with the Government while continuing the programme of reissuances. In thisregard, the Annual Policy Statement of April 2006 had proposed that identified illiquidsecurities will be bought from the secondary market by the Reserve Bank and once a criticalamount of securities is acquired, they would be bought back by the Government toextinguish the stock. The modalities of consolidation are being worked out in consultationwith the Government.Third, the settlement system for transactions in government securities was standardised toT+1 cycle effective May 11, 2005 with a view to provide the participants with moreprocessing time at their disposal and therefore, to enable better management of both fundsas well as risk.Fourth, in order to provide banks and other institutions with a more advanced and moreefficient trading platform, an anonymous order matching trading platform (NDS-OM) was10introduced with effect from August 01, 2005. The participation in the NDS-OM platform hasbeen extended (beyond banks, PDs and financial institutions) to insurance companies, allqualified mutual funds, provident funds and pension funds. The NDS-OM is an additionalfacility available to the participants and the participants continue to have the option of usingthe current telephone trading platform. The settlements of both types of transactions are,however, integrated.Fifth, intra-day short sale was permitted in dated Government securities subject to certainstipulations with effect from February 28, 2006.  This was done because it was observedthat in the absence of instruments that allow players to take a view on the interest rates, themarkets were active and liquid when the rates were falling but turned lackluster and illiquidwhen the rates increased. Short sales would enable market participants to express theirviews on interest rate expectations, manage their interest rate risk more efficiently and alsoimpart liquidity to the markets, even in a rising interest rate scenario. The period of shortsale has recently been extended to five days.Sixth, guidelines for introduction of \'when issued\' market in Central government securitiesmarket were issued on May 3, 2006. This would facilitate an efficient distribution process forGovernment securities by stretching the actual distribution period for each issue andallowing the market more time to absorb large issues without disruption, in addition toproviding better price discovery.Seventh, PDs have been permitted to diversify their activities, as considered appropriate, inaddition to their core business of Government securities, subject to limits. This would enablebetter risk management through generation of alternative sources of income.Eighth, guidelines on the extension of PD business to banks which fulfil certain minimumeligibility criteria were issued on February 27, 2006.Ninth, a revised scheme for underwriting commitment and liquidity support to PDs has beenintroduced with effect from April 1, 2006 whereby PDs are required to meet 100 per centunderwriting commitment in each auction, replacing the earlier requirement of biddingcommitment and voluntary underwriting (which did not guarantee that the notified amountwill be sold in each auction).11III. Impact of Reforms on the Central Government Securities MarketAs a result of gradual reform measures taken over the years, the Indian G-Sec market hasbecome increasingly broad-based, characterised by an efficient auction process, an activesecondary market and a liquid yield curve up to 30 years. The market is now supported byan active Primary Dealer (PD) system and electronic trading and settlement technology thatensure safe settlement with Straight Through Processing (STP) and central counterpartyguarantee.The outstanding stock of G-secs as on end-March 2006 is nearly thirteen times the level in1992. Outstanding stock of G-secs as a ratio to GDP has nearly doubled to around 28 percent over this period. Turnover of G-secs has been placed at well over 200 per cent inrecent years as against 34 per cent in 1996.Table 3 It is pertinent to add here that recently the Government of India converted (non-tradable)special securities amounting to nearly Rs.900 billion issued to banks towards capitalinfusion, into tradable, SLR Government of India dated securities. The substitution of non-tradable securities to tradable securities is expected to facilitate increased access of thebanking sector to additional resources for lending to productive sectors, in the light of theincreasing credit needs of the economy.It may be also important to note that the Reserve Bank has been encouraging the growth ofthe collateralized money market with the objective minimizing default risk in the moneymarket. As a consequence, there has been a major shift in transactions from theuncollateralized to the collateralized segment, underscoring the development of the G-secmarket.1992 1996 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006O utstanding stock (R s. in billion) 769 1375 5363 6739 8,243 8,953 9,767O utstanding stock as ratio of G D P  (per cent)14.68 14.2 27.89 27.2929.87 28.69 27.67Turnover / G D P  (per cent) -- 34.21 157.68 202.88 217.3 239.9 212.9Average m aturity of the securities issued during the year (in Y ears) -- 5.7 14.3 13.8 14.94 14.13 16.9W eighted average cost of the securities issued during the year (P er cent)11.78 13.77 9.44 7.34 5.71 6.11 7.34M inim um  and m axim um  m aturities of stock issued during the year (in Y ears) N .A. 2-10 5-25 7-30 4-30 5-30 5-30S n ap sh ot o f the In d ian G -S ec M arket12During the greater part of the 1990s, the maturity of Central Government securities rangedupto 10 years. This resulted in potential redemption pressure and rollover risk. With a viewto address these concerns as also to develop the yield curve for longer tenors, the ReserveBank progressively increased the tenors upto 30 years by early 2000. As a consequence,the weighted average maturity of securities increased from 5.5 years in 1995-96 to 16.9years in 2005-06; the weighted average maturity during 2006-07 so far works out to 14.6years. The weighted average yield of securities also declined from 13.8 per cent in 1995-96to 5.7 per cent in 2003-04. Since then, it has increased to 7.3 per cent in 2005-06 andfurther to 7.9 per cent in 2006-07 so far.Chart 3: Weighted Average Yield and Weighted Average MaturityThe Reserve Bank\'s efforts to elongate the maturity profile resulted in a smooth and reliableyield curve to act as a benchmark for the other markets for pricing and valuation purposes.The Indian yield curve today compares with not only emerging market economies but alsothe developed world.0246810121416181995-961996-971997-981998-991999-002000-012001-022002-032003-042004-052005-06Per cent / YearsWeighted Average Yield (per cent) Weighted Average Maturity (years)13Chart 4: Central G-secs Yield Curves02468101214161 3 5 7 911 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29Maturity (Years)Per centMar-97 Mar-04 Jan-07The process of passive consolidation (through reopening of existing stock instead of issuingnew securities every time) has helped in containing the number of bonds around the levelthat was prevailing at the end of 1998-99. This was a significant factor that promotedsecondary market liquidity for Government Securities.Market liquidity today compares well not only with the emerging economies, but also withthe developed world, with bid-offer spreads in benchmark securities at 1-2 bps. Theilliquidity premium levels are also in line with those in the international markets.The holding of G-secs among financial institutions has been more diversified, particularly,with the emergence of insurance and pension funds as a \'durable\' investor class for thelong-term securities. This became possible due to the sustained efforts devoted toelongating the maturity profile of Government securities by developing a smooth and robustyield curve.14 Chart 5: Ownership Pattern of Central G-Secs: 199125%56%13%0%0%1%0%0%5%Reserve Bank of India (own account)Commercial BanksLife Insurance Corporation of India #Unit Trust of IndiaNABARDEmployees Provident Fund SchemeCoal Mines Provident Fund SchemePrimary dealersOthersChart 6: Ownership Pattern of Central G-Secs: 20057%53%20%0%0%2%0%0%16%Reserve Bank of India(own account)Commercial BanksLife InsuranceCorporation of India #Unit Trust of IndiaNABARDEmployees ProvidentFund SchemeCoal Mines ProvidentFund SchemePrimary dealersOthersIt may be observed from the above charts that over the period 1991 to 2005, the share ofthe Reserve Bank in the holdings of Government securities has declined significantly, whilethat of Life Insurance Corporation has increased. The share of commercial banks has alsodeclined, albeit  slightly, but they continue to account for the predominant share of holdings.Currently a large portion of G-secs is held in the investment portfolio of banks. As and whenit becomes possible to lower the SLR (via the recent Ordinance), it will become even moreimportant to widen the investor base. The market making role of PDs will also become moreimportant and they will have to make extra efforts to widen the investor base to add playerssuch as provident funds, pension funds, cooperative banks, trusts, NGOs and otherinstitutions.15It is significant to note that the debt management operations of the Reserve Bank arecomparable to best global practices as these substantially adhere to the public debtmanagement guidelines of the IMF/World Bank (Annex) .IV. Evolution of State Government FinancesThe story at the State Government level is somewhat similar to that of the Centre. Thedeterioration in the fiscal situation which began in the late 1980s, accelerated in thefollowing decade consequent to the Fifth Pay Commission award as also the slackening ofCentral devolution and transfer of resources to the States in the face of a slowdown in thegrowth rate. At the same time, State finances have been long afflicted with stagnant non-taxrevenues as a consequence of inappropriate user charges on various services. Indeed, theGFD and the revenue deficit had increased to over 4  per cent and over 2.5 per cent ofGDP, in the early years of the present decade, while the debt was placed at over 33 percent of GDP.Table 4: Trends in the Budget Deficits of the State Governments (as a per cent ofGDP)1990-911991-921995-962000-012001-022002-032003-042004-052005-062006-07(RE) (BE)GFD 3.3 2.89 2.65 4.25 4.21 4.17 4.46 3.5 3.23 2.68RevenueDeficit0.93 0.87 0.69 2.54 2.59 2.25 2.22 1.17 0.49 0.05Gross PrimaryDeficit1.78 1.22 0.8 0.09 -0.15 -0.61 -0.75 -1.65 -2.03 -2.47Table 5: Financing Pattern of the Gross Fiscal Deficit of the State Governments  (inper cent)1990-911991-921995-962000-012001-022002-032003-042004-052005-062006-07(RE) (BE)Loan FromCentralGov.53.1 49.6 47.1 9.4 11.4 -0.9 11.5 -15.1 2.3 4.8MarketBorrowing12.0 17.5 18.7 14.0 18.0 27.9 38.4 30.1 15.7 21.0NSSF - - - 36.4 37.1 51.2 16.9 66.5 65.0 53.516Others 33.3 32.9 34.2 40.2 33.5 21.9 33.2 18.5 17.0 20.7The recommendations of the Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC) are an important milestonein the fiscal path of the States (and Central) Governments over the five-year periodbeginning 2005-06. The TFC recommended for the elimination of Central loans to States fortheir Plan schemes beginning 2005-06, although there will be some transitionalarrangements. Thus, the borrowing of the State Governments will be increasing marketdetermined, paving the way for the emergence of a vibrant sub-national debt market. TheTFC also recommended a fiscal restructuring plan under which revenue deficit would beeliminated and the fiscal deficit would be reduced to 3 per cent of GDP, separately for theCentre and the States. In order to incentivise adherence to the fiscal restructuring plan, theTFC recommended a debt relief scheme linked to the enactment of fiscal responsibilitylegislation by the States with provisions consistent with the restructuring plan.The TFC recommendation accelerated the enactment of fiscal responsibility legislation atthe State level. As many as 24 States have enacted Fiscal Responsibility Legislation (FRL)as compared with only 5 States in 2003-04. As in the case of the Centre, the State FRLsprovide for the elimination of the revenue deficit as well as the reduction of the GFD-GSDP(Gross State Domestic Product) ratio to 3 per cent by 2008-09. The enactment of FRLenhances the credibility of the fiscal consolidation process at the State level. The revenuedeficit has been reduced to 0.5 per cent of GDP in 2005-06, whereas the GFD has declinedto 3.2 per cent of GDP. Most of the States now have sizable cash surpluses in sharpcontrast to the liquidity pressures witnessed less than four years ago. Some of the Stateshave, in this context, proposed to buy-back some of their high-cost securities issued in thepast, so as to reduce the \'carrying cost\' on their balances. Such a buy-back auction wasrecently conducted by the Reserve Bank.V. Issues in the Development of the State Government Securities MarketTill 1998-99, open market borrowings of State Governments were conducted entirelythrough tap issuances wherein the coupon rate was fixed as a mark up over the yield of aCentral Government security of corresponding maturity. With the objective of providing ascope for better-managed State Governments to access funds at market rates, the auctionroute was provided to them as an option. During 2006-07 so far, the auction routeaccounted for 100 per cent of the market borrowings of the State Governments, ascompared with 48.5 per cent in the previous year and 2.3 per cent in 2004-05. Moreover, in17all but one auction of State Government securities during 2006-07 so far, the spreads of thecut-off yields over the secondary market yields of a Central Government security ofcorresponding maturity have remained lower than that of 50 basis points (which is thespread fixed in the case of tap issuances). This is indicative of a number of factors includingimproved market perception of the State Governments and better timing of issues. All thesecurities issued during 2006-07 so far were of 10-year maturity. The weighted averageyield, which had declined from nearly 13 per cent in 1997-98 to around 6 per cent in 2003-04, has progressively increased to around 8 per cent in 2006-07 so far.  State Governmentsecurities are, however, beset with the problem of negligible level of secondary marketliquidity. This has been attributed to certain interrelated factors such as, (i) low level ofoutstanding stock resulting in an even lower floating stock, (ii) predominance of buy-and-hold investors, (iii) disconnect between the uniform coupon fixed in respect of Statesparticipating in a tap issue with their corresponding secondary market yields, and (iv)fragmentation across issuers (28 States) and securities (each State issuing up to eight newsecurities in a year). With a view to improving the liquidity as also to widen the investor basein State Government securities, active consideration is being given to extend the facility ofnon-competitive bidding (currently limited to Central Government dated securities) to theprimary auction of State Government securities and also to introduce purchase and resale ofState Government securities by the Reserve Bank under the overnight LAF repo operations.VI. Development of the Corporate Bond MarketThe Reserve Bank plays an indirect role in the development of corporate bond market,essentially guided by its interest in monetary policy transmission, Government securities,and stability as well as efficiency in financial sector as a whole as banks have a major role inthe corporate bond market. While significant strides have been made in the development ofthe Government Securities market, the corporate debt market has a long way to go. Thoughthe corporate debt market in India has been in existence since independence in 1947, it wasonly after 1985-86, following some debt market reforms that State owned public enterprises(PSUs) began issuing PSU bonds. Such debt instruments, however, generally remainedhighly illiquid and unpopular among the  investors since a well-functioning secondary marketwas absent. However, corporates continued to prefer private placements to public issues.The predilection  towards private placement has been attributed to several factors, viz., easeof procedures and operation of private placement, involved procedure and considerablyhigher costs of public issues, and higher subscriptions for private placements. Mainly as aconsequence of this, the financial institutions have tended to dominate public issues in theprimary corporate debt market. The secondary market for corporate debt has also certain18shortcomings in terms of  lack of market-making resulting in poor liquidity, tendency on thepart of institutional investors to hold these securities to maturity and the consequentreduction in market supply of these securities.Several measures have been taken in the recent past to transform the corporate debtmarket in India. Some of these measures include de-materialisation and electronic transferof securities, rolling settlement, introduction of sophisticated risk management, trading andsettlement systems. Towards the end of 2003, SEBI also initiated reforms in the privateplacement market. In conjunction with these measures, Reserve Bank of India, issuedguidelines to banks on investment of their non-SLR securities. All these measures areexpected to improve the functioning of corporate debt market in India.The High Level Expert Committee on Corporate Bonds and Securitisation (Chairman: Dr. R.H. Patil) (2005) observed that the primary corporate debt market is dominated by privateplacements by essentially financial institutions (including banks and non-bankingcompanies) with fairly low levels of transparency until recently. Secondary market tradingand settlement procedures are rather archaic with settlement not even DvP based. There isa growing primary market for securitized instruments but hardly any trading activity is seen.In this background the Expert Committee had recommended measures to enhance activitylevel as well as efficiency of corporate debt markets. Some of the importantrecommendations relate to the following:(i) To encourage a well-developed primary issuance process, the Committee suggestedsteps to enhance the issuer base and investor base including measures to bring in retailinvestors. Listing of primary issues and creation of a centralized database of primary issueswas proposed to improve transparency and disclosure standards.(ii)  For an all-round development of the secondary market, the Committee recommended anelectronic trading system, a comprehensive automated trade reporting system and safe andefficient clearing and settlement standards. It was also suggested that repo in corporatebonds may be allowed (currently only Government securities are eligible collateral forrepos).The Committee also recommended a host of measures, including legal and tax aspects togive a boost to the securitized debt market, including suggestions to promote creditenhancement and creation of specialized debt funds to fund infrastructure projects. TheCommittee also suggested incentives for developments of a municipal bond market. Therecommendations have been accepted by the Government and are under implementation.19Securitisation2Securitisation as a financial instrument has been existing in India since the early 1990s –essentially as a device of bilateral acquisitions of portfolios of finance companies.  Therewere quasi-securitisations for quite a while where creation of any form of security was rareand the portfolios simply moved from balance sheet of one originator over to that of another.These transactions often included provisions which provided recourse to the originator aswell. Now, loan sales is common through the direct assignment route, which is structuredusing the true sale concept. Securitisation of auto loans was the mainstay of the Indiansecuritization market through most the 1990s. Since 2000, residential mortgage backedsecurities has fuelled the growth in the market.In the early stage of securitization in India, creation of transferable securities in the form ofpass-through certificates (PTCs) was the most common form of securitization. PTC hasalmost become synonymous with securitisation in India and most market practitioners do notenvisage issuance of notes or bonds as a securitised product. There are PTCs which have aspecific coupon rate, there are structured PTCs and PTCs have different payback periods.Many PTCs are essentially derived debt instruments but they are not called as such.Over time, the market has spread into several asset classes – while auto loans andresidential housing loans are still the mainstay, there are corporate loans, commercialmortgage receivables, future flow, project receivables, toll revenues, etc that have beensecuritised.Trend in Structured Finance Issuance Volumes (in Rs. billion)Type FY 2002 FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 FY 2006ABS 12.9 36.4 80.9 222.9 178.5MBS 0.8 14.8 29.6 33.4 50.1CDO/LSO 19.1 24.3 28.3 25.8 21.0PF 4.0 1.9 0.0 16.0 0.0Others 0.0 0.4 0.5 10.0 6.8Total 36.8 77.7 139.2 308.2 256.5Source ICRARegulatory framework: T here is currently no regulatory framework for securitization marketin general. However, securitizations originated by RBI regulated entities viz. banks, FIs andNBFCs are governed by guidelines issued by RBI. Enactment of SARFAESI enabledsecuritiastion of NPAs by banks, which could sell off their NPAs to ARCs registered withRBI. More recently, RBI has issued guidelines for secutisation of standard assets by Banks,FIs and NBFC which are in accordance with international best practices in February 2006                                               2 This section draws mainly on the Patil Committee report on Corporate Bonds and Securitisation20which provides regulatory framework for several critical aspects of securitization. Recently,an amendment has been proposed to SCRA which recognizes pass-through certificates(PTC) as eligible securities to be listed and traded on exchanges.VII. Concluding ObservationsThe discussion in the previous Sections is indicative of the large ground that has sofar been covered by reforms in the Government securities market in India. It will also benoted that India, unlike amny other developing countries developed local currencyGovernment bond market with investors being largely domestic. Investment by foreigners indebt market is calibrated through overall limits.In this context, the extant macroeconomic conditions provide an ideal setting to carryforward the reform process in the G-Sec market. Indeed, an annual growth rate averagingover 8 per cent in the last three years; a savings rate of nearly 30 per cent; theentrenchment of a rule-based fiscal consolidation process; a modest current account deficit,low and rapidly declining level of external debt and a sharp build up of foreign exchangereserves, provide a conducive environment for further development of the G-Sec market.The inflation rate, which had declined substantially from its level in the first half of the 1990s,has remained fairly stable since then. The recent increase in the inflation rate to over 6 percent has engendered a host of countervailing measures by the Government and theReserve Bank to expeditiously realign the inflation rate within the stated range of 5.0 to 5.5per cent while continuing to pursue the medium-term goal of a ceiling on inflation at 5.0 percent. Continued stability in the inflation rate would positively impact on the development ofthe G-Sec market. Additionally, it would be imperative to adhere to the provisions of thefiscal responsibility legislations of both the Centre and the State Governments so as toenhance the credibility of fiscal policies, impart greater stability to financial markets andfurther strengthen macroeconomic fundamentals.  It would also be necessary to continue the efforts to develop a deep and liquid G-Sec market. Notwithstanding passive consolidation through reissuances, the number ofactively traded securities remains low relative to the number of securities outstanding. Thisresults in a kinked yield curve which impedes pricing of securities. The finer modalities forimplementing the scheme are being worked out.         The possibility of reintroducing instruments like Inflation-Indexed Bonds and FloatingRate Bonds is also being explored by addressing the observed infirmities in the earlier\'avatars\' of these instruments, as highlighted in Section II.21STRIPS could also be introduced with the enactment of the Government Securities Act thatwould facilitate lien marking and pledge of securities for raising loans against G-Secs.The need for appropriate risk management in the context of the G-Sec also needs to beemphasized. An important issue of concern is the lack of uniform accounting standards forderivatives and the lack of transparent appropriateness standards. In the interest ofsystemic safety, further developments in the derivatives markets in terms of moreinstruments and wider participation base also need to be synchronized with effectiveaccounting and disclosure norms in line with international best practices.As far as the corporate bond market is concerned, the Government of India’sEconomic Survey 2006-07, observed that “ Outlook in infrastructure will depend on howinvestment in infrastructure is facilitated. Such investment requires long-term funds with longpay back periods, for example, from insurance and pension funds. Thus, success on theinfrastructure front will be facilitated by the development of a vibrant bond market, andpension and insurance reforms. ” (para 9.102) Further development of the corporate bondmarket would entail diversification and expansion of investor interest, which would, in turnnecessitate institutional measures for credit enhancement. This is already facilitated by theprevalence of credit rating institutions in India (all the three major rating agencies arerepresented in India). Credit risk could also be addressed by developing bond insuranceinstitutions. Institutional investors with superior risk assessment capacity along withinvestment capacity could also take on the role of credit enhancers. In addition, the issuerand instrument base needs to be widened through encouragement of segments likemunicipal bonds, mortgage backed securities and general securitized paper, in order tomeet the diverse requirements of investors and issuers in respect of the corporate bondmarket.22ANNEXIMF/World Bank Guidelines for Public Debt Management: The Indian PositionSr. No. Guideline Status1. Debt Management Objectives and Coordination1.1 Objectives The Reserve Bank of India, as the Government’s debtmanager, is guided by the twin objectives of minimisationof interest cost over time and rollover risk.1.2 Scope The RBI manages the internal marketable debt  of theCentral Government by statute. Internal marketable debtaccounts for 40 per cent of the total outstanding debt ofthe Central Government, whereas net market borrowingsaccount for around 77 per cent of the GFD. The RBImanages the internal marketable debt of the StateGovernments under voluntary agreements. Internalmarketable debt accounts for around 20 per cent of thetotal outstanding liabilities of the State Governmentswhereas net market borrowings account for around 20 percent of their GFD.1.3 Coordinationwith monetaryand fiscalpoliciesWith a view to moving towards functional separationbetween debt management and monetary operations, theRBI constituted a new department viz., the FinancialMarkets Department in July 2005.Coordination between debt management, monetary andfiscal policies is achieved via (i) the Financial MarketsCommittee of the RBI that meets daily to review thedevelopments, on a daily basis, in various marketsegments and bring about co-ordination in monetary,exchange and debt management; (ii) the StandingCommittee on Cash and Debt Management that consistsof representatives of the Central Government and the RBIthat meets periodically to examine issues relating to debtmanagement and ensure co-ordination of various policyinstruments; (iii) a Standing Technical Committee hasbeen constituted recently with representatives from allState Governments, the Central Government and the RBIto advise on the wide-ranging issues relating to theborrowing programmes of Central and StateGovernments through a consensual and co-operativeapproach.2. Transparency and Accountability2.1 Clarity of Roles,Responsibilitiesand objectivesThe allocation of responsibilities between the CentralGovernment and the RBI (which is both the debt managerand the monetary authority) for the formulation andexecution of debt management policy is clearly defined bylaw (Constitutional provisions, RBI Act, GovernmentSecurities Act) and is publicly disclosed.The Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL) acts as aclearing house and a central counterparty throughnovation in the transactions of Government securities.23The objectives of debt management (as given in 1.1) areset out in the Annual Report of the RBI, as a part of thereview of debt management policy and operations.2.2 Open processfor formulatingand reporting ofdebtmanagementpoliciesRegulations and procedures for primary auctions, primarydealer activities and secondary market operations in G-Secs are publicly disclosed.2.3 Publicavailability ofinformation ondebtmanagementpoliciesThe budgets of the Central and State Governmentsprovide information on the past, present and futurebudgetary activities and the financing of the fiscal deficit.Government budgets are also analysed in variouspublications of the RBI including its Annual Report. Theconsolidated financial position of the Central and StateGovernments is reported in the RBI\'s Annual Report. Theconsolidated financial position of the Central and StateGovernments as also of their public sector enterprises isreported in the Central Government\'s annual EconomicSurvey.The budget of the Central Government providesinformation on the stock and composition of its debt andfinancial assets. Various aspects of the internalmarketable debt of the Central and State Governmentsare analysed in the RBI\'s Annual Report.Indicative auction calendars for dated securities andTreasury Bills of the Central Government are issued on ahalf-yearly basis and annual basis, respectively.The RBI announces auction results soon after the auctionvia press releases on its website.The RBI regularly issues statistical information on theprimary and secondary markets for Governmentsecurities. These can also be accessed on the RBI’swebsite.Real time information on trades in Government securitieson the Negotiated Dealing System are issued on theRBI\'s website.2.4 Accountabilityand assurancesof integrity byagenciesresponsible fordebtmanagementThere is a system of annual statutory audit of the ReserveBank operations which covers the debt managementactivities. The debt management activities are alsocovered by concurrent audit. In addition, there is aninternal Management Audit and Systems Inspection whichfocuses on the macro management of debt activities. Theannual accounts of the RBI are audited by externalauditors and published in its Annual Report.3. Institutional Framework3.1 Governance As indicated in 2.1 above, the organizational frameworkfor debt management is clearly specified by law and themandates of the respective players are clear.24An annual review of debt management operations issubmitted to the central board of directors of the RBI.3.2 Management ofinternaloperations andlegaldocumentationDebt management activities are supported by an accurateand comprehensive management information system withproper safeguards.The debt manager has access to methodologies andmodels for cost-effective debt management. Debtmanagement is supported by an in-house researchdepartment which carries out analytical work periodically.The Reserve Bank of India has a Legal Department whichtenders legal advice, as and when necessary, on wide-ranging issues including debt management. Efforts aremade to ensure that all transactions and policy measureshave sound legal basis.4. DebtManagementStrategyAs indicated in 1.1 above, the Reserve Bank of India, asthe Government’s debt manager, is guided by the twinobjectives of minimisation of interest cost over time androllover risk. An indicative calendar of G-secs is issued.Borrowing decisions are guided, inter-alia, by the(expected) cash flows of the Government, marketconditions, the repayment schedule and fiscal andmacroeconomic indicators.5. Risk Management Framework5.1 Scope forActiveManagementA policy of passive consolidation through reissuance/reopenings was started in 1999 in order to improvefungibility among the securities and to facilitateconsolidation of debtA scheme for active consolidation of G-Secs is beingframed in consultation with the Central Government.Stress testing is, however, yet to be introduced.5.2 ContingentLiabilitiesInformation on the guarantees of the Central and StateGovernments are collated and reported in variouspublications of the RBI including its Annual Report. TheFiscal Responsibility Legislations of the CentralGovernment and many of the State Governments providefor a ceiling on guarantees. The possible impact ofguarantees is taken into consideration in borrowingdecisions.6. Development and Maintenance of an Efficient Market for GovernmentSecurities6.1 PortfolioDiversificationand InstrumentsUsually plain vanilla bonds (of various maturities) areissued. Through the 1990s, various types of instrumentshave been introduced, like zero coupon bonds, capitalindexed bonds, floating rate bonds and bonds with calland put options.The introduction of STRIPs is being envisaged and will beundertaken as and when the enabling legislation isenacted.25Initiatives are continuously taken to broaden the investorbase for G-secs. Some of the measures include primarydealers, non-competitive bidding facility and promotion ofgilt mutual funds. Withholding tax (Tax Deducted atSource) has already been abolished for G-secs. FIIs arepermitted to invest in securities issued by the Central andState Governments by an incremental amount of 5 percent of total net issuance in the previous financial year.This is over and above the current stipulation ofinvestment up to US $ 2 billion.6.2 Primary Market Dated securities (of various maturities) and Treasury Bills(91-, 182- and 364-day tenor) of the Central Governmentare issued through competitive auctions. A non-competitive route is also available in respect of datedsecurities and Treasury Bills to encourage widerparticipation and retail holding. The issuance datedsecurities of the State Governments has progressivelytransited (completely) to the auction route in 2006-07 sofar.As per the provisions of the FRBM Act, the RBI cannotparticipate in the primary auctions of Central G-secs (RBIdoes not participate in the primary auctions of State G-secs).A system of Primary Dealers is in place for underwritingprimary issuances of G-secs.6.3 SecondaryMarketPursuance of sound monetary policy with the twinobjectives of price stability  and growth.Supporting market participants (FIMMDA, PDAI, etc) intheir efforts to develop codes of conduct for marketparticipants and to ensure best practices.Promotion of an active repo market.Removal of TDS from G-secs. G-secs are also notsubject to Securities Transaction Tax (STT) applicable toequities.An ordinance has recently been passed to remove thefloor (25 per cent) on SLR.Settlement of government securities and funds is beingdone on a Delivery vs. Payments (DvP) basis in thebooks of the RBI since 1995. With the introduction ofClearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL) in February2002, which acts as clearing house and a centralcounterparty, the problem of gridlock of settlements hasbeen reduced.Providing information on the G-Sec market on highfrequency basis.26References1.

It is my pleasure to be here today again, at  the FIMMDA-PDAI annual c onference as we enter into a new decade. The last decade in the Indian  financial sector has been a forward continuum marked by significant developments. It was in 1999 that guidelines for interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements were first introduced. 1999 was also the year when FEMA was enacted and since then it has been a process of measured  opening up of the capital account. That was also the time when the LAF framework for modulating short term liquidity wa s introduced and a plan was put in place for making uncollateralized ca ll money market as a pure inter-bank market. Looking back, we have come along a long way. One thing that perhaps connects through the regulatory approach during this period has been the pursuit of financial stability. Some may be surprised to note that as far back  as the start of this decade, th e conceptualization of financial stability had been ingrained into the macro- economic and policy framework of the RBI. There was a stated focus on the need to treat financial stabi lity as a dominant objective of macroeconomic management and as a necessary, if not the sufficient, condition for accelerating economic growth1. Financial stability, of course, has acq uired its rightful pl ace as a key policy objective globally since the onset of crisis. 2. In my address last year, I had touched upon some of the burni ng issues that the global policy makers were grappling with. The financial markets have since stabilised a nd there is recovery in risk appetite but this primarily reflects the unprecedented and extraordinary policy measures taken by central ba nks and governments. Public sector assu med the role of not only the lender but also the risk taker of last resort. Much water has flown in the interregnum and in terms of outcomes, at the very least, we have a comm on minimum globally agreed program for repairing the financial system. The key elements of this pr ogram are: a strengthened capital adequacy  and liquidity regime for banks, developing a framework for system ically important entities and resolution arrangements, extending the regulator y perimeter to unregulated pools of money, de-risking the OTC derivatives trad ing and new frameworks for regul ating compensation within the financial sector. The main action on the above progr am is primarily concentrated on both sides of the Atlantic for obvious reasons. However, most of the other countries, including India, have agreed to the broad commitments bei ng driven by the G20 and the FSB.  3. My address today will be in two parts. In the first part I propose to discuss broad issues relating to financial market regulation and in the second part will briefly review the key developments in major markets in I ndia and certain unsettled issues.  I. Regulatory approach for markets 4. In the post crisis scenario, the new important variable that is being sought to be addressed globally is the oversight of systemic risk. It is  being acknowledged that institutional regulation alone is not sufficient in capturing and addressing systemic risks and it is imperative to have a  1 RBI Annual Report 1999-2000 Page  | 2                                                  mechanism to monitor and act upon the risks inherent in the interc onnectedness across the financial system – a macro-prudential approach to re gulation and supervisi on. It is recognized that systemic risk is created endogeneously rather than having exogeneous origins beyond the remit of financial markets.   Macro-prudential regulation – The Concept 5. Macroprudential approach, generically, can be de fined as policy that focuses on the financial system as a whole, and also treats aggregate risk as endogenous with regard to collective behaviour of institutions. It aims to limit syst em wide distress so as to avoid output costs associated with financial instability2. The underlying philosophy of m acro-prudential regulation is that behind the individual prudence of fina ncial firms may underlie systemic problems caused by their collective behavior. A recen t Bank of England discussion paper3 interprets macroprudential policy as lying on a spectru m with monetary policy at one end and microprudential policy at the other,  concerned with the stability of the aggregate provision of financial intermediation services to the real economy.     6. The two key elements of macro-prudential regulation4 that have acquired maximum attention are one, existence of common (correlated) exposures which arise either because institutions are directly exposed to the same or similar asset cla sses or because of indirect exposures associated with linkages among them (e.g. counterparty re lationships) and two, co llective homogeneous actions on the part of institutions resultin g in amplification of risks because of interconnectedness, the pro-cyclicality element.   7. Integral to the above approach  is also the role of financial markets – by and in themselves, different market segments, assessed in terms of th e usual metrics such as liquidity, turnover, etc. may be functioning absolutely well, but there may still be underlying systemic vulnerabilities arising out of the interactions of different ma rket participants, both regulated as well as unregulated, across different markets.   8. However, there is still no c oherent framework emerging for re gulation of financial markets from a stability perspective. Indeed, the join t IMF-BIS-FSB paper on assessing the Systemic Importance of Financial Institutions, Markets and Instruments also acknowledges that the assessment of systemic importance of markets pr esents more conceptual challenges than for institutions. In the area of reforming markets, the singular area of action has been to address counterparty risks and non-transparency in the OTC market by taking all such markets onto central clearing platforms. Other elements impi nging on market functioning flow from the focus on entity regulation such as addressing excessive leverage, higher capital charge for trading and securitization transactions.   2 Borio, Claudio: Implementing the macroprudential approach to financial regulation and supervision , September 2009, Financial Stability Review, Banque de France   3 Bank of England, “The role of macroprudential policy ”, November 2009, Discussion Paper,   4 Borio, Claudio: Implementing the macroprudential approach to financial regulation and supervision , September 2009, Financial Stability Review, Banque de France Page  | 3                                                  9. Holistically speaking, regula tion of financial markets  per se would involve two separate strands, apart from entity regulation : (i) policy framework that includes the product sp ecifications, macro level regulations that apply to all entities operating in this market, systemic  safeguards, nature of participants, reporting requirements etc.  (ii) operational aspects of trading an d post-trade clearing and settlement; 10. The concept of market regulation in most of the developed financial centres has largely been concentrated around the operational aspects of trading – the conduct of business part and has left prudential focus to entity regulation. More im portantly, there was no e xplicit policy framework for markets from a stability perspective. Mr. Ho ward Davies, the previous chairman of the FSA recently admitted that “The political mood, and certainly the mood in the markets, was that regulators should observe how mar kets evolved and try to  craft their regulatory environment to cope with the risks that emerged. We ha ve now seen that an approach of that sort  can step too far back...We now can see that if you step to o far back, trends can develop in a way which creates trouble, and that there needs to be, I th ink, more self-confidence in the regulatory world to be prepared to step in at an earlier stage  and to challenge the judgm ents of the markets.”511. It is surprising that this paradoxical approach Mr. Howard Davies talks about is not being altered even now though there is recognition of th e need to monitor system ic interconnectedness. The macro-prudential approach to regulation, now being consid ered imperative for financial entities, is still some way from being applied to financial markets.  12. Just to illustrate, one of the arguments ag ainst the way financial products have evolved relates to the problem of information asymmetr ies: the gulf between the market makers and market takers. Large financial firms run huge positions across multiple assets and have the ability as well as incentive to move markets in a way advantageous for them. This is not merely an exaggerated concern: there are increasing numb er of articles trying to interpret the link between the creation and selling of CDOs by larg e investment firms on underlying securities of doubtful nature prior to the cris is and simultaneously going short. In plain words, on the one hand you sell the derivatives  to less informed investors betti ng on the upside, while at the same time place huge bets to gain yourself from the downs ide. Here comes the systemic perspective in regulation: what may be good for a particular entity may be sowing seeds of instability for the system.  13. As part of general public discourse many inte resting issues are bei ng raised and debated fiercely, particularly relating to the social good being contributed by the markets and the systemic implications of some of the innovation s. I came across an interesting classification of opinionists in the context of the raging debate on  climate change – calamitists and denialists at the two extremes and warners and skeptics somewhere in the middle6. Through the crisis, there have been similar voices in the co ntext of the role of markets. On  one end of the spectrum are the  5 Interview to the Wall Street Journal, D ecember 13, 2009, Future of Finance Initiative 6 Stewart Brand, “Four Sides to Every Story ”, www.edge.org Page  | 4  denialist notions that there is inherently nothing wrong with the markets and the primary drivers for the crisis lay in the macro-economic realm. At  the other end, there are the calamitists arguing for a radical shift in the way markets are regulated since they have failed spectacularly. The truth, as usual may lie somewhere in the middle. Some key issues have indeed been acknowledged and are being addressed. There have been broad agreements on the principles, the problem is that these are th e common minimum principles a nd the implementation is being driven by contextual is sues in each country. Interconnectedness 14. The crisis has highlighted the importan ce of improving our unde rstanding of inter-connectedness in the financial system through dire ct links between financial institutions and the indirect links created through financial markets. The key channels  of propagation of risks are maturity mismatches and leverage.   15. In regard to direct links, there is need fo r bringing all inter-bank/intra-financial system exposures both on and off-balance sheet within the macro pruden tial framework. While there are prudential requirements for individual bank’s exposur es to other banks, there is appreciation of the need to prescribe safeguards on the liabilities  side of the balance sh eet too and to ensure availability of adequate good quality liquid assets.   16. The growth in financial sector over the pa st few years has been exponential. While many have argued that this has also contributed to real economy growth, behind the numbers lays the critical role of leverage and off-balance sheet financing. As me ntioned in the Turner Review, from about 2003 onwards there were significant increases in the measured on-balance sheet leverage of many commercial and investment banks, driven in some cases by dramatic increases in gross assets and derivative positions. This coupled with the growth  of ‘shadow banking’ meant that the so-called benefits from financia l sector growth have been mostly illusory.  17. Firms whose business models were based on high leverage and excessive dependence on uninterrupted access to secured f unding markets were highly vulnera ble in the crisis. Many firms relied on excessive short-term wholesale financi ng of long term illiquid assets including on cross border basis. During the crisis they were faced with lenders demanding s ubstantial cushions or haircuts on the assets they were willing to finance.  Moreover, these assets taken as collateral were illiquid and lenders failed to factor in this  risk.  This combined with excessive leverage accentuated the vulnerability.  18. The excessive dependence of entities on whol esale funding markets such as repo or other collateralised markets is an issue of systemic  concern since one, it accentuates systemic procyclicality through haircuts/margins and tw o, the leverage loop that builds through these markets in high liquidity periods induces rigidity and gets entren ched into funding models of entities. It is therefore imperative to bring the secured funding markets such as repo markets within the regulatory perimete r/macro prudential framework, pa rticularly since many entities participating in these markets are unregulated/lightly regulated. There is need for a cautious approach when the securities that are repo'ed/col lateralised carry credit risk and are illiquid.   Page  | 5  19. This also raises the issue of interconnectedness of banks to private pools of capital that are largely unregulated. While the reform of the fi nancial system does cover regulation of hedge funds, the general issue of banks exposures to these funds directly as well as through markets needs greater attention. The same applies to private equity which are unregulated entities. These entities rely on funding markets fo r leverage. From a macro prudent ial perspective it is not just necessary to regulate  banks exposures to these entities but also to limit the overall leverage of these entities  if they are permitted to access  funds directly from banks and other financial intermediaries and indirectly via funding markets.  OTC market infrastructure 20. A large number of initiatives are underway at the international le vel to strengthen the infrastructure for OTC derivatives, a clear amplifie r of stress particularly in credit derivatives market in the crisis as evidenced by AIG, B ear Stearns, Lehman episodes. The deficiencies within the OTC derivatives market viz. the ma nagement of counterparty credit risk and the absence of sufficient transparency have pushed the policy preference to exchange traded/centrally cleared models. However the specific proposals being discussed in various countries do envisage continuance of non-standardised OTC cont racts albeit with a stricter bilateral collaterali zation requirement and higher capital charge.  21. Increasingly more nuanced pers pectives on this issue are being articulated, the most recent one being the discussion paper of December 2009 from the HMT and the FSA in UK which argues against the need for mandating the trad ing of standardized derivatives on organized trading platforms provided steps are taken to impr ove transparency and mitigate the risks of OTC derivatives. According to this paper regulatory objectives of reducing counterparty risk and improving transparency can be achieved by ot her means and they would review progress of initiatives in this area. Moreover, mandating the use of organised platforms would imply a regulatory imposition of trading structure, whic h they do not believe is necessary. The paper argues that mere standardisabil ity cannot be a sufficient conditio n for central clearing and other factors such as availability of prices, depth of market liquidity and whether the product contains inherent risk attributes that cannot be mitigated by the CCP need to be considered by regulators.   22. The essence of a CCP arrangement is netting and margining, which are contingent on homogeneity of the underlying asset, availability  of reliable prices and sound risk models to capture future potential exposures. The abilit y of models to capture  tail risks has been comprehensively put to question post crisis. How would the exchanges be better able to measure and manage risk where some of the biggest financial firms with  the soundest risk management systems failed?  This would be part icularly true of cred it products such as CDS. In this context, the nature of collateral regime becomes extremely important. Any in strument with a  credit risk element would inherently not be suitable for a co llateral. If these aspect s are not addressed by the regulators, mandatory clearing would only resu lt in a potentially riskier system.     23. The real sector i.e. end users are opposing mandatory move to exchanges and clearing platforms on the ground that the crisis was inherently due to complex transactions between financial intermediaries and there should be no incr ease in cost to the real  sector, i.e. genuine end-users, for undertaki ng derivative trades.  Page  | 6                                                  24. Currently, a CPSS-IOSCO Committee is looking in to the existing standards for the systemic entities like the CCP. Given the natu re of their functions which require incentives for strong risk management and building adequate financial reso urces in the form of settlement guarantee funds and their systemic importance, it  is worthwhile to consider cen tral counterparties as “public utility” and not-for profit ent ities to reduce moral hazard.   25. A key criticism of the proposed reforms has been that it doesn’t a ddress the fundamental issue of speculative use of derivatives and excessi ve financialisation of a ll products. In fact, by transferring most of OTC market onto exchanges, it might be further accentuating it. It is not surprising to hear major global exchanges as well as brokers bett ing on a manifold increase in the CDS market as a result of electronic trading and centr al clearing. A recent study7 has found that of the gross CDS position of 23 large US Banks  only around 2 per cent was for hedging the rest was for their dealer activities. T hough the figures pertain to 2005, they  give a fair idea of really how much of the CDS market was actually for pure speculation. Speculation does play an economic role in increasing market liquidity and price discovery but beyond a point, trading without an underlying interest co uld only increase systemic risk particularly when the same market prices and volatilities get entrenched into the balan ce sheets of the real sector.  Rating Agencies 26. Another area where progress has been slow rela tes to the rating agencies. There have been some proposals to mitigate conflicts between raters and issuers who pay them but these have largely been in the nature of more disclo sures by rating agencies and separation of the consultancy/advisory roles. Some of the funda mental issues have been left unaddressed, particularly the methodological issues, accountabili ty arrangements and over-stretching of rating agencies. A key issue that has not been addressed is the ratings given by rating agencies based on implicit support without the need  to disclose the rating status  without such implicit support. From the point of view of transparency to inve stors and accountability there is need for further disclosures in this regard.   Capital account management  27. For emerging countries the macro prudential fram ework has also to deal  with vulnerability arising from cross-border capital flows, currenc y mismatches and foreign currency liquidity in the financial system. Rapid and vo latile capital inflows or outflows can present significant policy challenges—potentially leading to  exchange rate overshooting, asse t price volatilit y and financial instability. In this context, appr opriate and pragmatic use of cap ital account regulations may have to be considered by emerging markets in order to  maintain financial stability if considered necessary.     7 Minton, Bernadette, René M. Stulz, and Rohan Williamson, January 2008, “ How much do banks use credit derivatives to hedge loans?, Fisher College of Business Working Paper Series  Page  | 7                                                  Market Discipline 28. In the past, it has been argue d that market discipline can pl ay a key role in incentivising market participants to limit their excessive risk taking activities. However, the events of the last few years have proved the inadequacy of market discipline and bankers have been engaged in risk-taking activities disguised as value-creation. Time and again market participants have engaged in herd behaviour and put the financia l system at risk. It is poignant to note how relevant Charles Mackay’s observation in his popular book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and Madness of Crowds, written  in 1841, even today . Mackay wrote , ‘‘Men, it has been well said think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one”. The events of the past few years tell us that  market discipline expressed via market prices canno t be expected to play a major role in constraining risk taking, and that the primary constraint needs to  come from regulation and supervision.  29. So how do we manage the trad e-off between financial stability, effective regulations on the one hand and free markets on the other? One, the responsibility for financial stability cannot be fragmented across several regulato rs; it has to rest unambiguously with a single entity, and that single entity optimally is the cen tral bank. And second, that there is need for coordination across regulators on a regular basis and for developing a protocol for re sponding to a crisis situation8.   30. In my opinion, any regulation that is envisa ged should be based on the touchstone of the following: Regulations that does not lead to exce ssive leverage of not only financial institutions, but also of households and corporates. Regula tions that augment the market process and strengthen the invisible hand. Regulations that address the info rmation problems associated with complex financial instruments and improve the transparency of instruments and institutions.  Regulations that acknowledge and address the system ically important nature of key markets that have wider implications for the real economy. Regulations that recognize and address the country specific circumstances.   Part II – Indian context 31. Having touched upon some of the broad issues for financial regulation in the context of emerging global consensus, let me turn to the Indi an context. I would like to briefly review the key developments in major markets and try to flag some of the unsettled issues.   Money Markets 32. The overnight rates have an important contributory role in terms of managing day to day liquidity  and as a point of origin for building expectations on the term structure of interest rates. Domestically, while the overnight rates have mo re or less remained around the corridor in the recent past, the daily cash maintained by the banking system with RBI– one of the most important determinants of the overnight rates -  have remained highly volatile as compared to the required CRR balances.   8 Subbarao, Duvvuri , Financial Stability: Issues and Challenges , September 2009  Page  | 8  0246810121416%The Interest rate corridor and the daily weighted average overnight rate R everse repo Rat e R epo-60000-40000-20000020000400006000080000100000Difference b/ w actual & required cash balance 33. Therefore, despite the daily overnight rates remaining around th e interest rate  corridor, the daily absolute change in the weighted average rates have not been smooth.     -6.00-4.00-2.000.002.004.006.008.00%Changes i n Pol i cy Rat esChange in Repo Rate Ch an ge  i n  Re v e r se  Re p o  Rat e-6.00-4.00-2.000.002.004.006.008.00%Changes in Weighted Average Overnight Rates 34. While we are all aware of the skewed distribution of liquidity  in the banking system due to different balance sheet sizes of  the banks, the rapid roll-out of RTGS system and the core banking solutions perhaps offers us an opportunity  to go back to the drawing board and optimize the day to day liquidity management to redu ce the opportunity costs and more importantly improve the ability to lend on term basis.  The term money market continues to remain dormant with low turnover despite severa l initiatives taken by the Reserv e Bank, mainly reflecting the inability of the market participants to take a medium-term view on interest rates and liquidity, corporates’ continued preference for cash cred it and other modes of loan disbursements. However, the CD market is active and  refl ects the unsecured term money market rates.   35. RBI has addressed the issue of vulnerabilities  arising from excessive intra financial sector activity by limiting the unsecured overnight market  to banks and primary dealers and imposing limits on unsecured borrowing and lending in overnight markets as also by limiting the gross  interbank liabilities.   36. On the market infrastructure side, over the y ears, the collateralised se gment of money market has assumed increasing importance for the entire  gamut of market players including non-banks without engendering financial instability. All co llateralized trad es including market repos are settled through a CCP. These developments have contributed to the increased transparency and liquidity in these markets and imparted stability to the financial markets.  Page  | 9  37. On the regulatory front, the gap that existed in  the case of NCDs with maturities less than one year has received the regulatory attention. Non Convertib le Debentures of maturity of less than one year are being issued with i nnovative features such as, interest  rates linked to overnight rate, American style put/call optionality, which impa rts demand liability character to these instruments. Further, the innovative features and the high amount of  issuance of such instruments pose systemic risks. The suggestion of the market participants in expandi ng the eligible entities that can act as Debenture Trustees for the issuance of NCDs with less than one year maturities is being examined  by the Reserve Bank. However, the suggestion for relaxing the minimum tenor of these NCDs from the proposed tenor of 90 days to 7 days cannot be acceded to as under the law, corporates are prohibited from issuing unsecured debentures  with maturity of less than 90 days. Allowing markets to issue very short-term instruments can have systemic implications.  In any case, there are other instruments in the shor t-end like repo, CBLO and CPs that can meet the requirement of investors. Fixed income markets 38. The fixed income markets in India, as is th e case with the develope d world is dominated by the Government securities markets. A lot has been  done to develop the market infrastructure for the Government securities markets in the past tw o decades and most of the issues that remains now have to do with the development of the non-bank non- instituti onal interests in the government securities. In India, th e reasons for lack of retail intere st lies in the availability of alternative instruments with higher yields and better tax treatm ent and the small savings window for those in need of risk free instruments.  Nevertheless, the experience gained in the development of the Government securities market  microstructure will stand us in good stead in further development of the Corporate Bond mark ets and certain other segments of the money markets mentioned earlier.  Government securities market 39. Of the various reforms towards development of  the Government securities market, the most significant one, I must say was the issuance of G-secs through auction, followed and backed by development of market infrastructure such as trade reporting platforms for real time dissemination, DvP and CCP clearing and settlement .   Introduction and gradual relaxation of repo has also significantly contri buted to the liquidity.The Reserve Bank has also taken up the revision of repo accounting to reflect the true economic essence of the transaction on the books of both the repo seller as well as th e repo buyer.  The final guidelines are set to be issued shortly.    Initiatives to widen investor base 40. In last few years, many initiatives have been  taken to widen the i nvestor base in G-Sec Market. The Reserve Bank, in consultation with th e Central Government and State Governments, has introduced the Non-Competitive Bidding in the Auction of Central Government securities and State Development Loans. NDS-OM has been  extended to insurance companies, qualified Mutual Funds, Provident Funds and Pension Funds  in a phased manner. Further, changes have been made in the manner in which bids are submitt ed in the auctions of the Government of India securities so as to improve the efficiency of th e auction procedure as also the timeliness of data dissemination.   Page  | 10  41. With the average daily trading volumes of  about Rs. 13,000 crore a nd Rs. 22,000 crore in outright and repo market respectively , the G-sec markets are on the growth path.    Primary Dealers  42. With an objective to render the Government Securities market vibrant, liquid and broad based, the Reserve Bank introduced the system of Primary Dealer s (PDs) in 1995. In order to broad base the Primary Dealership system, banks were permitted to undertake Primary Dealership business departmentally in 2006-07. Fu rther, the standalone PDs were permitted to diversify into other business activities. With the induction of two new PDs in 2009, there are currently 19 PDs comprising 11 banks undertak ing PD business departmentally and eight standalone PDs.  As you are aware, in vi ew of the underwriting and market making responsibility of PDs, they have been given ac cess to Current Account facility and Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) Account facility (for Gove rnment securities) with  the Bank, permission to borrow and lend in the money market including call money market and to trade in all money market instruments, membership of electronic dealing, trading and se ttlement systems (NDS platforms/INFINET/RTGS/CCIL), access to the Liquidity Adjustme nt Facility (LAF) of RBI, access to liquidity support from RBI under a scheme  separately notified for standalone PDs and favoured access to open market operations by the Reserve Bank.   Performance of PDs in Primary Auctions of Government Securities 43. The share of PDs (ratio of bids accepted from  PDs to the total notified amount) in primary auctions of Central Government dated securities  (Table 1) has been significant since 2006 when the Bank stopped participating in primary auctions , ensuring full subscription to the Government securities.  Table 1: Performance of PDs in primar y auctions of Government securities                                                                                                                      (In Rs. cr ore) Details 2006-07 2007-08 2008-09 2009-10 *   Notified Amount          146,000           156,000           261,000                           295,000  Bids Submitted by PDs          202,462           254,253           349,393                           361,325  Bids accepted of PDs            64,727             72,122           111,094                           117,023  Bid-to-cover ratio 1.39 1.63 1.34 1.22 Success Ratio 31.97% 28.37% 31.80% 32.39% Share of PDs 44.33% 46.23% 42.56% 39.67% * - till end-September 2009 Source: Trend & Progress 2009      Page  | 11  Recent initiatives 44. In view of the enhanced borrowings by th e Government of India in 2008-09 and 2009-10 as part of the counter-cyclical po licy in response to slowdown, stru ctured meetings with PDs and other major investors were taken up on a regular basis to obtain market feedback and exchange views on relevant issues.  The major initia tives taken during the current fiscal are:  (i) Consequent to the global financial crisis, the spread  between corporate bond and Government securities turned out more than 500  bps due to credit crunch in the financial markets.  To enable the PDs to raise Tier II  and Tier III capital, ceiling on interest rate spread at the time of issue of the subordinated instrument s was removed effective from April 1, 2009.  (ii) Stand-alone PDs were allowed to categorize a portion of their Government Security portfolio in the HTM cat egory till March 31, 2010.  (iii)In order to aid stand-alone PDs in managi ng their funding requirement, PDs are allowed to borrow from call money market, on an average in a fortnight, up to 225 per cent up from 200 per cent.  (iv) In the backdrop of global financia l crisis and the need to have  strongly capitalized entities to ensure financial stability, the minimum NOF for stand-alone PDs undertaking only G-sec business, was increased from Rs. 50 cror e to Rs. 150 crore and for the stand-alone PDs, which intend to undertak e other permissible activities, NOF is enhanced to Rs.250 crore from the existing level of Rs. 100 cror e. The enhanced level of NOF requirement shall be effective from April 1, 2010.  (v) PDs are allowed to deal in Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) for both hedging and trading on own account .  45. The RBI is impressing upon the PDs to expand their outreach to widen the investor base for government securities and act as  market makers for the smalle r entities in non-institutional segment.  Corporate Bond Market :   46. Corporate Bond market segment has received inte nse attention in recent times as it has been identified as one of the growth engines for furt her development of the Indian economy with vast infrastructure needs.  A well developed corporat e bond market not only enables the corporates to tap the markets for their financing needs and resu lt in efficient allocation of resources but also acts as a much desired supplement for the bank fi nancing thereby reducing the systemic stress.  There has been a spurt in the secondary market  activity in the corporate bond markets.  The secondary market volumes have gone up from  Rs. 5000 crore in 2007 to about Rs.30,000 crore in 2009. The bond issuance through private placement in the first half of 2009-10 has shown an increase of 25 per cent over the corresponding period previous year, with financial service sector accounting for 71 per cent of the mobilization. The F IIs have been allowed to invest up to $15 bn in corporate bonds. The actual utili zation is however very low. Th e streamlining of clearing and settlement processes by mandating the DvP settlemen t of corporate bonds is expected to increase the market activity including public issues by mitigating the settlement risks.    47. Introduction of OTC repo in corporate bonds, as already a nnounced, would further enhance the secondary market activity by encouraging more  participants to hold bonds.  However, we Page  | 12                                                  need to tread with prudence since the repo fac ilitates leverage. As indicated earlier secured funding markets globally were the key leverage-e nabling channels that played an exacerbating role during the crisis. While such collaterali zed funding markets generally help market integration by enabling participan ts to fund their long positions a nd deliver into short positions and by helping them to manage th eir short term liquidity needs, during times of crisis, the same mechanism may accentuate the crisis by forcing the borrowers into insolvency due to steep fall in the value of collaterals, lead ing to margin calls and fire sales (Gorton and Metrick, 2009).     48. The feedback received on the draft guidelines ha s largely been positive but the key issue that has been raised relates to  inclusion of short te rm money market instrume nts such as CDs/CPs as eligible securities for repo. To begin with, it is proposed to start only with highly rated bonds. The final guidelines in this re gard would be issued shortly.  Foreign Exchange Market 49. There has been a sharp increase in the liquid ity in the Indian forex market between 1997-98 and 2007-08, resulting from the nine fold increase in turnover over this period and low and stable bid-ask spreads9.  The 25% compounded annual growth in turnover and the doubling of the merchant to inter-bank turnover ratio during this period was reflective of   accelerated pace of economic growth and increased openness of the domestic financial markets. The turnover is almost equally accounted for by the spot and derivatives market s. The derivatives market is dominated by swaps followed by forwards. Curre ncy futures have also  been introduced in recognised stock exchanges since August 2008 to facilitate hedging by residents.   50. The sudden change in the external environm ent that started around mid-September 2008 led to heightened volatility in the currency market . The Rupee exhibited a sharp downward trend, like other emerging market currencies, in the backdrop of de-leveraging in global financial markets, sharp declines in equities markets an d deterioration in the inter-bank money markets prompting investors to shun emerging market a ssets. While FDI flows exhibited resilience, access to ECBs and trade credits was rendered somewhat difficult.  The net outflows under portfolio investment, banki ng capital and short-term trade cred it led to capital account balance having turned negative during the third quart er (October-December) of 2008-09, the first time since the first quarter of 1998-99.   51. In this context, the Reserve Bank took all pr eemptory actions as necessary to preserve orderly conditions in the markets. Apart from  undertaking market opera tions to bridge the demand supply gap, other measures were also taken such as upward adjustment of the interest rate ceiling on the foreign currency deposits by non-resident Indians, su bstantially relaxing the external commercial borrowings (ECB) regime for corporates, and allowing non-banking financial companies and housing finance compan ies to access foreign borrowing. The RBI had also introduced special forex sw aps of tenors up to three mont hs on November 7, 2008 in order to provide flexibility to Indian banks in mana ging their short-term funding requirements at their overseas offices.   9 BIS triennial survey 2007. In the aftermath of the failure of the Lehman brothers, bid-ask spreads increased sharply. Page  | 13                                                  52. The average daily turnover of FCY-INR in the foreign exchange  market (including forwards and FX swaps) decreased from USD 33.44 billio n in July 2008 to USD 29.45 billion in October 2009. While the turnover in the inter-bank segment fell from USD 25.48 billion to USD 20.23 billion, that in the merchant segment incr eased from USD 7.96 bill ion to USD 9.22 billion .    Derivatives Market  Interest Rate Derivatives 53. The interest rate deregulation not only made financial market operations efficient and cost-effective but also exposed participants to increased risks. The OIS market is the most widely used OTC derivative instrument in India for hedging interest rate risk, re flective of the absence of the term money market in India. The CCI L launched the reporting platform for OTC Rupee Interest Rate Swaps (IRS/FRA) in August 2007 and commenced non-guaranteed settlement in November 2008.  54. With most of the market microstructure of the G-sec market well estab lished, it set the stage for the re-launch of the Interest Rate Futures market in August 2009. RBI has on its part put in place the physical delivery infrastructure that crea tes an interface of the Public Debt Office with the clearing houses of the exchange s with near straight  through processing ability. RBI has also given its approval to the exchanges to reduce th e delivery period in the IRF to one single day. The market participants should ultimately harness the hedging poten tial that this product has to offer. One of the primary reasons for  going in for physi cal settlement in the IRF as against cash settlement was precisely to link the cash segmen t with the futures segment, which would be critical for hedging purposes.   55. Unlike in other markets, there is a regulat ory framework for OTC markets in cash and derivatives   markets in instruments coming under RBI regulatory purview. There is a role for  OTC markets since they can meet specific requir ements of end users. For the purpose of OTC interest rate derivatives we have classified the participants into market makers and users. These products have achieved considerable amount of st andardization that has in turn facilitated technological intervention. We have already achieved significant success in the trade reporting and settlement of these OTC interest rate products . We are therefore, significantly ahead on these parameters compared to most of the developed markets.   56. While there has been a significant bu ildup of outstanding notional principal10  the market participation is much skewed. As per the late st CCIL data, the foreign banks dominated the MIBOR swap market with an average share of 81.96% as against the shar e of the private banks at 11.76%, Primary Dealers at 5.7 9% and public sector banks at 0.49% during October’09.  Further, foreign banks dominate d the MIFOR swap market with an average share of 87.38% as against that of th e private banks at 11.79% an d public sector banks at  0.83% during October’09. There is, therefore, a clear need for some of  the participants to scale up their level of participation in these markets.    10 - As per CCIL data, as on November 27, 2009, the tota l outstanding notional principal (inter-bank and PDs only) under MIBOR OIS stands at Rs.25,72,339 crore and that under MIFOR-OIS stands at Rs.7,62,356 crore as at November 27, 2009. Page  | 14   Currency Derivatives 57. The traded volume in USD-INR currency futu res contracts traded on all the exchanges gradually increased over the period and touche d the high of USD 5.46 billion on December 8, 2009.  The average traded volume remained at USD 3384 million during November 2009. On the other hand, the open interest position in th e currency futures remained at around USD 1 billion during the month with the average of USD 1105 million.   58. The substantial rise in the cu rrency futures volume, in a sense,  is quite natural keeping in view cash settlement, the lack of requireme nt of underlying exposure and absence of any restriction on cancellati on and re-booking, as curr ently applicable in the case of forward transactions. In case of forward foreign ex change contracts, AD Category-I banks, through verification of documentary ev idence, have to be satisfied about the genuineness of the underlying exposure, irrespective of the transaction being a cu rrent or a capital account transaction.   59. There has been growing demands from the mark et participants to allow trading of currency future contracts in other major currency pairs to f acilitate direct hedging of  their exchange risk in such currencies. Accordingly, in  the second quarter review of monetary policy, it has been proposed to permit the recognized stock excha nges to offer currency futures contracts in currency pairs of Euro-INR, Japanese Yen-INR and Pound Sterling-INR.   60. RBI had placed on its website the draft guidelin es on OTC forex derivatives, in light of the developments in the domestic and internationa l financial markets and based on the feedback received from banks, market partic ipants, industry associations and others. It is proposed in the draft guidelines to permit the importers and export ers having foreign currency exposures in trade transactions, to write covered call and put op tions both in foreign currency-rupee and cross currency and also receive premia. Accordingly, th e facility of zero cost structures is to be withdrawn.   61. There have been concerns on the downside ri sk involved in allowing the exporters/importers to write covered call and put options. This is the precise reason why th e draft guidelines had stipulated stringent preconditions for use of such products. The AD category I banks have to ensure that the customers have sound risk ma nagement system, the corporates should have adopted AS 30 and AS 32, the corporates can not combine these options with any other derivative products and moreover, the pricing of the premium has to be done in a transparent manner. We have also received feedback to conti nue the facility of zero cost structures since some of the companies find the instrument usef ul in managing currency risks. However, the bundling of asymmetric risks makes it complex in pricing as well as in valuation and can be opaque to the risk managers and top management.       62. It is also proposed to continue to allow pe rsons resident in India,  other than banks and financial institutions to use FCY-INR swaps to transform long-term INR borrowing into foreign exchange liability.  There have been concerns that the use of FCY-INR swap to convert long term Rupee borrowing into foreign exchange liab ility may lead to speculative trades in the Page  | 15  absence of underlying risk exposures. However, this  facility has been in existence for a decade and has supported distribution of foreign currency risks within  the Indian market without increasing the overall external debt. Such a faci lity may come handy for a corporate, especially the exporters, having future foreign exchange receivables. The foreign exchange liability position assumed through FX swap may match w ith the foreign exchange receivables and provide the benefit of hedging. The issue is sh ould such swaps be limited to only companies which have potential forex exposures. The road ahead 63. On the anvil is the introduction  of credit default swaps. We are at an advanced stage of introducing other currency pairs for currency futures and are examining the issue of allowing plain vanilla currency options in consultation with SEBI.   64. Broadly speaking, the mandate for financial s ector development should ideally derive from the regulatory assessments for each market. It has been clearly evidenced during the crisis that financial sector development per se cannot be an objective in itself. It needs to be pursued in the broader context of financial stabil ity and has to n ecessarily correspond to th e level of maturity of the financial system and the needs of the real  economy. Reforming financial markets involves improving access to simple, transparent, and easy- to-understand products. Increasing complexity does not facilitate the market mechanism.  The purpos e of financial instruments is to transfer risk to those that understand these risks, not to hide or camouflage them. Regulatory comfort and assessment should therefore be a critical de terminant in pursuing financial reforms.  65. In regard to derivatives, we have both OTC and exchange traded instruments for currency and interest rates. OTC markets in India are we ll regulated, unlike many other jurisdictions, to address issues of leverage and customer appr opriateness and suitability. Only OTC contracts where one party to the transaction is a RBI regul ated entity is considered legally valid. Suitable reporting and post trade clearing  and settlement mechanisms are being further strengthened. Given the incentive structures of  these market, convergence of regulatory frameworks for OTC and exchange traded markets cannot be an end in itself under present ci rcumstances, though it is a long term goal.   66. The development of markets is also influenced  by tax policies. Debt instruments for instance do not enjoy tax exemptions of th e nature enjoyed by equity inst ruments whether on income or capital gains. Mutual funds fixed income products  enjoy certain tax examptions not available to banks. But this is outside the regulatory pur view. However, if these policies introduce any vulnerability in the financial system there is  need to address this through appropriate macroprudential and micropr udential regulations.  67. Based on the assessment and experience, further liberalization measures for expanding the product menu could be undertaken. However, particip ation of foreigners in new products and the financial markets in general would continue to  be dictated by the cap ital account management and financial stability imperatives.  68. Thank you. I wish the conference all success.  ""]"
